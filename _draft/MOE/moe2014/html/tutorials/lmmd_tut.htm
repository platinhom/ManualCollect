<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This tutorial examines the loop conformation of rho-kinase,
PDB entry 2F2U, to illustrate how to:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Run LowModeMD conformational search.</li>
<li>Perform protein loop sampling.</li>
<li>Reduce computational time by:
    <ul>
    <li>Restricting calculations to zones of interaction (atom shells);</li>
    <li>Reducing the degrees of freedom by fixing atoms next to
	the active zone;</li>
    <li>Using tethers to steer the search toward interesting conformations.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
The crystal structure of rho-kinase,
a serine/threonine-protein kinase,
contains a dimer, the two monomers of which exhibit different
conformations of the P-loop (Ile98-Val106). During binding, the
extended conformation folds further to lock in the bound ligand. The
first chain in the PDB file is in the extended loop conformation, while the
other instance (chain 3) is the fully folded conformation. The 7-membered
ring of the ligand (fasudil) adopts a different
orientation as a result of the P-loop motion. In this tutorial, we will
simulate the unbinding mechanism by starting from the folded state, and
generating the extended conformation via LowModeMD. When classical MD methods
are used for this purpose, even long simulations may fail to observe the
conformational switch [Godha&nbsp;2008].
The active zone of our model will consist of the P-loop and
the ligand (shown below in red), which will be fully flexible. The
neighboring residues (shown in yellow) will be fixed so that they can still be
sensed by the active molecules and finally the distant residues (gray) will be
inert. Thus, during the simulation, the red area
will move freely while it senses the geometry of the immobile yellow area.

</p>

<p><b>LowModeMD</b>.
LowModeMD is a conformational search method that uses implicit vibrational
analysis to focus a MD trajectory along the low-mode vibrations. This
has the effect of searching for minima along the valleys and troughs on the
potential energy surface. LowModeMD is the default conformational search
method in MOE because it is has the best overall performance on a wide set of
structures from small molecules to peptides, macrocycles, and protein loops.</p>

<p>LowModeMD can
be used for modeling proteins of known families (for example antibodies), for
studying the flexibility of certain structural regions of macromolecules such
as protein loops, and modeling of ligands and solvents in the active sites. It
can also be used for comprehensive conformational analysis of medium size molecules
such as short peptides and macrocycles. The method also allows tethers and constraints
to be added to the system. In this tutorial, we will use LowModeMD for conformational
search of a protein loop.</p>

<p><b>Protein Loop Sampling</b>.
Conformational search of a protein loop and similar large systems can be very
challenging due to the large number of degrees of freedom, complicated
non-bonded interactions, and the steric hindrance and
rigidity in the structure which impedes conformational switching.
Classical MD/MC methods tend to be very slow for this purpose, since they
spend most of the time near the equilibrium energy conformation, thus generating
structures with low conformational diversity. In this tutorial, we will
see how LowModeMD can explore the conformational space of a protein loop
efficiently by accentuating the conformational changes mostly on dihedral
rotations, i.e. the low mode conformational changes.</p>

<p>
<b>Defining shells (layers) of atoms</b>.
 When studying large molecular systems, often only local effects are
interesting; for example the interactions of a ligand with an active site,
or conformational changes of a certain loop. In such cases, forcefield
calculations can be accelerated by
ignoring atoms distant from the active zone, thereby
reducing the number of atoms taking part in the computations.
In MOE, such faraway atoms
can be made <i>inert</i>.  Inert atoms are effectively invisible during
forcefield calculations. MD calculations can be additionally accelerated by
reducing the number of degrees of freedom, for example by confining the
position of atoms neighboring the active zone. In this tutorial, we
will use proximity functions in MOE to define different
zones of interaction, setting the atoms within them
to inert or fixed to accelerate the LowModeMD calculation. It is also
possible to further steer the conformational search towards interesting
 conformations and save time using constraints and tether forces.
Here we will tether the ligand atoms to retain their approximate positions
in the active site. </p>

of the ligands.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="lmmd_tut/lmmd_fig04_twoconformers.png"
alt="MOE-LMMD" /></p>

</li>

<li>
<i>Select the unwanted chains.</i>

<p>
These include the extended conformation of the protein and its ligand,
plus all the water molecules. To do this, bring up the sequence editor
by clicking <span class="menu">SEQ </span> in the top right of the main MOE window. 
Click on chain 2:2F2U.B, then right click on it and from the pop-up menu that 
appears choose</p>

<p class="indent_novspace"><span class="menu">Extend | Letter</span></p>

<p>This will select everything associated with chain letter 'B', which is
the unwanted instance of protein in this PDB file. To add the remaining
water chain, hold <b>Ctrl</b> on keyboard and click on chain 5:2F2UA.
The result is shown below:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="lmmd_tut/lmmd_fig05_seq.png" alt="MOE-LMMD" /></p>
</li>
<li>

<i>Delete the selected chains.</i>
<p>Right click on one of the selected chains and from the pop-up
menu choose:</p>
<p class="indent_novspace"><span class="menu">Delete</span></p>
<p>Press <b>OK</b> in the confirmation dialog.</p>
</li>
<li>

<i>Prepare the system.</i>
<p>Run the Structure Preparation application:</p>

<p class="indent_novspace">
<span class="menu">MOE | Compute | Prepare | Structure Preparation
</span>
</p>

<p>Click <b>Correct</b> in the Structure Preparation panel. 
Once the calculation has finished, click on <span class="menu">Protonate3D...</span>, 
leave the default options and press <b>OK</b>. Finally click <b>Close</b> in the 
Structure Preparation panel.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<i>Fix all the atoms in the system.</i>

<p class="indent_novspace">
<span class="menu">
MOE | RHS | Select | All</span></p>
<p class="indent_novspace">
<span class="menu">MOE | RHS | Constrain | Fix
</span>
</p>

<p> This is the first step in creating a shell of fixed atoms around the active atoms.</p>

<p>
Next, clear the atom selection using
<span class="menu"> MOE | RHS | Select | Clear</span>.
Later on we will unfix the active atoms.</p>

</li>
<li>

<i>Define the active part of the model.</i>
<p>
The active part of our model will consist of the P-loop and the ligand. 
To select the P-loop, use the Sequence Editor. First enable synchronization between 
residue and atom selection:</p>

<p class="indent_novspace">
<span class="menu">
SE | Select | Synchronize
</span>
</p>

<p>
Next turn on the UID numberingby clicking the <img src="lmmd_tut/lmmd_aanumbering_icon.png" alt="MOE-LMMD" /> icon.
Then use the horizontal scroll bar to show the residues with UIDs
98-106. The P-loop will be highlighted in green in the Sequence Editor. Select the first residue by clicking on Ile98,
hold <b>Shift</b> on keyboard and click on the last residue of the P-loop (Val106). The Synchronize setting will ensure that
the atoms of these residues will be selected in the main MOE window.</p>

</li>
<li>

<i>Add the ligand to the current selection.</i>

<p class="indent_novspace">
<span class="menu">
MOE | RHS | Select | Ligand
</span>
</p>

</li>
<li>

<i>Unfix the selected atoms.</i>

<p>
<span class="menu">
MOE | RHS | Constrain | Unfix
</span>
</p>

<p> This will unfix the ligand and the P-loop atoms so that they can move freely during the simulation.</p>
</li>
<li>

<i>Render the selected atoms for better distinction.</i>

<p class="indent_novspace">
<span class="menu">
MOE | RHS | Show | Selected
</span>
</p>
<p class="indent_novspace">
<span class="menu">
MOE | Footer | Ribbon | Color | <i>red</i>
</span>
</p>


<p>
At this point, the active atoms (P-loop + ligand)
should still be selected. If the selection was
accidentally lost (for example by clicking on an empty area in the main MOE
window), since these are the only visible atoms on the screen they can be
re-selected by drawing a box around them while holding the left mouse button.
</p>

</li>
<li>
<i>Define the inert zone: set distant atoms to <b>inert</b>.</i>
<p>
We will now make the atoms that are too far from the active atoms
inert:</p>

<p class="indent_novspace">
<span class="menu">
MOE | RHS | Extend | Near Residues
</span>
</p>

<p>
This extends the selection to nearby residues: all atoms belonging
to residues which have at least one atom within 4.5&nbsp;&Aring;
of the currently selected atoms will be added to selection.</p>

<p class="indent_novspace">
<span class="menu">
MOE | RHS | Select | Invert
</span>
</p>
<p class="indent_novspace">
<span class="menu">
MOE | Edit | Potential | Inert
</span>
</p>

<p>
By inverting the selection, all atoms that are far away from the active
atoms (i.e. from the ligand and the P-loop) will be selected. Since these
atoms are distant from the active atoms they almost have no effect on
the calculations, and thus can be set to inert.</p>

<p>
To help identify the inert parts:</p>

<p class="indent_novspace">
<span class="menu">
MOE | Footer | Ribbon | <i>gray</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>As shown below, the flexible core includes the P-loop (red ribbon)
and the ligand, which are surrounded by the fixed atoms (orange), which,
in turn, are surrounded by inert atoms (gray).
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="lmmd_tut/lmmd_fig07_allsetup.png" alt="MOE-LMMD" />
</p>

</li>
<li>

<i>Limit the ligand's translational movements using tether forces.</i>
<p>
First clear the selection:</p>

<p class="indent_novspace">
<span class="menu">
MOE | RHS | Select | Clear
</span>
</p>

<p>Next select the ligand:</p>

<p class="indent_novspace">
<span class="menu">
MOE | RHS | Select | Ligand
</span>
</p>

<p>Then tether the ligand:</p>

<p>
<span class="menu">
MOE | RHS | Constrain | Tether
</span>
</p>

<p>This applies a tether constant of 10 kcal/mol&Aring;<sup>2</sup> on the
selected atoms.</p>

</li>

<p><li>Choose an appropriate forcefield potential for the simulation.
The current forcefield setting is shown to the left of the 
<span class="menu">MOE Footer</span>: </p>

<p align="center"><img src="moetour/ffsetting.png" 
alt="Current Forcefield" /></p>

<p>To change the forcefield, press the button showing the forcefield name in
the MOE Footer.</p>	

<ol>
<li>Click <b>Load...</b> and choose the <b>Amber12:EHT</b> Forcefield</li>
<li><b>Close</b> the Potential Setup panel</li>
</ol>

</li> 

<li>
<i>Run conformational analysis using the LowModeMD method.</i>

<p class="indent_novspace">
<span class="menu">
MOE |  Compute | Conformations | Search
</span>
</p>

<p>Change the <b>RMS Gradient</b> from
<tt>0.005</tt> to <tt>0.1</tt>.
This is to accelerate the calculation.
</p>

<p>Change the <b>Energy Window</b> from
<tt>7</tt> to <tt>100</tt>&nbsp;kcal/mol. The default
values are appropriate for small molecules; they should be increased for
larger structures such as the protein loop in this tutorial.
</p>

<p>Press <b>OK</b> to run the conformational search. The program first generates random
initial atomic velocities with kinetic energy concentrated on the low modes.
It then performs NVT dynamics for 0.5&nbsp;ps at 300&nbsp;K
followed by minimization of the system. The process is repeated to sample other minima.
</p>

<p>
Most other methods, including Kolossv&aacute;ry's low mode search (LMOD)
[Kolossv&aacute;ry&nbsp;1996][Kolossv&aacute;ry&nbsp;2001], use explicit
matrix diagonalization and compute the Hessian to find the low modes; this is
extremely slow (on the order of hours for proteins). LowModeMD in MOE
uses an efficient implicit method for estimating the low-frequency modes
which involves no diagonalization or formal mode
calculations. The method used is analogous to low band-pass frequency filtering,
except that here
we are dealing with velocities that we attenuate at high
range. A more detailed description is published [Labute&nbsp;2010].
</p>

<p>
As the LowModeMD calculation proceeds, the loop unfolding will be visible in
real-time. The most visible
characteristic of P-loop backbone unfolding is the Phe103
moving away from the ligand as shown below.
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="lmmd_tut/lmmd_fig08_finalresult.png" alt="MOE-LMMD" /></li></p>
<li>

<i>Stop the search.</i>
<p>
After about 10 conformations were created in the output
database, you can stop the search:</p>

<p class="indent_novspace">
<span class="menu">MOE | Cancel | Conformational Search</span>
</p>

</li>

</ol>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>This tutorial showcased the use of the LowMode
conformational search method for complex systems such as
protein loops, macrocycles, peptides, and small molecules.
When focusing on local changes, calculations
can be accelerated dramatically by fixing the position of neighboring atoms and
setting the distant atoms to inert.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b>
The conformational search panel in MOE allows
LowModeMD search as well as systematic and stochastic searches. The panel
accepts single molecules we well as databases as input. Shape descriptors are
printed in the output which can be useful for clustering generated
conformations of small molecules, peptides, and macrocycles.
