<p>MOE contains a suite of features for exploring protein-ligand interactions
and for manually constructing novel compounds in protein binding
sites. Novel compounds can be energy minimized inside the binding
site and ranked by binding free energy and affinity calculations. 
An automated procedure to prepare a protein-ligand structure is included, which 
adds hydrogens and sets protonation states, fixes receptor atoms far from the
ligand (so they are constrained not to move), and leaves receptor atoms
near the ligand (in the active site) free to move, though subject to 
<em>tether restraints</em> that discourage gross movement.
The ligand and solvent atoms can be either free to move or also subject to tethers.</p>

<h3>Abl kinase and imatinib</h3>

<p>Abl kinase is implicated in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Imatinib is a
known inhibitor of Abl kinase and is a highly successful
treatment for CML [Cortes 2007].</p>

<p class="cntr"><img src="ligx_tut/abl_kinase.png" alt="Abl kinase" />
<img src="ligx_tut/gleevec.png" alt="Imatinib structure" /></p>

<p>In this tutorial, we will load a co-crystallized structure of Abl
kinase protein bound to imatinib (PDB code 1IEP) into MOE, analyze the ligand 
binding mode and predict its affinity for the receptor. We will then
modify the ligand and calculate the properties and binding affinity
of the novel molecule.</p>

<ol>

<p><li>Load the co-crystal structure of Abl kinase protein bound to imatinib
(PDB code 1IEP) into MOE.</p>
<p><span class="menu">MOE | RHS | Open <tt>$MOE/sample/mol/1iep.pdb</tt></span></li></p>
<p><li>View the active site. The <span class="menu">MOE | RHS | SiteView</span> 
command will isolate all ligand molecules in the MOE Window, render the 
ligand atoms in <b>Stick</b> mode and the receptor in <b>Line</b> mode.</p>

<p>The 1IEP structure contains an Abl kinase dimer where both
binding sites are occupied by imatinib. We will have to choose one of
the imatinib molecules and surrounding binding sites to work with. For
this, first open the Sequence Editor (<span class="menu">MOE | SEQ</span> or
<span class="menu">MOE | Window | Sequence Editor</span>).</li></p>


<p><li>Select which molecule to operate upon.</p>
    <ol type="a">
    <li><p>Enable
	synchronized selection between the Sequence Editor
	and the MOE Window.</p>

    <p><span class="menu">SE | Select | Synchronize</span></p>
    </li>

    <li><p>Select the first STI residue appearing in chain 3 of the
    Sequence Editor.  With synchronized selection on,
    this results in the atoms of one of the imatinib molecules
    being selected, which can be seen in the MOE Window.
    Apply <b>Choose Ligand</b> to specify that subsequent operations are
    to be performed on this molecule.
    </p>

    <p><span class="menu">MOE | RHS | Ligand | Choose Ligand</span></p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Now visualize the selected ligand and binding pocket. 
    Deselect all atoms (either click in the main MOE window away from all 
    atoms, or choose <span class="menu">MOE | Select | Clear</span>.
    Then choose <span class="menu">MOE | RHS | SiteView</span> again.</p>

    <p>Notice that in the MOE Window, the ligand is displayed in <b>Stick</b> 
    mode, while all receptor residues with an atom within 4.5 &Aring; of the 
    ligand are displayed in <b>Line</b> mode. Proximal waters are
    shown in ball and stick rendering.</p>
    
    <p>To make it easier to differentiate the ligand and receptor, color the 
    receptor carbon atoms green.  Click on </p>
    
    <p><span class="menu">MOE | RHS | System</span></p>
    <p>Click on the gray box to the right of <tt>Receptor</tt>, and click on the 
    dark green box to apply that color scheme.</p>    
    <p class="cntr"><img src="ligx_tut/system.png" alt="MOE System panel for 1IEP" /></p>
	<p>Now disable Ribbon display using the System Manager by clicking on the icon for 
	ribbon mode and choosing the red button from the ribbon style popup menu.</p> 
    <p class="cntr"><img src="ligx_tut/sysman2.png" alt="MOE System panel for 1IEP" /></p>

    </li>
    </ol>

<p class="cntr"><img src="ligx_tut/choose_gleevec.png" alt="Imatinib bound to Abl" /></li></p>


<p><li>Often the ligand topology in PDB files is not correct (due to
coordinate errors and the lack of such information in PDB files). 
To ensure the structure of the ligand is correct, click</p>

<p><span class="menu">MOE | RHS | Ligand | 2D Molecules</span></p>

<p>This opens a 2D depiction which can be examined for errors.</p>

<p class="cntr"><img src="ligx_tut/gleevec_shot.png" alt="Imatinib 2D depiction" /></p>

<p>The hybridization and connectivity of this ligand are correct, though 
the protonation of the piperazine ring is incorrect. If the bond orders or 
connectivity of a ligand are incorrect then the 3D <b>Molecule Builder</b>
(<span class="menu">MOE | RHS | Builder</span>)
can be used to make corrections.  In this particular case, the incorrect 
protonation state will be corrected during the preparation of the structure. 
Close the window containing the 2D drawing of imatinib.</li></p>

<p><li>Choose an appropriate forcefield potential for the simulation.
The current forcefield setting is shown to the left of the 
<span class="menu">MOE Footer</span>: </p>

<p align="center"><img src="moetour/ffsetting.png" 
alt="Current Forcefield" /></p>

<p>To change the forcefield, press the button showing the forcefield name in
the MOE Footer.</p>	

<ol>
<li>Click <b>Load...</b> and choose the <b>Amber12:EHT</b> Forcefield</li>
<li><b>Close</b> the Potential Setup panel</li>
</ol>

</li> 

<li><p>Prepare the system.</p>

<p>Currently, the receptor and the waters have no hydrogens.  These
are needed for subsequent operations.</p>

<span class="menu">MOE | RHS | LigX</span>

<p>The LigX application prepares a PDB file for use in active site analysis 
and ligand modification.  The first step is correcting any problems with the 
structure using the <a href="../apps/structprep.htm">Structure Preparation</a> tool, 
then adding hydrogens and assigning 
protonation states, which is performed by default using the <a href="../apps/protonate3d.htm">Protonate3D</a> 
application. After this has completed, tethers are added to the receptor 
heavy atoms and distant atoms are fixed, and an energy minimization is performed. 
(You can fix the receptor or allow it to move freely by modifying the default 
options.)
</p>

<p>Press <b>OK</b> to initiate the calculations. The calculation will take a few
moments during which progress reports are written to the MOE Window.
The messages disappear when the calculation is done.</p>

<p>Verify the ligand bonding once again 
(<span class="menu">MOE | RHS | Ligand | 2D Molecules</span>). Notice that the 
Protonate 3D application has removed a hydrogen from the piperazine group of 
the imatinib molecule.</p>

<p class="cntr"><img src="ligx_tut/gleevec_shot2.png" alt="Protonated imatinib" /></li></p>


<p><li>Generate a 2D ligand interaction diagram for the Abl kinase-imatinib 
complex.</p>

<p><span class="menu">MOE | RHS | Ligand | Ligand Interactions</span></p>

<p class="cntr"><img src="ligx_tut/ligx_ints.png" alt="Imatinib ligand interaction diagram" /></p>

<p>Here you can see the ligand along with the nearby residues, with interactions 
marked. (See
<a href="../apps/prolig2d.htm">Ligand Interactions</a> for more
details on this diagram).  Note the interaction with threonine-315, mutation 
of which results in resistance to imatinib.
</li></p>

<p><li>Visualize hydrogen bonds in 3D</p>
<p>Hydrogen bonds are drawn in the main MOE window as dotted lines, with a bar 
in the middle that represents the strength of the interaction (the longer the 
bar, the stronger the interaction).  The display of contacts can be controlled 
from the <span class="menu">MOE | Footer | Contacts</span> panel.</p>
<p class="cntr"><img src="ligx_tut/contacts.png" alt="Control display of hydrogen bonds" /></p>
<p>Click on the button circled in red to cycle the labeling on the hydrogen bonds through 
the following modes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strength bar</li>
<li>Interaction energy (kcal/mol)</li>
<li>Distance</li>
<li>No label</li>
</ul>

<p>Other settings in the contacts panel control whether van der Waals clashes 
are displayed, the energy threshold required for a hydrogen bond or a vdW 
clash to be drawn, and the atoms for which contacts should be drawn.</li></p>

<p><li>Cycle through Hydrogen display modes:   </p> 
<p>
<span class="menu">MOE | RHS | Hydrogens</span>
</p>
<p>Selecting the ligand by double clicking will allow hydrogen     
toggling for the ligand only.</li></p>
<p><li>Visualize atom tethers</p>
<p>Click <span class="menu">MOE | RHS | Constrain | Render</span> to set the atom 
rendering style to allow easy identification of which are restrained by a tether and
which are unconstrained.  After clicking this, atoms that are neither fixed 
nor tethered are rendered in ball-and-stick mode; fixed or tethered atoms are 
rendered in line mode.</li></p>

<p><li>Find suitable substitution points on the ligand</p>

<p>To see where substitutions can be made on the ligand atoms, click on 
<span class="menu">MOE | RHS | Ligand | Ligand R-Vectors</span>. (If you see 
a message in the main MOE window indicating hidden vectors, repeatedly click 
<span class="menu">MOE | RHS | Hydrogens</span> until all hydrogen atoms are 
hidden, then click 
<span class="menu">MOE | RHS | Show | Ligand</span>.)  Note the arrows that 
are drawn from some ligand heavy atoms toward their hydrogens; these show the 
positions at which the heavy atom could be substituted with a methyl group without 
introducing more than a set amount of van der Waals clash energy (2 kcal/mol by 
default; this can be changed in 
<span class="menu">MOE | Settings cog | LigX</span>). To help 
visualize the pocket, draw a surface around the receptor atoms with 
<span class="menu">MOE | RHS | Surface | Interaction</span>. This surface is 
defined by the closest points a carbon atom can approach the receptor without 
incurring any vdW clash energy with it. Note that there 
is a single R-vector shown for the phenyl ring, and that this arrow points into 
a region of unoccupied space. Clear the surface with 
<span class="menu">MOE | RHS | Surface | Clear</span>.</p>

<p class="cntr"><img src="ligx_tut/ligx_rvectors.png" alt="A potential substitution point" /></li></p>

<p><li>Predict suitable substitutions</p>

<p>Launch the <b>Surfaces and Maps</b> panel using
<span class="menu">MOE | RHS | Surface | Surfaces and Maps</span>. 
From here we can calculate and display a number of surfaces and maps
to analyze the active site. We will calculate an
<b>Electrostatic Map</b> from the receptor atoms that will display
the preferred locations for hydrophobic entities as well as hydrogen
bond donors and acceptors.</p>

<p>Choose <span class="menu">Surface: Electrostatic Map</span>.  Press 
<b>Create</b>.</p>

<p class="cntr"><img src="ligx_tut/ligx_maps.png" alt="Surfaces and Maps panel" /></p>

<p>The Electrostatic Map displays a number of locations
where adding hydrophobic groups or hydrogen bond donors or acceptors
would be energetically favorable. Notice the region of hydrophobic preference 
that imatinib does not occupy (circled in red). We will be making a 
modification in this area to replace the existing 
hydrogen atom with a larger trifluoromethyl group that will better
occupy this region. Before we continue, we will clear the
Electrostatic Map. Press <b>Hide</b> in the <b>Surfaces and Maps</b>
panel and then <b>Close</b>.</p>

<p class="cntr"><img src="ligx_tut/gleevec_pb.png" alt="Electrostatic map" /></li></p>

<p><li>Display properties of the ligand.</p>

<span class="menu">MOE | RHS | Ligand | Ligand Properties</span>

<p>If we run a tethered energy minimization while the ligand properties
are displayed, the strain energy, MM/GBVI binding free energy (shown as 
"solvation") and affinity (predicted using the GBVI/WSA docking score) 
will be calculated and shown below the ligand properties.  Additionally, the 
score per ligand heavy atom is shown in brackets.</p>

<p><span class="menu">MOE | RHS | Minimize</span></p>

<p>Take note of the estimated affinity for imatinib of -15 kcal/mol and MM/GBVI
binding free energy of ~-77 kcal/mol.</li></p>

<p><li>Save the system.</p>

<p>Before
making modifications to the ligand, we will
save the current system. Open the <b>Save</b> dialogue:</p>

<span class="menu">MOE | File | Save</span>

<p>Save the system to a file called <tt>abl_imatinib.moe</tt>.</li></p>

<p><li>Modify the ligand.</p>

<p><span class="menu">MOE | RHS | Builder</span></p>

<p>This opens the Molecule Builder.
To add a trifluoromethyl group in place of the hydrogen atom identified
by the red circle in the image below, select the hydrogen atom and
press <b>C</b> in the Molecule Builder.</p>

<p class="cntr"><img src="ligx_tut/gleevec_build1.png" alt="Add trifluoromethyl to this hydrogen" /></p>
<p>Now, you see a newly added methyl group in place of the hydrogen atom.
Next, select the three new methyl hydrogens by holding down
the <tt>&lt;Shift&gt;</tt> key while selecting them in the MOE
Window,
then press <b>F</b> in the Molecule Builder to change the methyl group to a
trifluoromethyl group.</p>
<p class="cntr"><img src="ligx_tut/builder1.png" alt="The molecule builder" /></p>

<p>Now you are finished building the trifluoromethyl group.</li></p>

<p><li>Perform an energy minimization to relax any strain that may have been
introduced by the modifications made by clicking <b>Minimize</b> in the Molecule Builder.</p>

<p class="cntr"><img src="ligx_tut/gleevec_build3.png" alt="Modified imatinitb" /></p>

<p>
Note the improvements in the affinity and MM/GBVI binding free energy
values of this imatinib analogue. In experiments, this analogue has exhibited
binding energy gains greater than 2 kcal/mol [Asaki, T, 2006].

</li></p>

<p><li>Compute
the 2D Ligand Interaction Diagram for the new receptor-ligand complex.</p>

<p><span class="menu">MOE | RHS | Ligand | Ligand Interactions</span></p>

<p>Notice how the newly added trifluoromethyl group occupies the
hydrophobic pocket. If you do not see the new trifluoromethyl group
in the <b>Ligand Interactions</b> panel, press <b>Apply</b> to recompute
the ligand interaction diagram.</p>

<p class="cntr"><img src="ligx_tut/ligx_ints2.png" alt="" /></li></p>
