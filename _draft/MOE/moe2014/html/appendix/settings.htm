<p>Many aspects of the MOE interface can be configured and customized.
Many customizations are performed through the Settings menu,
<span class="menu">MOE | <img src="settings/settings.png"
alt="Settings" align="bottom" /></span>.
The settings are stored in
an RC (resource configuration) file, <tt>$HOME/.moe-rc</tt>.

<p><b>Note:</b>
The user resource configuration file is rewritten each time a MOE
session ends normally. Any changes made during the session are saved at
this time. This means that if you wish to edit your configuration file manually,
you must do so <b>after</b> closing MOE to
avoid losing any changes. Note that comments in a user configuration file
are not saved.</p>

<p>
The <img src="settings/settings.png" alt="Settings" align="bottom" />
menu is available in the
<b>MOE</b>, <b>Sequence Editor</b>, and <b>Database Viewer</b> window header
line. The three windows have different options in their
<img src="settings/settings.png" alt="Settings" align="bottom" /> menus:

The rendering style (<b>Solid</b>, <b>Line</b>, <b>Dot</b>),
material property, and coloring mode of &quot;Quick&quot; surfaces
(<b>Receptor Surface</b>, <b>Ligand Surface</b>, and
<b>Interaction Surface</b>) are set in the top part of the page.
The color widget is used for color selection when <b>Constant</b>
color is chosen.
Quick surfaces can be created via
<span class="menu">MOE | RHS | Surface</span> or the
<a href="../moe/gui/system.htm"><b>System Manager</b></a>.
<b>Protein</b> Quick surfaces use the same settings as <b>Receptor</b>
surfaces.
<br>
<b>Default Surface</b> defines the type of quick surface, which is
created by default in the System Manager for receptor atoms.
</p>

<p>
<b>R-Vector</b> specifies the van der Waals interaction
energy threshold and color used to draw
<a href="../apps/ligx.htm#RVectors">exit vectors</a>.

<a name="ProteinDefaults"></a> <h2>Protein Defaults</h2>

<div class="floatright">
<img src="settings/config_pro_defaults.png" width="395px" alt="Protein Defaults">
</div>
The <b>Protein Database</b> field specifies the default protein
molecular database used in the PDB and Domain Motif 
search application. Two protein databases with
data from the Protein Data Bank [Berman 2000] are delivered as part of the
MOE distribution. The file <tt>$MOE/lib/pdb.mdb</tt> is automatically
installed with MOE; it contains a non-redundant set of protein chains only.
An mdb containing the full release of the PDB is available separately.

<p>
The <b>Protein Family Files</b> field specifies a file with a list of 
sequence alignment files for homology searching.
See <a href="../proteins/pdb_mdb.htm">
Protein Sequence and Structure Data</a> for more information on MOE's
protein databases. 

<p>
The <b>Residue Database</b> is a molecular database file containing
conformational data on acetyl and amide endcaps, the 20 standard amino acids,
and more. This data is used by the Protein Builder and Create Sequence
applications and functions for constructing 3D polypeptide models in MOE.

<p>
The <b>Project Path</b> field specifies the default search path to be used
by the <a href="../proteins/projsrch.htm">Project Search</a> panel, as well
as for the <span class="menu">SE | Annotate | Sequence</span> and
<span class="menu">SE | Alignment | Constraints | Automatic</span> menus. It is also used to
populate the <span class="menu">MOE | Protein | Search</span> and
<span class="menu">SE | Protein | Search</span> menus.
<br clear="both" />
</p>

<p>
The <b>Rotamer Library</b> is used by multiple
applications. The Rotamer Library is used to defined the standard library
residues in <a href="../apps/structprep.htm">Structure Preparation</a>,
and the rotamers and amino acids available for rotamer exploration in the
<a href="../apps/prodesign.htm">Protein Design</a>,
<a href="../proteins/probuild.htm">Protein Builder</a> and the
<a href="../proteins/promodel.htm">Homology Modeler</a>. Multiple
libraries can be specified in a semicolon separated list.

<p>
The <b>Loop Library</b> is used by the
<a href="../apps/proloop.htm#LoopSearch">Loop Modeler</a> application. It is
also used for the loop building stage of the 
<a href="../proteins/promodel.htm">Homology Modeler</a>.
Multiple libraries can be specified in a semicolon separated list.

<p>
Click the <b>Validate</b> button to validate both the <b>Rotamer Library</b>
and <b>Loop Library</b> specified above the button.
</p>

<p><b>Render Protein</b> is used to enable or disable the highlighting of key
structural features when reading from PDB or mmCIF files. 
For more information, see <a href="../proteins/pdb_mdb.htm#RenderProtein">
Rendering PDB and CIF files</a>.

<a name="PSILO"></a><h2>PSILO/RCSB Connectivity</h2>
</p>

<div class="floatright">
<img src="settings/psilo.png" alt="PSILO Options">
</div>
<p>
MOE can connect to the RCSB with no special configuring, although
configuration options do exist.
Connecting to PSILO requires setting the PSILO URL and the user
name and password.
</p>

<p>
If you have access to a
<a href="http://www.chemcomp.com/PSILO-Protein_Structure_Database_System.htm" target="_blank">PSILO</a>
server, you can configure MOE to connect to it, for example using the
<a href="../moe/gui/fileopen.htm">Open</a> panel.

<p>
Enter the required information, then press <b>OK</b> or <b>Apply</b>.
<b>PSILO Name</b> is just an arbitrary name for the connection.
</p>


<p>
Connecting to the RCSB requires no username or password.
By default, MOE will connect to the main RCSB site
<tt>http://www.rcsb.org</tt>, as maintained by the
<a href="http://www.wwpdb.org">World Wide Protein Data Bank</a>
consortium.  However, a mirror site can be specified by
entering the appropriate URL in the <b>RCSB Mirror</b> field and pressing
<b>OK</b> or <b>Apply</b>.
Note that the RCSB page of the Open panel requires an http address
supporting the RCSB RESTful web service in order to load index data.
However, MOE can download files from mirrors of the RCSB ftp site, or from
any http address that will serve RCSB-style file URLs, i.e.
<span class="nobr">&quot;<tt>/pdb/files/{code}.ent.gz</tt>&quot;.</span>
</p>

<p>
<span class="tip">Tip</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;The RCSB Mirror must be set
to a proper mirror site and not an ftp site (e.g.
<tt>ftp://ftp.wwpdb.org</tt> is not a valid mirror site).
</p>

</p>
<b>Note:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
If your network uses an internet proxy server, you may
need to configure the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) for HTTP
transfers through the proxy server.  For more information,
please see the section on
<a href="../install/install.htm#JVM_OPTS">Options for
Starting the JVM</a>.

<a name="JDBC"><h2>Java/JDBC Database</h2>


<div class="floatright">
<img src="settings/jdbc.png" width="450px" alt="JDBC Options">
</div>

<p>
The <b>Java Executable</b> text field sets the path of the Java Executable 
that is used by MOE. By default, MOE will look for Java in the
<a href="../install/install.htm#SVL_JVM">Java Environment Variables</a> section,
and will display it here if found. However, if Java is not found, or a different
version is preferred, this field can be used to modify the default setting.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="samples.htm#JDBCViewer">JDBC Database Viewer</a> and other
applications that use the JDBC relational database access library generally
require server and user specification.
</p>

<p>Up to four connection configurations may be specified. </p>

<p>The fields and commands in this window are as follows:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Alias</b>.
String used for the <b>Database Alias</b> option menu in the JDBC Database
Viewer.  If no alias is given, then the URL itself will be used in the menu.
</li>

<li><b>URL</b>.
The URL specifying the database to which to connect.  This
is a JDBC URL that begins with the protocol string <tt>jdbc:</tt>.  The
specific form of this URL will be defined in the documentation of the JDBC
driver used.
</li>

<li><b>Driver</b>.
The JDBC driver class file to be used to communicate with the database server.
Refer to the documentation of the JDBC driver used for the exact string to
enter.
</li>

<li><b>Username</b>.
The user account to use when connecting to the database server.
</li>

<li><b>Password</b>.
Defines the password to use when logging-in to the database server.  This must
be either the <tt>mpu_</tt> encoded password for the given <b>Username</b> or
the non-encoded password.
If the non-encoded password is entered, then <tt>mpu_password[]</tt>
will be run on the text when <tt>Return</tt> is pressed.  If the desired
password is an empty string, press <tt>Return</tt> in the
textfield when the textfield is blank.
A pre-encoded password can be pasted into this field.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<b>Validate Connection</b> calls <tt>jdbc_open</tt> with the
currently displayed values to determine if the data allows for a
valid connection to be established. To clear each entry in the form,
press <b>Clear Form</b>.
<b>OK</b> or <b>Apply</b> must be pressed before the changes will take
effect.

<p>
The <b>Default Server</b> in the <a href="../install/web_inst.htm">MOE/web</a>
configuration panel shows the name of the default MOE/web server, located at the
<b>Server Domain</b> address and listening to <b>Port</b>. The color of the 
<b>Default Server</b> field indicates the server status: if the server is up and
running, the name will be in green; if not, it will be in red.

<p>
The button <b>Test Server</b> will contact MOE/web to validate its state.
If server responds correctly, a green check sign is displayed to the left of
the button, otherwise a red cross sign is shown. For <i>localhost</i>, a browse page
icon will also be shown to the left of the test button. It can be
clicked to open the MOE/Web page in a web browser.

<p>
New MOE/web servers can be added by clicking <b>Add Server</b>.

<p>
The following section allows controlling a local MOE/web instance. The
<b>Local Server</b> textfield shows the address of the local MOE/web instance,
normally <i>localhost.localdomain</i>.

<p>
The buttons <b>Start Server</b> and <b>Stop Server</b> control the state of
the local MOE/web instance while the <b>Test Server</b> validate the connection.

<a name="DatabaseViewer"></a><h2>Database Viewer</h2>

<div class="floatright">
<img src="settings/dbv.png" alt="Database Viewer">
</div>

The <b>Default Plot Range</b> values specify the default range of vertical
axis values of the Database Viewer plot area.
<p>
The <b>Modifier</b> fields contain SVL commands to execute when the
left mouse is double-clicked in any cell of the database viewer.
<b>None</b> means a plain double click, <b>Control</b> means a double-click
with the Ctrl key held down and similarly for <b>Shift</b> and <b>Alt</b>.

<p><b>Row Color</b> sets the color of alternate rows in the Database Viewer.

<p><b>Show popup menu shortcut markers</b>, when selected, will cause a
popup menu to appear in the cell the mouse currently points to:
<img src="settings/dbv_popup.png" alt="popup" />.  Clicking on the triangle
brings up the same menu as a right-click in the cell. 
<br clear="both" />
</p>


<a name="MainMouse"></a><h2>Mouse (MOE Window)</h2>


<div class="floatright">
<img src="settings/mouse2.png" alt="Mouse Configuration" />
</div>
<p>
MOE allows the user to completely reconfigure the mouse behavior
in the MOE main 3D window. This is useful, if e.g. only a two button
mouse is available or the user is accustomed to a specific mouse mapping.
To change the mouse configuration, select the mouse event
to change (e.g. <b>Left Button Drag</b>, <b>Right Button Click</b>, etc.)
and then choose the action from the pulldown list which MOE should perform
in case of released mouse events. To unset an action select the empty line on
the bottom of the pulldown list. If the chosen action is not the default
action for this mouse event a red exclamation will appear beside it,
and the bubble help for the exclamation mark
will describe the default action for this mouse event.
At the top of the panel the <b>Modifier Key</b> can be selected for the
mouse events to be configured. A <b>Status</b> line at the bottom of the
panel summarizes the number of changes and additions with respect to the
MOE default mouse configuration.
</p>

<p>
SVL commands can also be assigned
to mouse single click and double click events. When <b>Execute SVL Command</b>
is selected in the pulldown list a <b>Set</b> button will appear on the
event line. It opens a popup with a text field, in which the SVL expression to
execute can be entered. To assign the expression the
<b><tt>Enter</tt></b> key must be pressed. In this expression, the
<tt>$</tt> character is replaced by the atom key of the clicked
atom (or zero if no atom is clicked).
For example, to toggle the label setting of selected atoms using the
shift right mouse button in the MOE Window, you would enter the
following SVL expression in the <b>Shift + Right Button Click</b> text field:

<pre>
if $ then aSetLabelName[$, not aLabelName $]; endif
</pre>
</p>
<p>
The <b>Sensitivity</b> controls the sensitivity of
rotation and translation as a function of mouse movements.
Higher values provide more precise
control in the rendering area than lower values. The sensitivity is a
floating-point number with default value of 250; this value provides fine
control without significant loss of speed.
Values ranging from 100 to 1000 produce good results.
<p><b>Buttons</b> is used to specify the number of mouse buttons.  Normally
the default <i>Auto Detect</i> will work correctly.  When a 2-button mouse
is detected or selected, the functions of the middle button are mapped to the
right mouse button.  In this case, the Alt key may be used to access popup
menus.
<p>
<p>
The mouse configuration changes are applied right away (Note
that the changes will be written to the user <tt>moe-rc</tt> file when MOE
is closed). To discard the changes and return to the settings when the
Mouse Configuration panel was opened, press <b>Undo Changes</b>. If you
want to return the default mouse configuration of MOE, press <b>MOE Default</b>.
<br>
<b>Note!</b> Returning to the <b>MOE Default</b> configuration will still
retain any <b>Execute SVL Command</b> mouse actions that do not interfere with
the default mapping. To remove such actions as well, each of them have to
be unset explicitly in the panel.
</p>

<br clear="both" />



<a name="FKeys"><h2>Function Keys</h2> </a>

<div class="floatright">
<img src="settings/fkeys.png" alt="Function Keys">
</div>
<p>
MOE normally does not make use of the F1-F11 keyboard function keys.  However,
these may be programmed to invoke SVL expressions.  To configure these keys
enter the expression to be associated with the function key, or
the <b>Ctrl</b>+, <b>Alt</b>+ or <b>Shift</b>+ modified function key.
Press <b>OK</b> or <b>Apply</b> (the latter leaves the panel open).
The function key configuration will be written to the
MOE configuration file.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b>
On some operating systems, certain function key combinations
have been appropriated by the system for keyboard shortcuts and cannot
be overridden by the Configuration Options panel.
For example, Alt+F4 is commonly used to exit programs and on GNOME,
Alt+F7 is used to move the focused window.

<p>
<b>Bubble Help Mode</b> controls the display of bubble help in all
MOE panels. To enable the display of bubble help, select <b>on</b>.
To disable the display of bubble help, select <b>off</b>.
Select <b>key</b> to display bubble help only when
the <tt>Ctrl</tt> key is held down for over a second.
</p>

<p>
<b>SVL Output History</b> controls the number of text lines to maintain in the
scrolling area of the SVL Commands window.
<b>SVL Command History</b> controls  the number of previous commands to keep
in the command line (CLI) history buffer. Previous commands are retrieved
at the CLI with the up/down arrow keys.
</p>

<p>
The <b>Warning Beep</b> checkbox determines whether or not the operating system will
produce a sound when a warning or error panel is produced within MOE. Note that on
Linux and Mac OS X systems, the sound may not be produced regardless of this
setting, due to its dependence on the installed implementation of X11.
</p>

<p>
The <b>Start In Folder</b> text field sets the initial working directory for MOE.
The "." character (dot) sets the initial working directory to
the directory from which MOE was launched. 
The "~" character (tilde) sets the initial working directory to your home
directory. In addition to the dot and tilde 
characters, you can enter any file path here.
</p>

<p>
The MOE installer will set <b>File Associations</b> for several file
formats to the MOE applications on Microsoft Windows, so that these
files can be opened directly in MOE from the Desktop or File Explorer with a
simple double click. These associations can also be set or unset from
within MOE with the <b>File&nbsp;Associations:&nbsp;Setup</b> popup: Select
the file types to be associated to MOE and press <b>Set</b>. Unselected file
types will get disassociated from MOE. If a new extension that is not part of
the default extensions should be associated to MOE, the functionality to add a new
extension can be accessed by clicking the <b>Add New...</b> button in the
<b>File&nbsp;Associations:&nbsp;Setup</b> popup.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note!</b> The selection
state upon opening the popup reflects the current file association
state. Checked and unchecked extensions reflect set and unset extensions,
respectively, while a red extension signifies that the extension is not associated with the
current version of MOE.
</p>

<p>
The MOE installer will also create a desktop shortcut to MOE on Microsoft Windows, if desired.
The ability to create additional desktop shortcuts is available from within MOE by
using the <b>Desktop Shortcut: Create</b> popup. Existing shortcuts can be updated using
this panel.

<p>
The <b>Window Positions</b> buttons allow to:
<ul>
    <li><b>Save</b>: Saves the position of all named windows in MOE.
    <li><b>Restore</b>: Moves all windows to their saved positions.
    <li><b>Reset</b>: Reset stored positions to default values.
</ul>
<p>
MOE now has enhanced support for multi-monitor setup:
</p><p>
One can specify whether the monitor assignment of windows
should be stored and restored the next time they are opened.
The <b>Multi-Monitor</b> dropdown list defines which monitor
will be used when new windows are opened:
<ul>
<li><b>Primary monitor.</b> As defined by the operating system.
<li><b>MOE.</b> The monitor in which the MOE Main Window resides.
<li><b>Mouse.</b> The monitor in which the mouse is currently located.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
On Microsoft Windows, the behavior of the MOE <b>Input Focus</b>
(i.e. which window receives the keyboard input) can be configured.
If <b>Focus follows mouse</b> is enabled, the window under the mouse
will be automatically activated without the need of a mouse click. This
mode is common on Unix systems. The option <b>Click on title to raise windows</b>
controls whether clicking anywhere into a MOE panel or just on its title bar
activates and raises it. Selecting <b>Activate windows on show</b>
will make sure that newly opened application windows will get activated
and have the input focus. For this option to have an effect <b>Focus
follows mouse</b> must be deactivated.
