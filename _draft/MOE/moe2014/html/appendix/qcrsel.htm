The QuaSAR-Reagent application is used to estimate the activity of R-groups
and <i>scaffold</i> (also called <i>central</i>) 
molecules in a virtual combinatorial
library.  By assigning an activity score to each such building block, a
pure combinatorial design can be achieved by using this activity information
first to cluster the <span class="nobr">R-groups</span> and 
scaffold molecules and then to select the
best candidates.  The virtual library is constructed by functionalizing
scaffold molecules.  QuaSAR-Reagent estimates the activity information
by statistical sampling of the "chemical space" spanned by all possible
R-group/scaffold substitutions.

</p>


<a name="Theory"></a>
<h2>Theory and Formulation</h2>

<p>
QuaSAR-Reagent is able to search diverse subsets from extremely large
virtual libraries for one simple reason: <i>the virtual library is never
enumerated</i>.  In conventional techniques, one first enumerates the
library by forming all combinations of scaffolds and R-groups followed
by activity evaluation.  QuaSAR-Reagent uses sampling techniques for
each of the sub-calculations thereby avoiding the enumeration.

<p>
The Basic Sampling Operation is used to select a random member of the
virtual library spanned by the scaffold and <span class="nobr">R-group</span>
databases.  
The Basic Sampling Operation proceeds as follows:

<ol>
<li>Randomly select a scaffold molecule.
<li>Randomly select R-group molecules.
<li>Construct the product.
<li>Test against Rule of Five Filter; i.e. if any of Molecular Weight,
LogP, Number of donors+acceptors, Number of rotatable bonds falls outside
pre-set limits then return to step 1 (a maximum of 1000 times).
</ol>

<p>
Imagine counting the number of times that a given R-group or scaffold
group molecule <i>m</i> appears in a biologically active compound.  We
can express this count as:

<span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{align}
A\left( m \right) = \sum_{k} \delta \left( \textrm{k is active} \right)
    \delta \left( m \in k \right)
\end{align}
</span>

<P>
where the sum extends over all compounds <I>k</I> in the virtual library.  The
assessment of activity used is a Binary QSAR model, which outputs
the probability that a compound is active.  We therefore can replace the
activity assessment with a softer (probabilistic) one:

<span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{align}
A\left( m \right) = \sum_{k} \textrm{Pr} \left( \textrm{k is active} \right)
    \delta \left( m \in k \right)
\end{align}
</span>

<P>
To avoid enumerating the library, we replace the summation with a Monte Carlo
integration as follows.  We assume a uniform sampling of the virtual library
and sample <I>p</I> molecules.  This gives:</P>

<span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{align}
A\left( m \right) \approx
    \frac{1}{p} \sum_{i=1}^{p} \textrm{Pr} \left( X_{i} \textrm{ is active} \right)
    \delta \left( m \in X_{i} \right) \frac{1}{1 / V}
\end{align}
</span>

<P>
where <I>V</I> is the number of compounds in the virtual library 
and <i>X<sub>i</sub></i> is 
the <i>i</i><sup>th</sup> of <i>p</i> sampled molecules.  To avoid
explicit use of the number of compounds in the virtual library, we can
normalize the count by dividing by the total number of active compounds in
the virtual library:</P>

<span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{align}
P\left( m \right)
    =
    \frac{
        \frac{1}{p} \sum_{i=1}^{p}
            \textrm{Pr}\left( X_{i} \textrm{ is active} \right)
            \delta \left( m \in X_{i} \right)
            \frac{1}{1 / V}
    }{
        \frac{1}{p} \sum_{i=1}^{p}
            \textrm{Pr}\left( X_{i} \textrm{ is active} \right)
            \frac{1}{1 / V}
    }
    =
    \frac{
        \sum_{i=1}^{p}
            \textrm{Pr}\left( X_{i} \textrm{ is active} \right)
            \delta \left( m \in \bar{X}_{i} \right)
    }{
        \sum_{i=1}^{p}
        \textrm{Pr}\left( X_{i} \textrm{ is active} \right)
    }
\end{align}
</span>

<P>
This approximate value to <I>P</I>(<I>m</I>) is what is written as output
for each source database R-group or central group.

<h2>Running QuaSAR-Reagent</h2>

<p>

To open the QuaSAR-Reagent panel choose
<span class="menu">MOE | Compute | QuaSAR | QuaSAR-Reagent</span>
in the MOE Window.
The panel is operated in the style of a "Wizard"; that is, a sequence
of pages that specify the parameters to the calculation.  The <b>Next</b> and
<b>Previous</b> buttons are used to move between the pages. The <b>Start</b>
button becomes available on the last page and is used to start the calculation.
The <b>Cancel</b> button can be used at any time to terminate the calculation.

<p>
<b>Page 1: Virtual Library Definition</b>.  The first page contains fields
used to specify the virtual library:

<p>
<center><img src="qcrsel/reagent.png" alt="Reagent Library"></center>

<p>

The filenames of the databases used in a QuaSAR-Reagent run are shown on this
page, and can be specified using the <b>Define and Edit Connections</b> button. 
QuaSAR-Reagent generates new compounds by randomly functionalizing scaffold
molecules from the <b>Scaffold</b> database with R-groups from databases
specified in the <b>Connections</b>.  Functionalizations occur between terminal
atoms named "Ax" (where x is an integer from 0 to 9) on the scaffold molecules
and terminal atoms named "A0" ("A" zero) on the R-groups. The overall
functionalization "reaction" is:

</p>

<center> Scaffold-Ax + A0-R  ->  Scaffold-R ;   x = 0 to 9</center>

<p>
In bidentate connections, a second connection is made from the scaffold
to a terminal atom named "A1" in an R-group.  Connections are specified by 
pressing the <b>Define and Edit Connections</b> button.

<p>
Scaffold structures are created by renaming the atoms at the desired
points of substitution with the tokens A0 to A9. Each scaffold molecule must
contain at least one atom named "Ax" to be recognized as a valid scaffold
by QuaSAR-Reagent.  Symmetric substitutions are achieved by giving
multiple atoms the same name.  Bidentate substitutions are also supported,
as are substitutions through higher-order bonds.  Bidentate connections
are specified when defining or editing a connection in the
<b>Edit Connections</b> panel.
Naming non-terminal atoms "Ax" can result in errors and unreasonable
structures.

</p>

<p>
R-groups are created by renaming the atom at the desired point of
substitution with "A0". R-groups must contain one and only one "A0" atom to
be correctly recognized by QuaSAR-Reagent. R-groups may also contain a
terminal atom labeled A1, in which case the group can be used in a bidentate
connection.  If the group has other atoms labeled "Ax" (x is not 0 or 1),
then these can be used as substitution points in subsequent invocations
of QuaSAR-CombiDesign.  In this way you can set up a multi-step "reaction".
You may label a multiply-bonded atom with "A0" or "A1", in which case the
substitution will be made through a higher-order bond.  Naming non-terminal
atoms "A0" will result in errors and unreasonable structures.

</p>

<p>
For more information about scaffolds, R-groups, and specifying
connections, please
see the chapter on <a href="cdgen.htm">QuaSAR-CombiGen</a>.

<p>

The filenames of the output databases are also specified in this first
page.  The output database for the scaffold molecules is specified in
the <b>Scaffold Output Database</b> text field.  The names of the R-group
output databases will be the same as the R-group source databases,
prefixed by the <b>R-Group Name Prefix</b>.

<p>
<b>Page 2: Rule of Five Filter</b>.  Virtual Library compounds are constructed
by randomly choosing a scaffold molecule and functionalizing it with random
R-groups.  The Rule of Five Page is used to reject virtual library members
with a collection of filters:

<p>
<center><img src="qcrsel/pg_rule.png" alt="Rule of 5"></center>

<p>
A constructed virtual library member will only be used if its Molecular
Weight, LogP (octanol/water), number of donors + acceptors and number
of rotatable
bonds fall between the limits specified in the Rule of Five Filter page.
If any one of the tests fail then the constructed molecule is rejected
and another is randomly chosen.

<p>
<b>Page 3: Model</b>.  The biological activity of sampled virtual
library molecules are evaluated with a model.  The model can be of
various types: <a href="../quasar/model.htm">linear and binary QSAR</a>,
<a href="../apps/ph4_guide.htm">pharmacophore</a>,
<a href="../mdb/fpmodel.htm">fingerprint</a>,
and <a href="../quasar/modcomp.htm">composite (MOE model)</a>.

<p>
<center><img src="qcrsel/pg_model.png" alt="Model"></center>

<p> The Model page allows for the specification of the model and the duration
of the calculation.  An optional reference database can also be specified.
This reference database must contain compounds and activity data.
The specified model is evaluated over the database, and, from the model
accuracy, coefficients C<sub>0</sub> and C<sub>1</sub>, used to weight
subsequent model predictions, are calculated.  The weighted predictions
and not the original values are then used by QuaSAR-Reagent
calculations as follows:

<span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{align}
p_{reagent} = C_{0} + C_{1} * p_{model}
\end{align}
</span>

<p>
A previously saved model filename must be entered in the
<b>Model File</b> text field.  The
<b>Iterations</b> count controls the number of samples used in the
calculation.  If <i>k</i> is entered for <b>Iterations</b>, then the number
of iterations is <i>km</i> where <i>m</i> is the number of molecules
in the largest source database.

<p>The optional reference database is specified in the <b>Reference</b>
text field.  Generally, this database must contain molecular data.
The database must also contain a numeric <b>Activity Field</b>.
At least one of the <b>Lower Threshold</b> and <b>Upper Threshold</b>
must be specified.  Checkboxes are used to enable or disable the
use of the individual thresholds.
The thresholds are applied to the activity data to determine which
entries in the reference database are to be deemed active.  If the
lower threshold is specified, an entry will be considered active only if
its activity value is greater than or equal to the threshold value.
If the upper threshold is specified, the entry will be considered active
only if its activity value is less than the threshold value.
If both thresholds are specified, the entry is considered active only
if its activity value satisfies both upper and lower threshold requirements.

<p>
<b>Page 4: Start Simulation</b>.  This is the final page of QuaSAR-Reagent.
The <b>Start</b> button must be pressed to begin the calculation.

<p>If MOE/cluster (MOE/smp) is enabled, the calculation will be distributed over
the available host machines.


<a name="Output"></a>
<h2>QuaSAR-Reagent Output</h2>

<p>

QuaSAR-Reagent outputs to both the CLI and to the output database.  CLI
output echoes the process which QuaSAR-Reagent is currently performing, and
can be used to monitor the progress of the calculation.  The QuaSAR-Reagent
run options are first output as a tagged vector, followed by a summary of
the Scaffold and R-group databases.  At the end of the run, the names of
the output databases are echoed, and an estimate is given of the number
of actives present in the virtual combinatorial library.

<p>

The database output consists of a copy of each input database used in
the calculation along with a new field in each one with the name '$ACT'.
This field contains an estimate of the proportion of active compounds
in the entire virtual library that contain the corresponding component.
That is, the '$ACT' field numbers will sum to 1 in any given database,
with higher numbers indicating that a higher proportion of active compounds
contain that R-group or scaffold group.
