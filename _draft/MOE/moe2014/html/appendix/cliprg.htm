<p>This page describes the Clip R-Groups panel and explains how to
select invalid R-Group entries in a database.
Clip R-Groups has been superseded in MOE by the
the <a href="../apps/combitools.htm">Combinatorial Library</a>

<h2><a name="ClipRGroups">Clipping R-Groups</a></h2>

<p>The Clip R-Groups panel is used to prepare an R-group database for 
combinatorial library compound design, e.g. 
<a href="qcombi.htm">QuaSAR-CombiDesign</a>.
(See also <a href="cdgen.htm">QuaSAR-CombiGen</a>,
Enumerative Combinatorial Library Compound Generator.)  To open the panel,
use <span class="menu">DBV | Compute | CombiChem | Clip R-Groups</span>
in a Database Viewer.

<h3><a name="ClippingEnvironments">Clipping Environments</a></h3>


<img src="cliprg/clipenv.png" class="floatright" 
alt="Clipping Environment Specification">

<p>MOE runs through a source database of molecules and searches for compounds
that contain a specified <i>environment</i> or functional group of atoms.
This search is done by matching on the environment match string selected
in the Clip R-Groups panel.

<p>The environment specifies the context in which the atoms to be
clipped/marked for attachment must be found -- for example, the carbonyl
oxygen in the carboxyl group of a carboxylic acid.  Only within the specified
environment will atoms be operated upon.  If a particular leaving group is
also found outside the specified environment, those instances of the group
will not be clipped.  Note, however, that in the 
<a href="#Options">Clip Whole Group</a> mode, 
atoms outside the environment may also be clipped.

<p>Once the environment is found, MOE either clips off the specified <i>leaving
group</i> and writes the remaining fragment back to the database, or marks
the specified atoms as attachment points, depending on the clipping mode.

<p>The leaving group must be singly-connected (through one bond only) to
the main molecule.


<h3><a name="ClippingModes">Clipping Modes and Marker Atoms</a></h3>

<p>The Clip R-Groups panel has three modes of operation:

<p><center><img src="cliprg/clipmode.png" alt="Clip Modes"></center>

<dir>
<table border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing=5>
<tr>
<td width="20%" VALIGN="TOP"><b>Leaving Groups</b>
<td width="90%" VALIGN="TOP">
Specify a leaving group to be clipped off the
main molecule; the group is clipped and the atom at the clip
point is marked as a point of attachment

<p><img src="cliprg/leaving.png" alt="Leaving Groups">
</tr>

<tr>
<td VALIGN="TOP"><b>Additions</b>
<td VALIGN="TOP">
Specify a "terminals" group; the first and last
atoms in this group will be marked as points of attachment
in addition reactions

<p><img src="cliprg/connect.png" alt="Additions">

</tr>

<tr>
<td VALIGN="TOP"><b>Rings</b>
<td VALIGN="TOP">
Specify a leaving group that includes atoms belonging to a ring; part of
that ring will be clipped away, and the atoms at the clip points
marked as points of attachment

<p><img src="cliprg/rings.png" alt="Rings">

</tr>
</table>
</dir>

<p><img src="cliprg/atomname.png" class="floatright" alt="Atom Name Buttons">

<p>In all cases, Clip R-Groups marks an atom as a point of attachment by
attaching to it a <i>marker atom</i> with a special name of the form "Ax",
where x is a digit.  The <b>Atom Name</b> buttons are used to specify the
name of the marker atom.

<p>In the case of Additions and Rings, two points of attachment are possible. 
The first and last atoms in each of the expressions in the Terminals and
Leaving Group fields will be marked as Atom 1 and Atom 2, respectively.  You
can choose to mark only one atom as an attachment point by setting the name of
the other atom to H.

<p>Marker atoms must not be given names that already exist in the molecule.
If an atom with the same name as a marker atom is found in a given
molecule, no clipping will be done on that molecule.

<h3><a name="Options">Options</a></h3>
<p>
When performing clipping, the following options are available:

<ul>

<li><b>Clip All Groups.</b>  When this option is enabled, if multiple
matches of the environment are found, clipping operations will be performed
on <i>all</i> the matches.  If the option is disabled, then if multiple
matches of the environment are found, two results are possible: if all
environments are found to be equivalent (symmetric), then an arbitrary one
will be clipped and the rest untouched; if the environments are found to
be not all equivalent, then no clipping is done.

<p>
<li><b>Preserve Bond Order.</b>  This option, when enabled, results in
the bond order at the clip point being preserved; i.e.
the bond order at the attachment point will be the same as that
prior to clipping.  When this option is disabled, marker atoms
are connected to the main molecule through single bonds.

<p>

<li><b>Extend Leaving Group.</b> Turning this option on allows more atoms
than just those specified in the leaving group string to be clipped.
An attempt will be made to clip both leaving group and atoms attached to
the leaving group.

<p>
<b>Note:</b> For this to work properly, all heavy neighbors of the root of
the leaving group must be specified in the leaving group molecule string.
This is needed to disambiguate the connection to the main molecule as
the bond to the main molecule is specified implicitly .

<p>When the option is off, only the atoms explicitly specified in the
leaving group will be clipped.  If any other atoms are attached to
the leaving group, no clipping will be done (these other atoms will be
considered as belonging to the main molecule, in which case the leaving
group is no longer singly-connected to the main molecule).

<p>
<li><b>Remove H's from Clipped Atoms.</b>  If the option is enabled,
all hydrogens atoms (except marker atoms) will be stripped from the atoms
from which a leaving group has been clipped or which have been marked as
attachment points.  If the option is off, hydrogens will be preserved.

</ul>

<h3><a name="RunningClipRGroups">Running Clip R-Groups</a></h3>
<p>

<ol>

<p><li>In a Database Viewer loaded with the database on which you want
to do the clipping, choose <nobr><b>DBV | Compute | CombiChem | Clip R-Groups
</nobr></b>.

<p><center><img src="cliprg/clip.png" alt="Clip R-Groups Panel"></center>

<p><li>Specify the source molecule field using the <b>Source Field</b>
option menu.  The molecules in this field will be clipped.

<p><li>Specify the <b>Destination Field</b> into which the clipped molecules
will be written.  If you wish to write into a new field, turn on <b>Other</b>
and type the molecule field name in the <b>Specify</b> text field.  If you
select a field that already exists, that field will be overwritten.

<p><li>Choose the appropriate <b>Clip Mode</b>, and set the clipping options.

<p><li>In the listbox, select the appropriate environment and group.

<p><li>Choose the name of the marker atom or atoms.

<p><li>Press <b>Apply</b>.  The panel will stay up so that you can do
successive iterations of clipping.

<p><font color="#ff0000"><b>Tip</b></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;

If a molecule already contains an atom of the same name as the one you have
specified for a marker atom, the molecule will not be clipped.  This means
that you can use the same destination field for a subsequent clipping
operation without losing the results from the previous operation.

<h2><a name="SelectInvalid"></a>Selecting Invalid R-Group Entries</h2>

<p>After running Clip R-Groups, some entries may not have been
successfully clipped so that they do not contain an attachment point
atom identified by the special name "Ax", where x is a digit. 
A molecule may be missing an attachment point atom because it did not,
for instance, contain the functional group used in the clipping operation.
To identify these cases, place the mouse over the destination field header,
and choose 
<p class="indent_novspace">
<span class="menu">DBV | Field Popup | Select Entries | Bad A[k]</span>
<p>
to select these entries.
</p>

<p>The molecular data in the field where the popup
was issued are examined to see if they contain exactly one occurrence
of the specified terminal atom (<b>A0</b>, ..., <b>A9</b>).
Entries whose data fail this test are
flagged as being invalid by being added to the entry
selection set.

<h2><a name="Adding"></a>Adding or Modifying the List of Leaving Groups</h2>

<p>To add R-groups and leaving groups to the Clip R-Groups panel,
you will need to modify the SVL file
<tt>$MOE/lib/svl/run/dbvclip.svl</tt>. Copy this file into the
directory from which you run MOE, then edit it.

<p>The <a href="../moe/molsystems/smiles.htm">SMILES matches</a> for the
functional groups and leaving groups are
specified in <tt>dbvclip.svl</tt>.  There are three kinds of specifications,
depending on the clipping mode -- monodentate leaving group, ring
(bidentate) leaving group, or additions.  For example, for a monodentate
leaving group, the functional group and leaving group specifications are
in a table as follows:

<p>
<pre>
const GROUPS = tr [
    [   '[#G7]C(=O)[#6]',       '[#G7]',        'Acid Halide'           ],
    [   '[OH][CX4]',            'O',            'Alcohol'               ],
    [   '[OH]c',                'O',            'Aromatic Alcohol'      ],
    [   '[CH](=O)[#6]',         '[#1]',         'Aldehyde'              ],
    [   '[#G7][CX4]',           '[#G7]',        'Alkyl Halide'          ],
    [   '[CH]#C',               '[#1]',         'Alkynide'              ],
    [   '[#G7]c',               '[#G7]',        'Aryl Halide'           ],
    [   '[#G7]CC=C',            '[#G7]',        'Allylic Halide'        ],
    [   '[NH2X3][CX4]',         '[#1]',         'Alkyl Amine (Primary)' ],
    [   '[NH2X3]c',             '[#1]',         'Aryl Amine (Primary)'  ],
    [   '[NHX3]([CX4])[CX4]',   '[#1]',         'Alkyl Amine (Secondary)'],
    [	'[OQ1]C=O',		'O',		'Carboxylic Acid O'	],
    [	'[CX3](=O)[OQ1]',	'C(=O)O',	'Carboxylic Acid'	],
    [   'O(C)C(=O)',            '[OQ2][CX4]',   'Alkyl Ester'           ],
    [   'O(c)C(=O)',            '[OQ2]c',       'Aryl Ester'            ],
    [   '[BrQ1]',               'Br',           'Halogen (Bromine)'     ],
    [   '[ClQ1]',               'Cl',           'Halogen (Chlorine)'    ],
    [   '[FQ1]',                'F',            'Halogen (Fluorine)'    ],
    [   '[IQ1]',                'I',            'Halogen (Iodine)'      ],
    [   '[SH][CX4]',            '[#1]',         'Alkyl Thiol'           ],
    [	'O=[CX3]',		'O',		'Carbonyl O'		],
    [	'[CQ2]([#G7])=C',	'[CQ2][#G7]',	'Alkenyl Halide'	]
];
</pre>

<p>Each entry in the <tt>GROUPS</tt> table is organized as follows:

<pre>
    ['functional group SMILES', 'leaving group SMILES', 'name']
</pre>


<p>The SMILES expression <tt>'functional group SMILES'</tt> must uniquely
match the functional group.  For example, <tt>[OH]</tt> would be a poor
choice for specifying alcohols because it is not sufficiently specific --
it would also match the hydroxyl group of carboxylic acids, for instance.
A better match string would be <tt>[OH][CX4]</tt>, which specifies an O
attached to a tetrahedrally-coordinated (i.e. sp3) carbon atom.

<p>The leaving group must be specified at the beginning of the functional
group SMILES string, with the clip atom (i.e. the atom in the clip
fragment that is connected to the remainder of the molecule) as the root
(first atom).  For example, <tt>[OH][CX4]</tt> is appropriate for
specifying the functional group of alcohol if <tt>'O'</tt> is the atom to
be clipped.  Conversely, <tt>[CX4][OH]</tt> would fail (no clipping done)
if O is the leaving group because O is not at the beginning of the SMILES
expression.

<p>
The <tt>'leaving group SMILES'</tt> must also have the clip atom specified
as the root of the SMILES expression.  All atoms that are in the clip
fragment must be specified in the leaving group SMILES string.

<p>For example, consider clipping the alcohol
portion off an ester:

<ul>
<li>Functional group <tt>'O(C)C(=O)'</tt> defines the ester functionality.
O, the root atom, is the clip atom.

<li>Leaving group <tt>'[OQ2][CX4]'</tt>
defines the fragment to be clipped.  O is the clip atom, and will be
clipped along with the sp3 C connected to it.

</ul>

<p>The line you see in the <tt>GROUPS</tt> vector is:

<pre>
    [   'O(C)C(=O)',	'[OQ2][CX4]',	'Alkyl Ester' ],
</pre> 

<p>Now consider the following line, suitable for adding to <tt>GROUPS</tt>:

<pre>
    [   '[H1][O][Cx4]',	'[H1]',		'alcohol-hydroxyl-H' ],
</pre>

<p>This line specifies the clipping of the hydroxyl H of an alcohol.

<p>Note that the leaving group string obeys molecule string
<a href="../moe/molsystems/smiles.htm">match syntax</a> rules.
Thus, for example, you can specify that atom neighbors <i>not</i>
be in a given group:

<pre>
    N[#Q!$(CC=O)]
</pre>

<p>This string will match N with a heavy neighbor that is not
the root of the group <tt>CC=O</tt>.  Similarly,

<pre>
    N([!$(CC=O)])[!$(CC=O)]
</pre>

<p>will match a nitrogen that has two neighbors, neither of which matches
<tt>CC=O</tt>.  This would match both NH2 and N(C)C, for instance.

<p>The ring clipping specifications are done similarly to those for leaving
groups, except that the leaving group is bidentate.  Once again, the first
atom in the functional group must also be a clip atom.  In the leaving
group SMILES expression, the first and last atoms are both clip atoms,
and must be part of the same ring.

<p>For example, in the <tt>RINGS</tt> table, this is the specification for
alpha-pyrone:

<pre>
    [	'C1(=O)OC=CC=C1',	'C(=O)O',	'2-pyrone'	]
</pre> 

<p>Here, the ester portion of the cyclic ester is marked for
clipping.

<p>In addition reactions, no clipping is done.  Instead, atoms
with higher order bonds are marked as points of addition.
Specifications are made with entries in the <tt>ADDITIONS</tt> table,
and are of the form

<pre>
    ['functional group SMILES', 'terminals group SMILES', 'name']
</pre>

<p>Similarly to the other two kinds of specification, the first atom in
the functional group must be one of the atoms that is to be marked as a
point of addition.  Similarly to rings, the first and last atoms of
the terminals group must be the points of addition.
