<h2>Formulation and Theory</h2>

<p>The purpose of <span class="nobr">QuaSAR-Model</span> is to determine optimal parameters for the
prediction of molecular properties such as biological activity against a
particular target or physical properties such as logP and refractivity.</p>

<p>Suppose that we are given <i>m</i> molecules each of which is described
by an <i>n</i>-vector of real numbers
<span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{equation}
x_{i} = \left( x_{i1}, ..., x_{iN} \right),
\end{equation}
</span>
consisting of the descriptors for molecule <span class='LaTeX'>\(i\)</span>.
Let <span class='LaTeX'>\(y_{i}\)</span>
be an experimental result for molecule <span class='LaTeX'>\(i\)</span>
(e.g. biological activity, logP or refractivity).  Further,
suppose that each molecule has an associated importance weight,
<span class='LaTeX'>\(w_{i}\)</span>, a non-negative real number.  These weights can be
thought of as the relative probability that the associated molecule will
be encountered and are usually all equal to 1; however, in some
applications, unequal weights are used.  Let <span class='LaTeX'>\(W\)</span> denote the sum of
all the weights.</p>

<p>
<a name="Linear_Model"></a>
<h3>Linear Model</h3>

A linear model for <span class='LaTeX'>\(y\)</span> takes the
form <span class='LaTeX'>\(a_{0} + a^{T} x\)</span>
where <span class='LaTeX'>\(a_{0}\)</span> is
a scalar and <span class='LaTeX'>\(a\)</span> is an
<span class='LaTeX'>\(n\)</span>-vector.  These parameters are chosen so
that they minimize the <i>mean square error </i>
(<span class='LaTeX'>\(MSE\)</span>) function</p>

<span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{equation}
MSE\left(a_{0},a\right) = \frac{1}{W} \sum_{i=1}^{m} w_{i} \left[
        y_{i} - \left( a_{0} + a^{T} x_{i} \right)
    \right]^2
\end{equation}
</span>

<p>By differentiating MSE with respect to the parameters, it can be shown that
the parameters must satisfy the following equations called the <i>normal
equations</i>:</p>

<span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{equation}
a_{0} = y_{0} - a^{T} x_{0},
\hspace{20pt}
    S a = b = \frac{1}{W} \sum_{i=1}^{m} w_{i} y_{i} \left( x_{i} - x_{0} \right)
\\
y_{0} = \frac{1}{W} \sum_{i=1}^{m} w_{i} y_{i},
\hspace{10pt}
    x_{0} = \frac{1}{W} \sum_{i=1}^{m} w_{i} x_{i},
\hspace{10pt}
    S = \frac{1}{W} \sum_{i=1}^{m} w_{i} \left( x_{i} - x_{0} \right) \left( x_{i} - x_{0} \right)^{T}
\end{equation}
</span>


<p>Care must be taken in solving these equations since
<span class='LaTeX'>\(S\)</span> is often
singular or close to singular.  The normal equations are solved using matrix
diagonalization.  Since <span class='LaTeX'>\(S\)</span>
is symmetric and positive semi-definite, all
of its eigenvalues are real and non-negative.  We can therefore calculate an
orthogonal matrix <span class='LaTeX'>\(Q\)</span> and a diagonal matrix
<span class='LaTeX'>\(D\)</span> such that
<span class='LaTeX'>\(S=Q^{T} D Q\)</span>
and such that the diagonal elements of <span class='LaTeX'>\(D\)</span>
are sorted in descending order.  We take the first <span class='LaTeX'>\(p\)</span>
eigenvalues such that all are positive and the condition (the largest of the
<span class='LaTeX'>\(p\)</span> eigenvalues divided by the smallest of the
<span class='LaTeX'>\(p\)</span> eigenvalues) is
less than some pre-set threshold.
The pseudo-inverse diagonal matrix
<span class='LaTeX'>\(D^{*}\)</span> is then formed with the inverse of the selected
<span class='LaTeX'>\(p\)</span> eigenvalues on the diagonal and zero elsewhere.
Finally, we determine the parameter vector <span class='LaTeX'>\(a\)</span> with
<span class='LaTeX'>\(a = Q^{T} D^{*} Q b\)</span>.
This methodology is called 
principal components regression (PCR).
</p>

<p>
As an alternative to PCR, one may wish to determine the parameters of the
linear model by the method of partial least squares (PLS). In general,
this will yield slightly different estimates which may be more robust
[Geladi 1986].  Setting up the normal
equations as above, we again seek an estimate of
<span class='LaTeX'>\(a\)</span> when <span class='LaTeX'>\(S\)</span> is
possibly ill-conditioned. One way to proceed is to construct a weight matrix
<span class='LaTeX'>\(V_{A} = \left( v_{1}, v_{2}, \ldots, v_{A} \right)\)</span>,

where the <span class='LaTeX'>\(v_{i}\)</span> are column vectors of length
<span class='LaTeX'>\(n\)</span>,
and <span class='LaTeX'>\(A\)</span>, the degree of the PLS fit, is an integer less than or
equal to <span class='LaTeX'>\(n\)</span>. We first
obtain the columns of <span class='LaTeX'>\(V_{A}\)</span>
through a Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization
of the vectors generated by the Krylov sequence
<span class='LaTeX'>\(\left\{ b, S b, S^2 b, \ldots, S^{A-1} b \right\}\)</span>.
Then, to get the <span class='LaTeX'>\(A^{th}\)</span>
PLS coefficient vector, we solve for

<span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{equation}
a = V_{A} \left( V_{A}^{T} S V_{A} \right)^{-1} V_{A}^{T} b
\end{equation}
</span>

<p>
[Helland 1988].
An algorithm to determine successive PLS fits will
terminate at the <span class='LaTeX'>\(A^{th}\)</span> step when
<span class="nobr"><span class='LaTeX'>\(\left\|v_{A+1}\right\|\) = 0</span></span>.
One may, however, wish to use an even lower order PLS regression vector
to fit the linear model.
Note that if the algorithm continues until <span class='LaTeX'>\(A = n\)</span>,
the weight matrix is
square and of full rank.
The resulting regression vector is simply the ordinary least squares
solution equivalent to solving
<span class="nobr"><span class='LaTeX'>\(a = S^{-1} b\)</span></span>.
</p>

<p>The fitting procedures for both PCR and PLS have the
following parameters:</p>

<ul>
<li><tt>maxcomp</tt> : The maximum number of components. In PCR, this is
the maximum that <span class='LaTeX'>\(p\)</span> can attain, and in PLS, this is the maximum that
<span class='LaTeX'>\(A\)</span> can attain.

</li>

<li><tt>maxcond</tt> : For PCR, this is the maximum condition of the
inverse of the selected <span class='LaTeX'>\(p\)</span> eigenvalues. For PLS, this means that
<span class='LaTeX'>\(A\)</span> takes on (at most) the number of nonzero eigenvalues of
<span class='LaTeX'>\(S\)</span>.
 </li>

</ul>

<p>The results of the fit are presented as the <i>root mean square error</i>
(RMSE) which is the square root of the MSE function at the chosen parameter
values and the <span class='LaTeX'>\(r^{2}\)</span> correlation coefficient which is equal
to 1-MSE/YVAR where YVAR is the sample variance of the <span class='LaTeX'>\(y_{i}\)</span>
values.  The <span class='LaTeX'>\(r^{2}\)</span> lies between 0 and 1, with 1 corresponding
to an ideal fit.</p>



<p>
<a name="Binary_Methodology"></a>
<h3>Binary Methodology</h3>

Suppose that the <span class='LaTeX'>\(y_{i}\)</span> data
are <i>binary</i>, that is, either 0 or 1.  This situation corresponds,
for example, to a High Throughput Screening run in which the result for each
molecule is either &quot;active&quot; (1) or &quot;inactive&quot; (0).  Note
that continuous activity data can be made binary using a threshold criterion
(e.g. <span class='LaTeX'>\(y_{i} > 5\)</span>).  In the text which follows,
<span class='LaTeX'>\(Y\)</span>
denotes a random variable with value 0 or 1 and
<span class='LaTeX'>\(X = \left( X_{1}, \ldots, X_{n} \right)\)</span>
denotes a random variable over <span class='LaTeX'>\(n\)</span>-vectors
(a random molecular descriptor).</p>

<p>Our fundamental method uses the conditional distribution
<span class='LaTeX'>\(Pr\left(Y\left|X\right.\right)\)</span>
in order to determine the probability that a new
molecule <span class='LaTeX'>\(x\)</span> is active with
<span class='LaTeX'>\(Pr\left(Y=1\left|X=x\right.\right)\)</span>. Let
<span class='LaTeX'>\(a\)</span>
denote the prior probability <span class='LaTeX'>\(Pr\left(Y=1\right)\)</span>
and define
<span class='LaTeX'>\(f\left(x,y\right) = Pr\left(X=x\left|Y=y\right.\right)\)</span>.
We can now use Bayes Theorem and write:</p>

<span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{equation}
p\left(x\right)
    = Pr\left( Y = 1 \left| X = x \right. \right)
    = \frac{ f\left(x,1\right) a }{ f\left(x,1\right) a + f\left(x,0\right)\left(1 - a\right) }
\end{equation}
</span>

<p>and upon rearranging we have:</p>

<span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{equation}
p\left(x\right) = \left[
        1 + \frac{ f\left(x,0\right) }{ f\left(x,1\right) } \frac{1-a}{a}
    \right]^{-1}
\end{equation}
</span>

<p>Without loss of generality we can assume that each descriptor has mean 0
and variance 1.  Suppose that the individual molecular descriptors,
<span class='LaTeX'>\(X_{i}\)</span>, are mutually independent.  In this case we have:</p>

<span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{equation}
p\left(x\right) = \left[
        1 + \frac{1-a}{a} \prod_{j=1}^{n} \frac{ f_{j}\left(x_{j},0\right) }{ f_{j}\left(x_{j},1\right) }
    \right]^{-1}
\end{equation}
</span>

<p>where <span class='LaTeX'>\(f_{j}\left(x,y\right) = Pr\left(X_{j}=x\left|Y=y\right.\right)\)</span>.
Thus, we must estimate distributions of the form
<span class='LaTeX'>\(Pr \left( X_{j} = x \left| Y = y \right. \right)\)</span>
and the prior probability <span class='LaTeX'>\(a\)</span>.</p>

<p>The random variable, <span class='LaTeX'>\(Y\)</span>,
takes on the values 0 or 1.  Now, the
maximum likelihood estimate for <span class='LaTeX'>\(a\)</span> is
<span class='LaTeX'>\(S/m\)</span> where
<span class='LaTeX'>\(S = y_{1} + \ldots + y_{m}\)</span>.
This is an unbiased
estimate with the smallest possible variance over all unbiased estimators. However,
for small sample sizes, or samples in which a single value is observed, it is
possible to have an estimate of <span class='LaTeX'>\(a=0\)</span>.
This can be catastrophic for the
above formulae which require likelihood ratios.  For this reason, we use the
biased Bayes estimate under a uniform prior which is
<span class='LaTeX'>\(a = \left( S+1 \right)/ \left( m+2 \right)\)</span>,
and is always in <span class='LaTeX'>\(\left(0,1\right)\)</span> and well
defined when <span class='LaTeX'>\(m\)</span> is zero.
Let <span class='LaTeX'>\(m_{1}\)</span> be the number of
active molecules in the data set and let the number of inactive
molecules be denoted
<span class='LaTeX'>\(m_{0} = m - m_{1}\)</span>.  We now have:</p>

<span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{equation}
p\left(x\right) \approx \left[
    1 +
        \frac{m_{0} + 1}{m_{1} + 1}
        \prod_{j=1}^{n}
        \frac{f_{j}\left(x_{j},0\right)}{f_{j}\left(x_{j},1\right)}
\right]^{-1}
\end{equation}
</span>

<p>Let
<span class='LaTeX'>\(z_{1},\ldots,z_{m}\)</span> be
<span class='LaTeX'>\(m\)</span> samples of a
continuous random variable <span class='LaTeX'>\(Z\)</span>.
We can estimate <span class='LaTeX'>\(f\)</span> by
accumulating a histogram of observed sample values on a set of
<span class='LaTeX'>\(B\)</span> bins
<span class='LaTeX'>\(\left( b_{0},b_{1} \right], \ldots, \left( b_{B}-1,b_{B} \right]\)</span>
defined by <span class='LaTeX'>\(B+1\)</span>
numbers <span class='LaTeX'>\(b_{j} < b_{j}+1\)</span>,
with <span class='LaTeX'>\(b_{0}\)</span> equal to minus infinity and
<span class='LaTeX'>\(b_{B}\)</span>
equal to plus infinity.  The usual procedure for counting the number of
observations among <span class='LaTeX'>\(m\)</span> samples in bin
<span class='LaTeX'>\(j>0\)</span> is:</p>

<span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{equation}
B_{j}
    = \sum_{j=1}^{m} \delta \left( z_{i} \in \left( b_{j-1},b_{j} \right] \right)
    = \sum_{i=1}^{m} \int_{b_{j-1}}^{b_{j}} \delta \left( x - z_{i} \right) dx
\end{equation}
</span>

<p>which has unfortunate sensitivity to the selection of bin boundaries since
observations close to the boundary between two bins are treated as if they
were in the middle of one of the bins.  To reduce the sensitivity to the bin
boundaries we replace the delta function observation density with a normal
random variable with mean
<span class='LaTeX'>\(z_{i}\)</span> with variance
<span class='LaTeX'>\(s^2\)</span>. We now have:</p>

<span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{equation}
B_{j}
    =   \sum_{i=1}^{m}
        \int_{b_{j-1}}^{b_{j}}
        \frac{1}{s \sqrt{2\pi}}
        \exp{\left[ - \frac{1}{2} \frac{\left( x - z_{i} \right)^2}{s^2} \right]}
        dx
    =   \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{m} \left[
              \textrm{erf}{\left( \frac{b_{j}   - z_{i}}{s \sqrt{2}} \right)}
            - \textrm{erf}{\left( \frac{b_{j-1} - z_{i}}{s \sqrt{2}} \right)}
    \right]
\end{equation}
</span>

<p>We can thus model each of the descriptor distributions
<span class='LaTeX'>\(f_{j}\left(x,y\right)\)</span>
for <span class='LaTeX'>\(y\)</span> equal to 0 and 1 and for
the <span class='LaTeX'>\(n\)</span> descriptors;
that is, for each descriptor, we estimate two
distributions: one for the active molecules in the training set and one for
the inactive molecules.</p>

<p>The above considerations suggest the following computational procedure:</p>

<ol>
<li>
Perform a principal component analysis on the input descriptors to produce a
matrix <span class='LaTeX'>\(Q\)</span>
and a vector <span class='LaTeX'>\(u\)</span> such that the covariance matrix of
<span class='LaTeX'>\(Z=Q\left(X-u\right)\)</span>
is the identity matrix.</li>
<li>
Estimate the parameters of the probability model, <span class='LaTeX'>\(p\)</span>, from the
<span class='LaTeX'>\(y_{i}\)</span> and <span class='LaTeX'>\(z_{i}\)</span>.
</li>
<li>
The probability that a new molecule <span class='LaTeX'>\(x\)</span>
is active is then estimated as
<span class='LaTeX'>\(p\left(Q\left(x-u\right)\right)\)</span>.
</li>
</ol>

<p>The procedure has the following parameters (explained in the foregoing
equations):

<ul>
<li><tt>maxcomp</tt> : maximum number of components
<li><tt>maxcond</tt> : maximum condition of the <span class='LaTeX'>\(Q^{T}Q\)</span> transform
<li><tt>swidth</tt> : normal histogram smoothing width <span class='LaTeX'>\(s\)</span>
</ul>


<a name="Run"></a>
<h2>Running QuaSAR-Model</h2>


<p>In the Database Viewer, choose
<span class="nobr"><b>DBV | Compute | Model | QSAR</b></span>.  
Since the command was
launched from a Molecular Database Viewer, the database to be operated
upon is specified implicitly.  The following panel appears:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="model/model.png" ></p>

<p>The panel controls have the following meanings:</p>

<ul>
<b><p><li>Database</b>.  Specifies the filename of the database to be
operated upon (the <i>current</i> database).</li></p>

<b><p><li>Selected Entries Only.</b>  If checked, and a Molecular Database
Viewer is open on the current database, then the calculations will be
restricted to entries (rows) that have been selected in the Molecular
Database Viewer.</li></p>

<b><p><li>Status</b>.  The Status line indicates the state of the 
<span class="nobr">QuaSAR-Model</span> 
panel.  A value of &quot;No Model&quot; indicates that there is no current
model.  A value of &quot;Binary Model:...&quot; or &quot;Linear Model:...&quot;
indicates that a model has been fitted.  Other values may appear during the
calculations.</li></p>

<b><p><li>Activity Field</b>. The database field containing the data to be 
fitted (the <i>y</i> values in the theory section).</li></p>

<b><p><li>Method</b>.  Choice of three regression methods: PLS, PCR, Binary.
If Binary is chosen then the Activity Field together with the
Binary Threshold value are used to derive a binary value to be fit
(see below) and the binary methodology is used.  If PLS or PCR is
chosen, then the multiple linear regression methodology is used.</li></p>

<b><p><li>Weight Field</b>. The name of the field used to weight
individual entries of the database. These weights should be non-negative;
negative weights will be set to zero for the calculation. If the Weight Field
is set to (NONE), then all entries will have a weight of 1.</li></p>

<b><p><li>Component Limit</b>. In the case of PCR, this sets a limit on the 
number of principal
components selected. A value of zero means that no limit is set; otherwise, at
most the specified number of largest principal components will be used.
In the case of PLS, this sets a limit on the degree of the fit. A value of 
zero means that no limit is set; otherwise, at most the specified degree 
will be used. </li></p>

<b><p><li>Condition Limit</b>. For both PCR and PLS, this sets the maximum 
condition 
(see theory
section) number of the principal component transform of the 
correlation matrix S. When the PLS option is selected,
one may wish to set this limit to be very large and vary 
only the component limit.</li></p>

<b><p><li>Binary Threshold</b>.  If Binary is checked, then the binary activity
condition is created from the Activity Field and the Binary Threshold as
follows.  If <i>x</i> is the Activity Value and <i>t</i> is the value of
Binary Threshold, then an entry's binary activity is considered 1 if <i>x</i>
&gt; <i>t</i> and 0 otherwise.</li></p>

<b><p><li>Smooth</b>. This field controls the width of the smoothing
distribution used in accumulating the distributions during clustering. It is
the standard deviation of a normal distribution (the <i>s</i> value in the
theory section). This field is used only if Binary is checked.</li></p>

<b><p><li>Model</b>.  This list serves two purposes.  First, it specifies
which fields in the database are to be used as descriptors.  Second, it
displays the resulting coefficients of linear regression models (see below).
If no fields are selected in the list, then all fields will be used (with the
exception of the Activity Field, Weight Field and fields created during model
validation).  If fields are selected, then the selected fields will be used in
the fit (with the exception of the Activity Field).</li></p>

<p><li><b>Sort by Normalized</b>.  If checked, then the fields in the Model list
box will be sorted by their normalized coefficient (see below).</li></p>

<p><li><b>Sort by Name</b>.  If checked, then the fields in the Model list box
will be sorted by their name.  If Sort by Normalized is also checked then the
normalized coefficient is used as the primary key and the field name as the
secondary key.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Select Database Fields</b>.  When pressed, the descriptors
currently selected in the list will have their respective fields
in the database viewer selected.  If the specified database is not
currently open in a database viewer then this button is insensitive.

</ul>

<p>The <b>Fit</b> button is used to fit the parameters of the requested model.
The <b>Report</b> button generates a text report once a model has been
calculated.  The <b>Validate</b> button is used to create new fields in the
database such as model predictions, cross-validated predictions and residuals.
The <b>Save</b> button is used to save calculated models to disk for
subsequent evaluation.  The <b>Close</b> button closes the panel.</p>

<p>Once a model has been created and saved to a file using
<b>Save</b>, it can be evaluated over a database of molecules using 
<span class="menu">DBV | Compute | Model
| <a href="modcomp.htm">Evaluate</a></span>.

<a name="Fit"></a><h2>Estimating Model Parameters</h2>

<p>
To estimate the parameters for a model, press the <b>Fit</b> button in the
main <span class="nobr">QuaSAR-Model</span> panel.  This will start the parameter estimation calculation,
which may take some time.  The Status line will indicate whether or not the
calculation has completed.

<p>
Once a model has been built, the status line will report the type of model
(either Linear or Binary) along with an assessment of model quality:

<ul>
<li><tt>R2=</tt><i>r<sup>2</sup></i>: correlation coefficient (linear models)
<li><tt>RMSE=</tt><i>e</i>: root mean square error (linear models)
<li><tt>A=</tt><i>a</i>: percentage accuracy (binary models)
<li><tt>A0=</tt><i>b</i>: percentage accuracy of the inactive subset
(binary models)
<li><tt>A1=</tt><i>c</i>: percentage accuracy of the active subset
(binary models)
</ul>

<p>
If a linear regression model was built, the descriptor coefficients will be
displayed in the Model listbox of the <span class="nobr">QuaSAR-Model</span> panel.  Two sets of
coefficients are displayed: the actual coefficient and the <i>normalized</i>
coefficient (the coefficient in a model where all fields have been normalized
to mean 0 and variance 1).

<p>
To generate a report of the fit, press the <b>Report</b> button.  For linear
regression models, the report will contain a number of sections.  The first
section contains the values of the input parameters: activity field, 
weight field, condition and component limits, followed by the dimensions of the
calculation along with the condition number of the principal component
transform.  The model quality (and cross-validation statistics) will also be
listed:

<blockquote><pre>Activity Field               : act 
Weight Field                 : 
Condition Limit              : 1e+06 
Component Limit              : 4

Observations                 : 285
Descriptors                  : 9
Components Used              : 4
Condition Number             : 25.756166

ROOT MEAN SQUARE ERROR (RMSE): 1.91449     
CORRELATION COEFFICIENT (R2) : 0.37208     
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Two listings of the calculated model will be presented.  The first is a
list of coefficients and the additive constant of the model.  The second
lists the coefficients of the normalized model.

Finally, a statement of the relative importance of the descriptors is
presented.  The absolute values of the normalized coefficients are printed,
divided by the absolute value of the largest normalized coefficient.

For a binary model, the report starts with similar statistics and a statement
of the accuracy of the model. <b>Total Accuracy</b> is the 
fraction of observations
correctly predicted by the QSAR model, while <b>Accuracy on Active</b> 
and <b>Accuracy on Inactive</b> are the fractions
of correctly predicted sample actives and inactives, respectively. 
One might ask what these accuracies
would be if there was no correlation between the model and the sample. 
We shall call these quantities "Chance" accuracies. Now we are in a 
position to assess the significance of the results. 

Denote the actual number of agreements and disagreements between the model 
and the sample by <span class='LaTeX'>\(n_{1}\)</span>
and <span class='LaTeX'>\(n_{0}\)</span>,
respectively. Then, denote the number of agreements and disagreements 
that one would get if the model results
were uncorrelated with the sample, by
<span class='LaTeX'>\(e_{1}\)</span> and <span class='LaTeX'>\(e_{0}\)</span>,
respectively. As the sample size
becomes large, the Chi-square statistic

<span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{equation}
\chi^2 =
      \frac{ \left( n_{0} - e_{0} \right)^2 }{e_{0}}
    + \frac{ \left( n_{1} - e_{1} \right)^2 }{e_{1}}
\end{equation}
</span>

takes on a Chi-square distribution with one degree of freedom.
The associated probability, called a p-value, is interpreted as the 
likelihood of observing a result "at least this extreme", under
the assumption that the model is doing no better than pure chance.
The smaller the p-value, the less likely that the total accuracy 
is simply luck.

By only considering "agreement" and "disagreement", 
we are not discriminating between accuracy 
in the actives and accuracy in the inactives. 
To incorporate this information, we 
again use a Chi-square test, but now with greater degrees of freedom. Denoting
the number of agreements in the actives by
<span class='LaTeX'>\(n_{1}\)</span>, the number
of disagreements in the actives by
<span class='LaTeX'>\(n_{2}\)</span>, the number of
agreements in the inactives by <span class='LaTeX'>\(n_{3}\)</span>,
and the number of disagreements in the inactives by
<span class='LaTeX'>\(n_{4}\)</span>,
we can then contrast
these observed frequencies with the numbers that one would obtain if there 
was no correlation
between the model and the sample. Denote these values by 
<span class='LaTeX'>\(e_{1}\)</span>
through <span class='LaTeX'>\(e_{4}\)</span>.
The Chi-square statistic

<span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{equation}
\chi^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{4} \frac{\left( n_{i} - e_{i} \right)^2}{e_{i}}
\end{equation}
</span>

also takes on a Chi-square distribution, but now with three degrees of freedom.
The p-value quoted under 
<b>Accuracy on Actives/Inactives</b> is the probability that <i>both</i> 
these accuracies would 
differ from the "chance accuracy" as much as they do, 
if the actives and inactives
in the QSAR model are uncorrelated with those in the sample.
Note that the former method is a coarser test and will be less likely to
detect differences from chance.


<p>
Since the binary methodology is highly non-linear, there is no simple
analogue of the descriptor coefficient or relative importance.  The binary
report will contain a correlation coefficient for each principal component
indicating whether or not the active and inactive distributions are
correlated (0 = perfectly correlated, 1 = perfectly uncorrelated).  The
RMSE refers to the expected root mean square error between the active
and inactive distributions.  Finally, a statement of descriptor importance
is presented giving the degree to which (between 0 and 1) each descriptor
is useful in distinguishing actives from inactives.

In both of the linear model and binary model cases, the report will be
written to a MOE Text Editor.

<a name="Valid"></a><h2>Validating a Model</h2>

<p>
To start validating a model, press the <b>Validate</b> button in the main
<span class="nobr">QuaSAR-Model</span> panel.  This will bring up the following panel:

<p>
<center><img src="model/validate.png" /></center>

<p>
Any one of six values can be selected for calculation using the checkboxes.
The validation fields are:

<p>
<center><table class="titlebar">
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Field&nbsp;Name</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr><tr>
<td>Model&nbsp;Prediction</td>
<td><tt>$PRED</tt></td>
<td>Value of the model</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Model&nbsp;Residual</td>
<td><tt>$RES</tt></td>
<td>Difference between the value of the model and the activity field</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Model&nbsp;Z-Score</td>
<td><tt>$Z-SCORE</tt></td>
<td>Absolute difference between the value of the model and the activity
field, divided by the square root of the mean square error of the data set</td>

</tr><tr>
<td>Cross&nbsp;Prediction</td>
<td><tt>$XPRED</tt></td>
<td>Value of the model under a leave-one-out cross validation scheme</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Cross&nbsp;Residual</td>
<td><tt>$XRES</tt></td>
<td>Difference between the value of the model under a leave-one-out cross
validation scheme and the activity field</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Cross&nbsp;Z-Score</td>
<td><tt>$XZ-SCORE</tt></td>
<td>Absolute difference between the value of the model under a
leave-one-out cross validation scheme and the activity field, divided by
the square root of the mean square error of the data set</td>
</tr>
</table></center>

<p>
The two Z-Score fields <tt>$Z-SCORE</tt> and <tt>$XZ-SCORE</tt> can be thought
of as &quot;the number of standard deviations away from the mean&quot; and should be
used for outlier detection.  Using the Molecular Database Viewer plot area,
select all molecules with a Z-Score of 2.5 or more.  This subset should then
be examined carefully for errors, or to determine new descriptors to calculate.

<p>
If any of the cross-validation fields are selected, then the Status Line of the
main <span class="nobr">QuaSAR-Model</span> panel will contain cross-validated versions of the
correlation coefficient (<span class='LaTeX'>\(r^2\)</span>) and root mean square error; also, a
report generated after cross-validation will contain the cross-validation
results as well.
