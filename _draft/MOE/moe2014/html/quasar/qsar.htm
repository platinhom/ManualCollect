<p>
The QuaSAR suite of applications in MOE is used to analyze experimental data
and build numerical models of the data for prediction and interpretation
purposes.</p>

<p>
Suppose that experimental results for <i>m</i> molecules have been obtained.
For purposes of notation, let <i>y<sub>i</sub></i> denote the experimental
result for molecule <i>i</i> and <i>m<sub>i</sub></i> denote molecule <i>i</i>.
This collection is referred to as the <i>data set</i> or <i>training set</i>,
for example:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
If the <i>y<sub>i</sub></i> are IC<sub>50</sub> values representing the
biological activity of a ligand, then one would build a numerical model from
the training set in order to predict IC<sub>50</sub> of molecules not in the
training set.

<li>
If the <i>y<sub>i</sub></i> are High Throughput Screening Pass/Fail results,
then one would build a numerical model from the training set in order to
predict whether or not a new molecule would pass or fail.

<li>

If the <i>y<sub>i</sub></i> are a physical property measurement (e.g.
octanol/water partition coefficient) of each molecule, then one would
build a numerical model to predict the physical property of a molecule
not in the training set.

</ul>

<p>
In order to build numerical models that depend on molecules it is necessary to
construct a numerical representation of a molecule.  Although the connection
table representation of a molecule (lists of atoms and bonds) is numerical, it
is not amenable to model building; a simpler representation is required.  To
this end, molecules are described with <i>n</i>-vectors of numbers called
<i>molecular descriptors</i>, or just <i>descriptors</i>, for the purposes of
model building.  A descriptor can be any quantity that depends on the molecule,
such as molecular weight, van der Waals volume, dipole moment and number of
carbon atoms.  Let <i>x<sub>ij</sub></i> denote the <i>j</i>-th descriptor of
the <i>i</i>-th molecule and
<i>x<sub>i</sub></i> denote the vector of <i>n</i> descriptors for the
<i>i</i>-th molecule.

<p>
A model is a numerical formula that is parameterized using the training set.
This numerical formula accepts, as input, a vector of molecular descriptors
which is used to predict an experimental result.  Any number of formulae can be
used to predict experimental results. The QuaSAR application suite contains
two:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
<i>Linear Regression Models</i>.  A linear model is a model in which the
experimental result is expressed as a linear combination of the descriptors
plus a constant.  The parameters, or coefficients, for the model are determined
in such a way that the mean squared error between the training set's
experimental results and the model's results is minimized.

<p>
<li>
<i>Binary Models</i>.  A binary model assumes that the experimental result is a
binary value (1 or 0) representing Pass/Fail or Active/Inactive.  The binary
model is statistical in that it uses the training set to estimate the
probability that a new molecule will have an experimental result of 1.

</ol>

<p>
The quality of a model is reported in statistical terms (e.g.
correlation coefficient or percent accurate).  This means that an underlying
assumption of model building is the fact that the training set is
<i>representative</i>; in other words, it is an unbiased, sufficiently large
sample of molecules.  More precisely, the methods assume that the training set
can be modeled with independent and identically distributed random
variables. Unfortunately, it is impossible to determine empirically whether or
not this is true for a given data set.  It is up to the user of the method to
make this assessment.

<p>
Some of the effects of training set bias can be corrected. In particular, the
assignment of <i>importance weights</i> or <i>row weights</i> is used to remove
bias.  For example, suppose that the training set contained molecules <i>A</i>
and <i>B</i> that are very similar (in some sense), and molecules <i>C</i>,
<i>D</i> and <i>E</i> that are mutually similar.  Rather than remove molecules
<i>B, D</i> and <i>E</i> from the training set to remove bias, one can weight
<i>A</i> and <i>B</i> each with 1/2 and <i>C</i>, <i>D</i> and <i>E</i> each
with 1/3.  This weighting scheme allows all of the training set to be used and
at the same time &quot;flattens&quot; the distribution of molecules.

<p>
Once a model has been built, it is necessary to assess its predictiveness.  A
model that is capable of reproducing the training set experimental results
accurately may not perform well on new molecules.  This phenomenon is called
<i>overfitting</i> and generally indicates that there are too many parameters
in the model or that the training set is not large enough.  The QuaSAR
application suite contains methods for removing outliers (training set
molecules with very large model errors) as well as
<i>cross-validation</i>. Cross-validation is a procedure by which portions of
the training set are left out of the model building and subsequently used to
simulate &quot;new&quot; molecules.

<p>
In summary, the process of building a model of experimental data generally
proceeds as follows:

<ol>
<li>
Assemble a database of experimental results and molecular structures.

<li>
Calculate importance weights for each molecule in the training set.

<li>
Calculate molecular descriptors for each molecule in the training set.

<li>
Estimate the parameters of a numerical model.

<li>
Remove outliers from the training set (this can be done using the plot
area in the Database Viewer).

<li>
Assess the predictiveness of the model.

<li>
If the model is not satisfactory, return to step 3.
</ol>

<p>
The MOE QuaSAR application suite contains all the tools required to
build models.  
Once a satisfactory model has been built, it can be used to predict experimental
data for new molecules or analyzed in order to understand the
important factors determining the experimental value.
QuaSAR applications in MOE include:

<ul>
<p><li><b><a href="qbct.htm">QuaSAR-Classify</a></b> creates a binary
classification tree used to classify items for which measurements have been
made. It can also be used to predict data classes.

<p><li><b><a href="cluster.htm">QuaSAR-Cluster</a></b> is used to assign
importance weights to the training set.

<p><li><b><a href="qcont.htm">QuaSAR-Contingency</a></b> is a statistical
application designed to assist in the selection of descriptors for QSAR or
QSPR.  It performs a contingency analysis for each descriptor and produces a
table of coefficients.

molecular descriptors.

<p><li><b><a href="hole.htm">QuaSAR-HoleFiller</a></b> generates a new database

databases.
