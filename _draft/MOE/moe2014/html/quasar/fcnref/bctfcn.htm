<h2>Description</h2>

<pre>
<span class="fcndef">bct_Tree</span> [
    mdb	      : mdb,
    pred      : 'pred_field',
    use_sel   : flag,
    treefile  : 'filename'
];
</pre>

<p>Opens a panel for creating and
displaying binary classification trees,
and for performing class predictions using classification trees.
This function does nothing when called in MOE batch.

<p>The optional arguments are given as a tagged vector with
the following possible fields:

<p>

<dl>
<dt><tt>mdb:mdb</tt> 
<dd>Specifies a MOE database (given
as either a token or a database key)
which can be used for building a classification tree, or on which
class predictions can be performed.
The default is <tt>''</tt>.

<p><dt><tt>pred:'pred_field'</tt> 
<dd>Specifies that the predicted classes are
to be written to the database <tt>mdb</tt> in
a field called <tt>'pred_field'</tt>, given as a field
name token.  If a field of this name already exists, it is overwritten;
otherwise, a new field of this name is created.  The default is
<tt>'$PRED'</tt>.
 
<p><dt><tt>use_sel:flag</tt> 
<dd>If <tt>flag</tt> is non-zero, specifies that class
predictions are to be made for only selected entries in the database.
The value of the flag is ignored in MOE batch; when running
in batch, predictions are made for all entries.  The default is 0.
 
<p><dt><tt>treefile:'filename'</tt> 
<dd>Specifies that the classification
tree stored in the tree file <tt>'filename'</tt>
is to be used for making class predictions.  <tt>'filename'</tt>
must be a token.  The default is <tt>''</tt>.

</dl>

<p><a name="bct_PredictMDB"></a></p>
<p><hr noshade="noshade" />

<pre>
<span class="fcndef">bct_PredictMDB</span> [
    mdb      : mdb,
    pred     : 'pred_field',
    use_sel  : flag,
    treefile : 'filename'
];
</pre>

<p>Performs class prediction on the MOE database
<tt>mdb</tt>, specified as either a name token or a database key.

<p>The optional arguments are given as a tagged vector with the following
possible fields:

<p>
<dl>
<dt><tt>mdb:mdb</tt>
<dd>Specifies the database on which predictions are to be
made using the tree loaded from the specified tree file.  If the database
contains a field of the same name as the class field that was used to
build the tree, the misclassification (error) rate of the predictions
is calculated.  If QuaSAR descriptor fields used in the tree node
splitting rules are missing from the database, they are calculated
if a molecule field is present.  Otherwise, missing fields
used in node splitting are substituted with zeroes.

<p><dt><tt>pred:'pred_field'</tt> 
<dd>Specifies that the predicted classes are
to be written to a field called <tt>'pred_field'</tt>, given as a field
name token.  If a field of this name already exists, it is overwritten;
otherwise, a new field of this name is created.
The default is <tt>'$PRED'</tt>.

<p><dt><tt>use_sel:flag</tt> 
<dd>If <tt>flag</tt> is non-zero, specifies that class
predictions are to be made for only selected entries in the database.
In batch MOE, if non-zero, no predictions are made.
The default is 0.

<p><dt><tt>treefile:'filename'</tt> 
<dd>Specifies that the classification
tree stored in the tree file <tt>'filename'</tt>
is to be used for making class predictions.
The default is <tt>''</tt>.

<tt>bct_CreateTreeMDB</tt> creates a binary classification tree.



<p>The optional arguments are given as a tagged vector with the following
possible fields:

<p>

<dl>

<dt><tt>learnmdb:'filename'</tt> 
<dd>
Name of the learning database.  A valid learning database must be provided
for a tree to be created.  The default is <tt>''</tt>.

<p>
<dt><tt>testmdb:'filename'</tt> 
<dd>
Name of the test database.  If no test database file is specified, then no
test data is used.  The default is <tt>''</tt>.
This option has no effect if either <tt>cv:1</tt> (cross-validation) or
<tt>same_db:1</tt> (same learning and test databases) has been specified.
In these cases, the test data are drawn from the learning database.

<p>
<dt><tt>classfd:'classfield'</tt> 
<dd>
Name of the class data field in the learning database.  Class data
should comprise a small set of categorical values.  If the class field
does not exist in the test database, then no test data will be used.  The
default is <tt>'class'</tt>.

<p>
<dt><tt>fields:['field1',...]</tt> 
<dd>
Names of the learning database fields to be used for tree creation.
Any specified fields missing from the test database are either
calculated (if they are QuaSAR descriptor fields) or substituted with 0.
The class field is automatically excluded from the set of candidate
fields.  If no fields are specified, no tree is created.  The default is
<tt>[]</tt>.

<p>
<dt><tt>cv:flag</tt> 
<dd>
If <tt>flag</tt> is non-zero, specifies that cross-validation be used in
the tree creation process.  The default is 0.

<p>
<dt><tt>same_db:flag</tt> 
<dd>
If <tt>flag</tt> is non-zero, specifies that both learning and test data
are to be drawn from the same database. The learning data comprises all
selected entries, and the test data all unselected entries.  It is
permissible to have all entries selected (i.e. no test data).  The
default is 1.  This option has no effect if <tt>cv:1</tt> is specified.
In MOE/batch no tree is created when <tt>flag</tt> is non-zero (and
<tt>cv:0</tt>).

<p>
<dt><tt>rand_set:flag</tt> 
<dd>
If <tt>flag</tt> is non-zero, specifies that the learning set is to
be drawn as a random sample from the source database.  This option has
effect only when <tt>same_db</tt> is non-zero.  The default is 0.

<p>
<dt><tt>rand_set_size:learning_size</tt> 
<dd>
The size of the learning set that is randomly drawn from the source database.
This option has effect only when <tt>rand_set</tt> is non-zero.  The default
is 100.

<p>
<dt><tt>rand_set_iter:niter</tt> 
<dd>
The number of random trees that are built.  This option has effect only
when <tt>same_db</tt> is non-zero.  The default is 50.

<p>
<dt><tt>learnsel:flag</tt> 
<dd>
If <tt>flag</tt> is non-zero, specifies that only selected entries from
the learning database constitute the learning data set.  If the Database
Viewer is not open, no tree is created.  The default is 0.

<p>
<dt><tt>testsel:flag</tt> 
<dd>
If <tt>flag</tt> is non-zero, specifies that only selected entries from
the test database constitute the test data set.  If the Database Viewer is
not open, no test data is used.
This option has no effect if either <tt>cv:1</tt> (cross-validation) or
<tt>same_db:1</tt> (same learning and test databases) has been specified.
The default is 0.

<p>
<dt><tt>nsubsets:num_cv_subsets</tt> 
<dd>
Number of subsets to use in cross-validation.  This option has no
effect if cross-validation is not being used (<tt>cv:0</tt>).  The default
is 2.

<p>
<dt><tt>cvrand:flag</tt> 
<dd>
If <tt>flag</tt> is non-zero, specifies that the cross-validation subsets
will be randomly drawn rather than sequentially divided up.  The default
is 1.
This option has no effect if cross-validation is not used (<tt>cv:0</tt>).

<p>
<dt><tt>nmin:node_size</tt>
<dd>
Node size beyond which no splitting will take place. In other words, if
the size of a node is less than or equal to <tt>node_size</tt>, the node
becomes a leaf of the tree.  The default is 10.

<p>
<dt><tt>do_subsample:flag</tt>
<dd>
If <tt>flag</tt> is non-zero, then if a node has size larger than
<tt>maxsamplesize</tt>, a randomly drawn data subset of size
<tt>maxsamplesize</tt> is used for determining the node splitting rule.
The default is 1.

<p>
<dt><tt>maxsamplesize:ssize</tt>
<dd>
Maximum data sample size that will be used to determine a node
splitting rule.
The default is 255.
This option has no effect if <tt>do_subsample</tt> is 0.

<p>
<dt><tt>maxdepth:n</tt>
<dd>
Maximum tree depth during the tree-growing phase.  The root has depth
0.  The default is 10.

<p>
<dt><tt>nordered:thresh</tt>
<dd>
Number of unique values a field of numbers or characters must contain
for the field data to be considered ordered.  If the field contains less
than <tt>thresh</tt> unique values, the data is considered to be
categorical.  Tokens are always taken to be categorical.  The default is
4.

<p>
<dt><tt>usepriors:flag</tt>
<dd>
If <tt>flag</tt> is non-zero, then the data classes will be weighted so
that all classes have equal importance during the tree-building phase;
otherwise, they are not weighted.  The default is 1.

<p>
<dt><tt>numsd:num_stderr</tt>
<dd>
Number of standard errors away from the minimum cost subtree that
the output tree will be.  The default is 1.

<p>
<dt><tt>savefile:'treefile'</tt> 
<dd>
Filename of the file in which to save the newly created tree.  If no
filename is specified, the tree is not saved.  The default is
<tt>'tree.bct'</tt>.

<p>
<dt><tt>reportfile:'reportfile'</tt> 
<dd>
Filename of the file in which to write a tree report.
If no filename is specified, a report is not written.
The default is <tt>'tree.rep'</tt>.
