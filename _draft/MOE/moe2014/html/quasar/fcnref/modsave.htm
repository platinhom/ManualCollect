<h2>Description</h2>

<p><span class="fcndef">model_Save</span>
is used in both batch and graphical MOE to save a
composite model to a file.  The resulting file can then be evaluated over
a database.

<p>The output file, input model files and combining operation
must all be specified.  The remaining arguments are optional.
All arguments are given as a tagged vector with
the following possible fields:

<p>

<dl>

<dt><tt>save_file: 'output_filename'</tt>
<dd>Specifies the file to be written.  Please note that
if the file already exists, it will be overwritten.
The name of the output file must be supplied.

<p>
<dt><tt>title: 'model_title'</tt>
<dd>Specifies an optional model title.  This title is
saved to the model file and viewable from the Model Options
sub-panel of the Model-Composer application.

<p>
<dt><tt>comment: 'comment'</tt>
<dd>Specifies an optional comment field.  The text of the comment is saved
to the model file and viewable from the Model Options sub-panel of the
Model-Composer application.


<p>
<dt><tt>wrbin: write_binary</tt>
<dd>If non-zero, then the individual models making up the composite model
will be written to the output file in binary form.  This is useful when
precision is an issue, for example, in QSAR models.  The default is 0.

<p>
<dt><tt>model_files: [filename1, ..., filenameN]</tt>
<dd>Specifies the names of the model files to be
included in the composite model.  If a database field
is to be used, the name of the database is specified;
in this case, <tt>model_options</tt> must be used to
give the names of the database fields to include.
At least one model file must be specified for inclusion.
If a model file cannot be found, an error will occur.
 
<p>
<dt><tt>model_names: [name1, ..., nameN]</tt>
<dd>Specifies, for each model in <tt>model_files</tt>, a unique name.
The model names are only used when the combining operation <tt>op</tt>
is <tt>'eval'</tt>, in which case the names can be used in the combining
expression <tt>expr</tt>.  When <tt>op</tt> is not <tt>'eval'</tt>, the
model names are ignored.  The default, when no model names are specified,
is to name each model alphabetically, according to the order in which they
appear in the <tt>model_files</tt> list, i.e. the first model will be called
<tt>A</tt>, the second <tt>B</tt>, etc.  The names appear in the expression
prefixed by a <tt>$</tt> symbol, i.e. <tt>$<i>name</i></tt>.

<p>When database fields are used, the same applies: each database field
is treated as its own model, and the name used in <tt>expr</tt> is
again the model name prefixed by a <tt>$</tt> symbol.

<p>Note that the model names are not
guaranteed to be preserved in the saved file as remapping of names may occur.

<p>
<dt><tt>op: 'combining_operation'</tt>
<dd>Specifies how the included models are to be arithmetically combined.  The
possible values are <tt>'product'</tt>, <tt>'sum'</tt>, <tt>'average'</tt>,
<tt>'min'</tt>, <tt>'max'</tt>, <tt>'variance'</tt>, <tt>'user'</tt>,
<tt>'eval'</tt>.  The combining operation must be specified.

<p>If <tt>'user'</tt> is the operation, then the <tt>user_function</tt>
option must be provided.

<p>It <tt>'eval'</tt> is the operation, then the <tt>expr</tt>
option must be provided.

<p>
<dt><tt>user_function: 'function_name'</tt>
<dd>
If <tt>op</tt> is <tt>'user'</tt>, <tt>user_function</tt> must be specified
to give the name of the function to be used for combining the individual
models.  It is the responsibility of the user to ensure that the individual
model results are appropriate arguments for the function.

<p>
<dt><tt>expr: 'combining_expression'</tt>
<dd>If <tt>op</tt> is <tt>'eval'</tt>, <tt>expr</tt> must be used to
give the arithmetical expression used for combining the individual models
specified in <tt>model_files</tt>.  If the <tt>model_names</tt> option
is being used, then those names can be used in the expression in the
form <tt>$<i>name</i></tt>, i.e. preceded by <tt>'$'</tt>.  If no model
names were specified, then the models are assigned alphabetical letters as
names (in order from A to Z) by default, in the order they appear in the
<tt>model_files</tt> list.

<p>Note that the specified model names are not guaranteed to be preserved
in the saved file as remapping of names may occur.

<p>
<dt><tt>model_options: [opt1, ..., optN]</tt>
<dd>
Specifies a set of options for each model in <tt>model_files</tt>.
Note that each set of options must be provided as a separated tagged vector
and that there must be one for each model file.

<pre>
    optn = [
	use_log		: flag,
	use_complement	: flag,
	use_min		: flag,
	use_max		: flag,
	min		: lower_threshold_value,
	max		: upper_threshold_value,
	weight		: scale_factor,
	dbfields	: 'field_names'
    ]
</pre>

<p>Please note that all options, with the exception of <tt>dbfields</tt>,
have effect only when the combining operation <tt>op</tt> is <i>not</i>
<tt>'eval'</tt>.  When <tt>op</tt> is <tt>'eval'</tt>, the expression used
is exactly that given by the combining expression <tt>expr</tt>.

<p>When multiple database fields are specified, all options can be specified
on a per-field basis, i.e. a value given for each database field.  Thus,
the option values can be either of length 1, in which case the same value
is applied to all database fields (unit extension), or of the same length
as the number of database fields.

<p>The options are as follows:

<p>
<dl>

<dt><tt>use_log: flag</tt>

<dd>If <tt>flag</tt> is non-zero, then the log of the model
will be used in the combining expression.  If <tt>use_complement</tt> is
also on, then <span class="nobr"><tt>log (1-x)</tt></span> will be used.  The default is 0.

<p>
<dt><tt>use_complement: flag</tt>

<dd>If <tt>flag</tt> is non-zero, then the complement (<tt>1-x</tt>)
of the model will be used in the combining expression.
If <tt>use_log</tt> is also on, then <span class="nobr"><tt>log (1-x)</tt></span> will
be used.  The default is 0.

<p>
<dt><tt>use_min: flag</tt>
<dd>If <tt>flag</tt> is non-zero, then a lower threshold will be
applied to the model, giving a binary result.  The
<tt>min</tt> option must be used in conjunction with a non-zero
<tt>use_min</tt> value.  The default is 0.

<p>
<dt><tt>use_max: flag</tt>
<dd>If <tt>flag</tt> is non-zero, then an upper threshold will be
applied to the model, giving a binary result.  The
<tt>max</tt> option must be used in conjunction with a non-zero
<tt>use_max</tt> value.  The default is 0.

<p>
<dt><tt>min: lower_threshold_value</tt>
<dd>If <tt>use_min</tt> is non-zero, specifies a lower threshold
to apply to the model result.  The resulting binary value will be
1 if the model value is greater than or equal to the specified
threshold.

<p>
<dt><tt>max: upper_threshold_value</tt>
<dd>If <tt>use_max</tt> is non-zero, specifies an upper threshold
to apply to the model result.  The resulting binary value will be
1 if the model value is less than the specified threshold.

<p>
<dt><tt>weight: scale_factor</tt>
<dd>Specifies a scaling factor for the model result.  The model
result will be multiplied by this factor before being included
in the combining expression.

<p>
<dt><tt>dbfields: 'field_names'</tt>
<dd>

If database fields are to be included in the composite model,
this option must be specified.  The corresponding file in
the <tt>model_files</tt> list must be a database file.
The field names are given as tokens and the fields
must be of numeric type.
