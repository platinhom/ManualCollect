<a name="Introduction" /><h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Contacts between atoms of proteins or between proteins and ligands can
be examined by the Protein Contacts panel.  Four types of contacts can be
identified: hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic, ionic bonds, and disulfide bonds. 

<p>The panel performs a variety of functions, such as computing contact
networks (regions of stabilizing contacts), producing text reports, and 
visualizing the contacts in the MOE Window and Sequence Editor.


<a name="Performing" /><h2>Performing Contact Analysis</h2>

<p>
The Protein Contacts panel can be opened from either the MOE window or
the Sequence Editor by choosing:
<ul>
<li><span class="menu">MOE | Protein | Contacts</span> or
<li><span class="menu">SE | Protein | Contacts</span>
</ul>

<p><center>
<img src="procontacts/empty.png" alt="Empty Protein Contacts Panel">
</center>

<p>
The <b>Search</b> button at the lower left of the panel begins 
the collection of contacts.  The search may be controlled by the two
<b>Restrict Search</b> options, which must be chosen before the search begins.

<p>The first option determines which residues may be involved in contacts.
Each contact may be forced to involve either:
<UL>
<LI> at least one selected
residue, meaning that contacts between two unselected residues would be
ignored, or
<LI> two selected residues, meaning that a contact would be ignored
if either of its residues were unselected.
</UL>

<p>The second option determines which chains may be involved in contacts.
Each contact may be forced to involve either: 
<UL>
<LI>
at least one residue from
a selected chain, meaning that contacts between two residues, each from
an unselected chain, would be ignored, or
<LI> two residues from selected
chains, meaning that a contact would be ignored if either of its residues
were from an unselected chain.
</UL>  

The default action is not to
restrict based on either residue selection or chain selection at all.

<p>
After the search is completed, the contacts are displayed in the list.

<P ALIGN=CENTER>
<IMG SRC="procontacts/contacts.png" alt="Protein Contacts Panel">
</P>

<p>Each line in the list describes a single contact. 
For example, the first contact in the figure above appears as:

<center>
<p>
<pre>
     Type   Chain     Pos Residue       Chain     Pos Residue      Net
1     HB    1:1MCT.A   16 ILE16.N       1:1MCT.A  204 ASP194.OD2     2
</pre>
</p>
</center>

<p>
<table border="1" width="100%" cellpadding="2">

<tr>
<td> &nbsp;
<td> <tt>1</tt> 
<td> The contact number (simply the order in the list)

<tr>
<td> <tt>Type</tt> 
<td> <tt>HB</tt>
<td> The type of contact: hydrogen bond (HB), 
     hydrophobic (HYD), ionic bond (ION), or Disulfide (S-S)

<tr>
<td> <tt>Chain</tt>
<td> <tt>1:1MCT.A</tt>
<td> The chain number and name 
to which the first residue of the contact belongs

<tr>
<td> <tt>Pos</tt>
<td> <tt>16</tt>
<td> The position of the first residue of the contact in the Sequence Editor

<tr>
<td> <tt>Residue</tt>
<td> <tt>ILE16.N</tt>
<td> The first residue and atom of the contact

<tr>
<td> <tt>Chain</tt>
<td> <tt>1:1MCT.A</tt>
<td> The chain to which the second residue of the contact belongs

<tr>
<td> <tt>Pos</tt>
<td> <tt>204</tt>
<td> The position of the second residue of the contact in the Sequence Editor

<tr>
<td> <tt>Residue</tt>
<td> <tt>ASP194.OD2</tt>
<td> The second residue and atom of the contact

<tr>
<td> <tt>Network</tt>
<td> <tt>2</tt>
<td> The number of the network to which the contact belongs (see below).

</table>

<p>
In this case, the contact is a hydrogen bond contact between the N atom
of ILE16 and the OD2 atom of ASP194, both of chain 1 (1MCT.A), and belongs
to network number 2.

<p>
<a name="networks">A network</a> is a group of contacts of similar type which
form a path through the alignment by linking residue to residue.  In the
example below, the first few contacts in the list between positions 34-41,
34-42, 35-41, 35-65 form network number 13.  We say that contacts 34-41 and
34-42 are <i>network neighbors</i>, as are 35-41 and 35-65, and 34-41 and
35-41, since each pair shares an alignment position.  Thus the four contacts
form a network.  The network can also be controlled by the
<a href="#network separation">Network Separation</a> parameter.

<p align=center>
<img src="procontacts/network.png" alt="Hydrogen Bond Network">
</p>

<p> Since there is no such path connecting these contacts to the contact
between positions 46-57, this contact does not belong to network number 13.
Each network usually is therefore a local region of high contact density.

<p>
Each network is given its own ID number, so in the example above, there are at
least 23 networks.  (Others may exist lower down in the list.)  The ID
numbers are given so that the largest network has ID 1, the second largest has
ID 2, etc.  In this example, the largest network is a hydrophobic contact
network.

<a name="Displaying"></a><h3>Displaying the Contacts</h3>

<p>The <b>List Contacts</b> options determine the type of contacts to display
(hydrogen bond, hydrophobic, ionic, or disulfide), 
whether to infer hypothetical contacts between sequence-only residues, and
whether to display contacts within chains or between chains, 
The <b>Sort By</b> then orders the contacts appropriately.

<td valign="top"><b>HB</b> 
<td valign="top">Displays hydrogen bond contacts in the list,
determined according to the criteria
proposed by Stickle and Rose [Stickle&nbsp;1992].  Both
sidechain-to-sidechain and sidechain-to-mainchain hydrogen bond contacts
can be calculated (see <a href="#Search">Search Preferences</a> below).
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>HYD</b>

</tr>


<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Inferred</b> 
<td valign="top"> List hypothetical contacts between sequence-only residues.
For each real contact between residues with atoms, a contact between 
sequence-only residues in the same position is inferred if there would exist
atoms to form the contact.  For example, the ionic bond contacts between
residues of chain 3 below, which contains sequence-only data (the atoms
were deleted to allow for this example),
were inferred at positions 21-160 and 60-108.
This coincides with real ionic bond contacts found in chains 1 and 2.
Because each pair of inferred contact residues GLU-ARG and HIS-ASP contain
one acidic and one basic residue, the contact is listed.
When a contact is inferred, the atom is denoted as <tt>-</tt>.
Note that no contacts were inferred in chain 3 at positions 
21-75, 91-257, or 113-257.  The residues in chain 3 at these positions
were not able to form ionic bonds.

<p>
Contacts between sequence-only residues and residues with atoms
(such as a contact between a ligand and a sequence-only receptor) are also
inferred if the <b>Between: Different Chains</b> option is chosen, and if
the receptor and the ligand have the same tag.

<h3> <a name="Conserved">Conserved Contacts and Required Chains</a> </h3>

The <b>Conservation</b> value filters out contacts which do not appear in more
than a specified number of chains.  For example, if the conservation value is
10, then an ionic bond contact between residues at positions X-Y will appear in
the list only if an ionic bond contact between positions X-Y occur in at least
10 of the chains.  If the contact is between different chains, then it would be
displayed only if it occurs between at least 10 pairs of chains.  We would then
say that the contact is <i>conserved</i> over the 10 chains.
