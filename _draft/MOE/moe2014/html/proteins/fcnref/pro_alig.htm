<h2>Description</h2>

<pre>
<span class="fcndef">pro_Align</span> [ chains, options ]
</pre>

<p>Performs a multiple sequence alignment of the submitted chains.  If
structure-based realignment is enabled, then chains with complete alpha-carbon
traces will be realigned according to global superposition information followed
by a second sequence-identity based alignment if necessary. If passed null,
<tt>pro_Align</tt> displays the MOE-Align panel.

<dl>

<dt><tt>chains</tt>

<dd>Keys of chains to be aligned.

<p><dt><tt>options</tt>

<dd>Options control the number and type of sequence-only iterations as well as
various aspects of the structure-based alignment.  The sequence-identity
group-to-group alignments are controlled by the <tt>mda</tt>, <tt>gapstart</tt>
and <tt>gapextend</tt> parameters.  The iterative refinement stage of the
alignment procedure is controlled by the <tt>shuffle</tt>,
<tt>max_iterations</tt> and <tt>failure_count</tt> parameters.

<p>Optional arguments are attribute-value colon-separated pairs:

<p><dl>
<dt><tt>mda:'token'</tt>

<dd>Name of an amino acid substitution scoring matrix, supplied as a token.
The name will be concatenated onto the value of the configuration parameter in
the <a href="../../appendix/moeconfig.htm">MOE configuration resource file</a>
(or using the Matrix Path field in the Protein Defaults page of the <a
href="../../appendix/settings.htm">Configuration Options</a> panel) to produce
a full path specification.  The default is <tt>'blosum62'</tt>.

<p><dt><tt>gapstart:real</tt>

<dd>Penalty (a non-negative real number) for creating a gap in one sequence
with respect to another.  The default is 3.0.

<p><dt><tt>gapextend:real</tt>

<dd>Penalty imposed for each residue that is aligned against a gap in another
sequence.  The default is 1.0.

<p><dt><tt>pairwise:flag</tt>

<dd>Set to 1 to perform sequence alignment according to the protocol specified
by the <tt>method</tt> option.  If 0, no pair-wise sequence alignment is done.
The default is 1.

<p><dt><tt>method:'token'</tt>

<dd>Method of pair-wise sequence-alignment specified as a token.  Legal values
are:

<p><dl>
<dt><tt>'progressive'</tt>

<dd>The first two chains are aligned together, the third is aligned against the
first two, and so forth - all other chains being successively aligned to those
already processed.

<p><dt><tt>'tree-based'</tt>

<dd>All pair-wise alignment scores are calculated, and a full-sequence
alignment is built by aligning chain pairs with the highest scores first.
</dl>

<p>The default is <tt>'tree-based'</tt>.

<p><dt><tt>round_robin:flag</tt>

<dd>Set to 1 to extract each sequence in turn from the alignment and realign it
against the other chains taken as a group. If 0, no round-robin alignments are
performed.  The default is 1.

<p><dt><tt>shuffle:flag</tt>

<dd>Set to 1 to perform a series of group-to-group alignments between random
partitions of the entire set of chains.  If 0, no shuffled alignments are done.
The default is 1.

<p><dt><tt>max_iterations:real</tt>

<dd>Maximum number of realignments that will be calculated.  The default is
100.

<p><dt><tt>failure_count:real</tt>

<dd>Number of failed consecutive attempts to improve the alignment score after
which iterative refinement is terminated.  The default is 10.

<p><dt><tt>chain_selection:'token'</tt>

<dd>Effect of the current chain selection.  Legal token values are:

<p><dl>
<dt><tt>'align'</tt>

<dd>Align only the selected chains.

<p><dt><tt>'freeze'</tt>

<dd>Treat the selected chains as an indivisible unit in the alignment
procedure.

<p><dt><tt>'partition'</tt>

<dd>Perform group-to-group alignment between the selected and the non-selected
chains.

<p><dt><tt>'ignore'</tt>

<dd>Ignore the chain selection state.
</dl>

<p>The default is <tt>'ignore'</tt>.

<p><dt><tt>sec_struct:'token'</tt>

<dd>The role secondary structure is to play in the alignment.  Legal token
values are:

<p><dl>
<dt><tt>'none'</tt>

<dd>Do not use secondary structure attributes in the sequence alignment.

<p><dt><tt>'predicted'</tt>

<dd>Modify residue substitution scores and position-dependent gap penalties
according to predicted secondary structure values.

<p><dt><tt>'actual'</tt>

<dd>Modify residue substitution scores and position-dependent gap penalties
according to DSSP secondary structure assignments.  </dl>

<p>The default is <tt>'none'</tt>.



<p><dt><tt>enable_structural:flag</tt>

<dd>Set to 1 to perform structure-based realignment of chains with complete
alpha-carbon traces. If there are also sequences with no associated structure
amongst the arguments, then a second round of sequence-only alignment will be
performed afterward, with the internal alignment of the realigned chains held
fixed. If 0, no structure-based alignment is performed.  The default is 1.

<p><dt><tt>gapstart_structural:real</tt>

<dd>Penalty (a non-negative real number) imposed in a structural alignment for
creating a gap in one structure with respect to another. The default is 1.0.

<p><dt><tt>gapextend_structural:real</tt>

<dd>Penalty (a real number) imposed during structural realignment for each
residue which is aligned against a gap in another structure. The default is
0.1.

<p><dt><tt>superpose:flag</tt>

<dd>Set to 1 to superpose chains with 3D coordinates after the alignment is
complete.  If 0, no superposition is performed.  The default is 1.

</dl>

<pre>
    Close [];
    Open '$MOE/sample/mol/serine_prot.moe';
    pro_Align [ Chains[] ];
