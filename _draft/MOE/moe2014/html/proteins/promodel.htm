<p>The purpose of the Homology Model application is to build and refine 
all-atom 3D models for protein sequences, based on homologous template
protein structures.  Models can be built in the presence of ligands,
prosthetic groups or other molecular entities, and can also be built as
multimers - dimers, trimers or tetramers - by specifying separate
sequence-template correspondences in the GUI.

<p>The Homology Model application is opened by choosing <b>Homology Model</b>
from either the <b><nobr>SE | Protein </nobr></b> menu or the
<b><nobr>MOE | Protein</nobr></b> menu.

<p><b>Note!</b> The Homology Model application supports MOE/cluster (MOE/smp) cluster
computing. If run under a MOE/smp session, Homology Model will run in parallel.
For information on how to configure your system in order to make
use of multiple processors, please refer to 
<a href="../install/smp_inst.htm">Installing and Running MOE/smp</a>.

<h2><a name="methodology">Methodology</a></h2>

<P>The Homology Model method comprises the following steps:

<ol>
<li><b>Initial Partial Geometry Specification.</b>

<p>An initial partial geometry for each target sequence is copied from regions
of one or more template chains.  Where residue identity is conserved between
the target sequence and its template, all heavy-atom coordinates are copied;
otherwise, only backbone coordinates are copied.
Note, however, that if a proline residue
in the target sequence is aligned to a non-proline in its template and the
&phi; angle at that position is positive, then the no coordinates are copied:
the position will be treated as an indel (see step 2). 
Disulfide bonds will be copied to the model whenever the half-cystines
comprising a disulfide bond in a template chain are both aligned to cystines
in the target sequence.  Optionally, disulfide bridges can be created during
the side chain packing procedure (see step three).

<p><b>Note</b>: Atoms whose coordinates are copied from template atoms carry
along with them all attributes that affect energy minimization including
its <tt>Fixed</tt> status as well as tethers and restraints. 


<p><li>
<b>Insertions and Deletions</b>.

<p>After an initial partial geometry for the model has been
copied from the templates, some residues will still have no assigned backbone
coordinates.
These residues may be in loops (insertions in the model with respect to 
the template), "outgaps" (residues in a model sequence which
are aligned before the C-terminus or after the N-terminus of its template),
or in deletions&mdash;regions where the template has an
insertion with respect to the model.
In the latter case, it is unlikely that the copied
geometry on either side of the deletion will be correct for the new peptide
bond between them, in which case it may be ignored, thereby creating, in effect, an
insertion. We refer collectively to these cases where backbone geometries 
must be modeled as "indels".

<p>Indels are modeled from fragments of 
high-resolution chains from the Protein Data Bank [Berman&nbsp;2000]
which superpose well onto anchor residues on either side of the insertion area.
Following [Fechteler&nbsp;1995], the segment search
is permitted to back off from indel regions if no segment which
meets a specified RMSD criteria is found.
</p>

<li><b>Loop Selection and Sidechain Packing</b>

<p>After the indel data collection is complete, a set of independent
models is created.  Loops are modeled first, in random order.
For each loop, a contact energy function analyzes the list of candidates
collected in the segment searching stage,
taking into account all atoms already modeled and any atoms specified by 
the user as belonging to the model environment
(e.g. a ligand bound to the template, or structural waters). 
These energies are then used to make a Boltzmann-weighted choice from the
candidates, the coordinates of which are then copied to the model.


<p>Once all of the loops have been chosen, the side chains are modeled.
Sidechain data is assembled from an extensive rotamer library 
generated by systematic clustering of conformations from 
<a href="buildrotlib.htm#LowModeMDLib">LowModeMD</a>.
A deterministic procedure based on Unary Quadratic Optimization is then
run to select an optimal packing.


<p>After all of the backbone segment and sidechain conformations have been
chosen for an intermediate model, hydrogens are added to complete valence
requirements and the model is submitted to a series of minimizations designed
to first relieve any serious steric strains, and then to prepare the model
to be scored. It is then written to the output database, along with a number
of quality assessment measurements which can flag any serious geometric
problems.

<p><li>
<b>Final Model Selection and Refinement</b>

<p>The final model is based on the best-scoring intermediate model.
The following choices are available for selecting the final model:

<ul>
<li>
the RMSD of each intermediate model to the average position of all of the
intermediate models (either all-heavy atom, or C<span class='LaTeX'>\( \alpha \)</span> only);

<li>
the <i>electrostatic solvation energy</i>, calculated used a
Generalized Born/Volume Integral (GB/VI) methodology [Labute&nbsp;2008]. 

<li>
a knowledge-based <i>residue packing quality function</i> derived from
a statistical survey of the environments in which amino acid residues
typically find themselves. Each residue is classified according its
<i>solvent accessibility</i>, its participation in <i>hydrogen bonded
contacts</i>, and the <i>ratio of polar vs non-polar</i>
contacting atoms in its micro-environment. Histograms of the
distributions of the various residue types into the different environment
classes  then allow for an estimation of the probability of observing a
particular string of amino acids in a specific set of environments in a
"normal" protein. The negative log of this probability is reported,
so that smaller values indicate higher probability structure-sequence
combinations.  Values between two and three are typically observed for
high-resolution structures; values over five suggest the presence of highly
atypical residue environments.

<li>
an estimation of the <i>effective atomic contact energy</i> (ACE) adapted by
[Zhang&nbsp;1997] from the procedure of [Miyazawa&nbsp;1985] in which the
effective energy difference for replacing residue-solvent contacts with
residue-residue contacts is based on observed contact frequencies in a
database of high-resolution protein structures. In [Zhang&nbsp;1997],
statistics are collected on atom-atom contacts between 18 different protein
atom types, identified by clustering all of the heavy atoms of the twenty
common amino acid types.

</ul>
</ol>

<p>Once the homology modeling procedure has finished, the final model
should be inspected using MOE's
<A href="../apps/progeom.htm">Protein Geometry</a> stereochemical quality
evaluation tools in order
to confirm that the model's stereochemistry is reasonably consistent with
typical values found in crystal structures.
Persistent problems may suggest a problem with the alignment used to
build the model; manual adjustments to the alignment may be necessary,
particularly in the loop areas, followed by a rebuilding of the model.

<h2><a name="running">Running Homology Model</a></h2>

<p>Homology Model operates on protein chains already loaded into MOE. To
prepare for a calculation, the following steps can be taken:
</p>

<ol>
<p><li>
<i>Load from one to four query protein sequences into MOE.</i>
<blockquote>
<span class="menu">MOE | File | Open | <i>filenames</i></span>
</blockquote>
These are the proteins to be modeled.
For homology modeling, these must be sequence-only chains.
One way to obtain sequence-only data is:
    <ol type="a">
    <li>
    In the Sequence Editor, select the chains for which to obtain
	sequence-only data.
    </li><li>
	<span class="menu">SE | Edit | Copy As | FastA</span>
    </li><li>
	<span class="menu">SE | Edit | Paste</span>
    </li>
    </ol>

</li></p><p><li>
<i>Identify and load template chains into MOE, one for each query sequence.</i>
<br />
<b>Note:</b>
If template chains are already available, load them into MOE and skip this step.
A template chain is assumed to
be homologous to the query, and to have atom coordinates.

in MOE, Amber99, Amber10 with Extended Hückel Theory (EHT), and Charmm27 are
specifically designed to support protein simulations. Amber99, in particular,
has been recommended by [Levitt&nbsp;2007] for protein homology applications. 
Note that Amber10 with EHT has been validated for use with proteins and nucleic
acids as opposed to Amber12 with EHT.
