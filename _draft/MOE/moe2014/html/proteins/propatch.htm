<p>The Protein Patch Analyzer application is used to generate visual
representations of protein surface patches as a means for predicting
locations highly prone to protein aggregation
or for rationalizing mutation sites, in order to
improve protein solubility.
The application offers a SAR-type approach with a high degree of flexibility
and interactivity and helps in conceptualizing the problem and in guiding the
decision making process for assigning potential mutations.

<a name="Overview"></a>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Therapeutic proteins have become the most rapidly
growing class of pharmaceuticals in the industry because of their remarkable
curative potential in a variety of diseases. While engineering
efforts have been focused on producing macromolecules with high target
specificity but low immunogenicity, the practical requirement of
storing such biotherapeutics in high concentration formulations
has led to an urgent new problem that must be addressed:
in the case of many antibodies, various forms of
aggregation can occur with a concomitant significant loss of drug efficacy
and higher rate of immunogenic response.
The control and reduction of aggregation
tendencies has thus become a high priority in the biopharmaceutical industry and
presents a serious challenge since aggregation is potentially encountered
during all manufacturing steps of the complex life cycle of a biotherapeutic
agent.
</p>

<!--
<p>
For example,
monoclonal antibodies are typically produced in cell culture and secreted in
the medium that contains cell nutrients, ions, host cell proteins and many other
species including proteases. They are then purified over Protein A
affinity chromatography which elutes the antibody at highly acidic conditions
(pH 3.2), followed by polishing steps that include cation exchange
chromatography, centrifugation and/or filtration
[Harris&nbsp;2004],[Cromwell&nbsp;2006].
</p>
-->

<p>
The underlying mechanisms for protein
aggregation are poorly understood.  This is substantiated by the fact
that there is no single analytical method available to cover the various
sizes and types of aggregation that appear in experiments or in production.
Covalent protein aggregates are commonly observed as a result of disulfide bond
formation of previously unpaired free thiols [Shahrokh&nbsp;1994].
Oxidation of tyrosines may also result in covalent aggregation through the
formation of bityrosine [Giulivi&nbsp;1994].
Other studies attribute a suppressing role to arginine residues in the formation of
aggregates [Tsumoto&nbsp;2004]. Furthermore, changes to the environment such as
in pH and ionic strength may promote deamidation and oxidation reactions,
which in turn
promote aggregation kinetics [Idicula-Thomas&nbsp;2007].
Glycosylation in antibodies has been shown to improve
homogeneity
and affect aggregation propensities [Wu&nbsp;2010][Kayser&nbsp;2011].
</p>

<p>
Reversible protein aggregates are typically the result of relatively weak
noncovalent interactions. In particular, hydrophobic interactions have long
been
recognized as major contributors in high affinity interactions between
macromolecules.  In antibodies, electrostatic interactions have been implicated
in forming self-associated aggregates [Karshikoff&nbsp;2006], while
dipole-dipole
interactions are believed to be the cause of fibrillogenic association of
&beta;-sheets.
</p>

<p>
A variety of computational tools have been developed in order to
assist scientists in understanding the complex mechanisms of protein aggregation
but have traditionally focused on amyloid-like aggregation due to its
importance in neurodegenerative diseases. These tools
employ a diverse set of computational methods ranging from a strict
bioinformatics or sequence-based approach to computationally expensive
molecular dynamics simulations in order to determine or predict
aggregation-prone regions (APRs) in proteins. The studies suggest that ARPs
become surface exposed upon conformational transition and are able to
facilitate intermolecular interaction [Agrawal&nbsp;2011].

Recently, a computational method
called Spatial Aggregation Propensity (SAP)
has been presented
that predicts aggregation propensities by identifying
hydrophobic surface patches [Chennamsetty&nbsp;2009].
</p>

<p>
In summary, the aggregation predictions provided by the computational tools
are limited because there is simply not enough information available for
validation.
<p>

        <!-- ======================== METHODS ====================== -->

<p>
<a name="Method"></a>
<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>
The main task of the Protein Patch Analyzer application is to determine the
hydrophilic and hydrophobic patch regions of a specified protein. The patches
are calculated on a
<a href="../apps/surfmap.htm#InteractionSurface">van der
Waals solvent accessible interaction surface</a>.
In brief, the interaction surface is calculated on a lattice and is a
0-potential contour of the van der Waals potential of a probe atom with
a molecule.  The interior of the 0-potential surface contains those
locations at which the probe van der Waals energy is positive; the
exterior has negative interaction energy.  More precisely,
define a potential <i>v</i>(<i>x</i>) as follows:
<p>
<p align="center"><img src="propatch/math_potentialfunction.png" /></p>
<p>
where <i>A<sub>i</sub></i> and <i>B<sub>i</sub></i> are the
OPLSA-AA van der Waals parameters [Jorgensen&nbsp;1996] with a water oxygen
used as a probe.  The interaction surface is close to the solvent
accessible surface of a molecule - the points of close contact of
water nucleus.
</p>
<p>
Three classes of surface patches are calculated on the basis of
electrostatic and hydrophobic potential calculations, allowing for
classification to <i>hydrophobic</i>, <i>negative</i> and <i>
positive</i> patches. As suggested by the class name, the positive patches
are associated with positive electrostatic
potential and negative with the negative patches.
The hydrophobic potential is calculated from the Wildman
and Crippen SlogP parameters [Wildman&nbsp;1999]:
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="propatch/math_Exyz_lipophilic.png" /></p>

<p>
where <i>f<sub>i</sub></i> is the contribution for atom <i>i</i> and
g(d<sub>i</sub>) is the Fermi-type distance function proposed by
Heiden <i>et al.</i> [Heiden&nbsp;1993]:
</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="propatch/math_fermi_distancefunction.png" />

<p>
with a proximity distance (<i>d<sub>cutoff</sub></i>) of 2.5 &Aring; and
&alpha; = 1.5.
<p>
The median of each potential value set is used as the iso-contour cutoff to
calculate the core patch areas on the surface; these are
then extended to adjacent
grid triangles to smoothen the patch transition.

</p>
The particular characteristics of APRs include high surface exposure and strong
interaction potential. While the latter is represented by the potential value
described above, the surface exposure property requires a surface
calculation by rolling a protein probe with a 5.0 &Aring; radius over the
target protein. The atom surface area values obtained from the protein probe
are then mapped back onto the interaction surface grid for visual inspection.
<p>
For each calculated patch, a series of properties are calculated,
including the patch surface area (&Aring;<sup>2</sup>), the
patch surface as a percentage of
the total surface area of the protein, the maximum potential
value measured within the patch (kcal/mol) and the average patch potential
(kcal/mol). In addition, the number of highly surface-exposed oxygen,
nitrogen and sulfur atoms are determined as well.  As mentioned in the
introduction, different residues may play important roles
in various forms of protein aggregation.

With respect to nitrogens, this includes
residues with propensities for deamidation, glycosylation or simply point to
exposed Arginine residues. For oxygens, the surface-exposed tyrosine residues
are of particular interest due to their ability to form covalent species.

<p>
The Protein Patch Analyzer panel may conceptually be divided into three sections:
<ul>
 <li>
  The top section specifies the protein(s) that are the basis for the surface
  patch calculations and the potential type for visualizing them.
 </li>

 <li>
  The middle section is designed to allow easy navigation through the results of
  the patch calculation and offers the user a set of controls to reduce/modify
  the content of the result table to a desired scope.
  This section is populated when <b>Calculate</b> is pressed.
 </li>

 <li>
  The bottom section allows for visual modulation of the patches as they are
  shown in the MOE Window. This includes the modification of each of the
  patch class colors, the transparency settings within or outside the patch
  regions as well as general rendering options for fine-tuning the
    patch visuals.

<td valign="top">
    Specify the patch viewing mode.
    Examining the patches in different modes could potentially reveal important
    information.
    As mentioned above in the Methodology section, patches are calculated
    based on their respective potential values which determine the
    sizes of the patches.  However, in general,
    the charge or hydrophobicity is not
    uniformly distributed within a particular patch. The
    potential distribution could be
    concentrated around a few residues within a larger patch area indicating
    "hot spots" for greasiness or charge.
    Such hot spots might look entirely different
    when inspected in the <tt>Surface Exposure</tt> mode if, for example,
    they lacked surface exposure; this would render
    them unsuitable for mutation.
    For some proteins,
    it is also interesting to compare the patches
    within a distinct class based on the potential average of the patches and
    visualize this comparison within the topology of a protein. Sometimes, this
    reveals interesting distribution patterns, when patches with comparatively
    high potential values are located in one section of the protein and weaker
    ones in other parts of the protein.

    <p>Each of the display modes has its own coloring scheme that may be
    modified in the <b>Color Settings</b> section described below.
    When elucidating APRs, it is strongly recommended to make use of these
    different viewing modes.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <p><li>
        <tt>Potential.</tt> This mode shows the potential values within the
        respective patches, possibly indicating hot spots for charge or
        hydrophobicity.
      </li></p>
      <p><li>
        <tt>Potential Average.</tt> In this viewing mode, the potential averages
        of a distinct patch class are compared.  By default,
        the associated coloring scheme has a resolution of 5% of the designated
        energy cutoffs (see <a href="#settings">Settings</a> below).
        This means that for each patch class,
        the patches with an average potential value in an energy bin of 5% are
        assigned the same color value. As a result, patches with a "strong"
        potential average are rendered in a darker color, and the "weak" patches
        in a lighter color. For some proteins, the distribution of
        weak and strong patches is not uniform with the protein topology and
        can be clearly seen in this viewing mode.
     </li></p>
     <p><li>
        <tt>Surface Exposure.</tt>
        This viewing mode allows for inspecting the patches
        merely on the basis of their exposure to a virtual protein probe.
        Highly exposed areas in this viewing mode are colored in a darker color
        tone based on the respective patch class
        (hydrophobic,
        negative or positive); buried patch areas are shown in very
        light or white color tones.
        In this way, the hotspots for potential interactivity with external
        macromolecules which represent potential mutation sites
        are easily detected.

<p style="clear:both;">
Given the differences in surface patch composition of hGH and the bovine model,
it is easy to conceptualize the differences in aggregation behavior. The APR
of 1HWG is entirely dominated by two large negative patches (#14 and #16) that
are completely devoid in the bovine model. The dominant patches within the APR
in bGH are the large hydrophobic patch #2 (339 &Aring; in size) and to a lesser
degree positive patch #37 (80 &Aring; in size). The large hydrophobic surface
patch (#2) that spans the entire APR region combined with surface-exposed
hydrophobic patches #14 and #3 form an ideal and large platform for non-specific
binding. The surface-exposed residues within these patches can be visualized by
the <tt>Surface Exposure</tt> visualization mode,
and represent prime targets for
potential mutations.
