<a name="Introduction"></a>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The purpose of 3D data preparation is to 
render raw 3D ligand input data that may contain errors,
missing annotations, and possibly other omissions,
into a form that is ready for computational experimentation.
Typical operations include enumeration of
tautomers and protonation states, standardization of
molecular structure (e.g. with respect to bonding
patterns), and, in many cases, conformational analysis.
An important component of data preparation is filtering
unwanted compounds &ndash; judicious
filtering at the appropriate moment can significantly reduce
running time by shrinking the number of molecules
to process.  Equally important, it can
eliminate undesirable or even chemically impossible molecules,
thus serving to unclutter the data.
</p>

<p>3D structure databases contain atomic coordinate data and are used
to store both complete molecules and molecular fragments; in the
latter case, the database is often referred to as a <i>fragment database</i>.
All 3D structure databases are prepared in essentially the same way,
with perhaps only minor differences in parameter settings between
whole molecules and fragments.
Downstream MOE applications do not differentiate between fragments and
whole molecules; for example, Pharmacophore Search
takes as input any 3D structure database.
</p>

<p>
The raw input data used to generate a 3D structure database
typically originates from Molecular Design Ltd. (MDL)
Structure Data (SD) files,
a popular ASCII (text) format for storing moderately large numbers of
small molecules (ligands) along with associated data fields.
The data source can also be
a text file of <a href="molsystems/smiles.htm">SMILES</a>
strings or a <a href="../mdb/db.htm">MOE database</a>.
This document describes how to prepare SDF input data using
MOE's SD tools.  The SD tools can be run in batch mode
and in parallel to maximize efficient use of resources.
</p>

A typical SD data preparation workflow using MOE is as follows:
</p>

<p>
<ol>

<p><li>
<i>Eliminate uninterpretable records.</i>
The first stage of preparing SD data eliminates illegal
or unrecognized molecules.
Abbreviations are translated and molecules with unrecognized atoms
or formats are rejected.
Molecules may also be screened to remove transition metals
or atoms with too many bonds.
</li></p>

<p><li><i>Enumerate tautomers and stereoisomers.</i>
In the next stage, the molecules, which are now
assumed to be correct and of standard form, can be enumerated
for tautomeric, protomeric, and stereochemical states,
and filtered in preparation for fragmentation or conformation generation.
</li></p>

<p><li><i>Perform fragmentation, if required.</i>
If fragment databases are the goal, then the molecules are
fragmented, possibly with a variety of fragmentation algorithms.
For a detailed example of how to prepare a fragment database,
please refer to the
<a href="../tutorials/sdfrag_tut.htm">Small Molecule Fragmentation
Using SD Tools Tutorial</a>.
</li></p>

<p><li><i>Generate conformations.</i>
Conformational search is performed using MOE's fast conformation
generator,
<a href="../apps/confgui.htm">Conformation Import</a>.
Typical operations on 3D structure databases include
3D searching (<a href="../apps/ph4_guide.htm">Pharmacophore Search</a>)
and <a href="../apps/docking.htm">docking</a>, both of which
require conformations.
Although MOE's Pharmacophore Search and
Dock applications can generate conformations automatically,
explicit conformation generation in the data preparation
stage has the benefit of better control over which
conformers are produced.
</li></p>

<p><li><i>Filter conformations.</i>
It may be desirable or necessary to further filter the generated
conformations, possibly with a variety of filtering techniques.
</li></p>

</ol>
</p>

<p>
<span class="tip">Note:</span>
The SD file format is primarily intended for small molecules.
Note that residue and chain information is not encoded in SD files.
</p>

<a name="Parallel_Processing"></a>
<h3>Parallel Processing</h3>

<p>The raw input data may originate from a variety sources,
including proprietary corporate databases and commercially
available drug catalogs, some of which may be very large,
possibly comprising millions of compounds.
To reduce computation time, the input can be processed in parallel
on a cluster, either by partitioning the input explicitly into
pieces, or by dint of pipes.
</p>

<!-- !!! Partitioning !!! -->

<p>There are two straightforward ways in which data preparation
can be run in parallel on a cluster of machines:
</p>

<p>
<ul>

<p>
<li>Use <i>pipes</i>.  These are buffers that can be written
to by one process and read from by another asynchronously.  Because
they are managed by the computer operating system, pipes are
simple to use.  Processing, however, is limited to the CPUs on one computer.
On the shell command line, under both Unix and
Windows, the symbol for a pipe is the vertical bar &quot;<b>|</b>&quot;
and represents linking the output of one process to the input of the next.
The operation of chaining
several processes together using pipes is called <i>pipelining</i>.
</li>
</p>

<p>
<li>
Partition the data into chunks and process each separately.
In this mode, the chunks are processed on different machines which
run in parallel.
On each machine, a chunk can itself be processed in parallel using
the pipelining technique described above.
</li>
</p>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<b>Token use.</b>
<a href="../install/install.htm#RunBatch">MOE/batch</a> consumes
one license token (graphical MOE consumes three).
When using pipes, the number of tokens in use
will be equal to or less than the number of processes pipelined together
(a computational bottleneck may delay the onset of downstream
processes, for example, resulting in fewer processes running concurrently).
When using partitioned data, the number
of tokens is equal to the number of machines being used, multiplied
by the number of processes on each machine.
</p>

<p>The Conformation Import application is configured for
distributed (parallel) processing.  Thus, if MOE or MOE/batch is run with
<a href="hellomoe.htm#Multi-Processor">multi-processor mode</a> enabled,
i.e. if <tt>moe</tt> or <tt>moebatch</tt> was invoked with the
<a class="svl" href="../install/install.htm#-mpu">-mpu</a>
command-line switch, Conformation Import will automatically
distribute its workload among the computers of the designated
cluster.  More on this topic will be given
below in the section on
<a href="#Using_MOE_Conformation_Import">Using MOE Conformation Import</a>.
</p>

<a name="SD_Tools"></a>
<h2>SD Tools</h2>

<p>
MOE's
<a href="../apps/sdtools.htm">SD tools</a>
are intended for use in batch mode, either
in <a href="../install/install.htm#RunBatch">MOE/batch</a>
or directly at the system shell command line (in which case
MOE/batch is invoked automatically).
For example, <tt>sdfrag</tt>
can be run using the following commands
(assuming the command shell <tt>cmd.exe</tt>
is being used to process commands on Windows):
</p>

<blockquote>
    <tt>unix&nbsp;%&nbsp;$MOE/bin/sdfrag</tt>
    <b>{</b> <i>option</i> | <i>inputfilename</i> | @<i>filename</i> <b>}*</b>
    <br />
    <br />

    <tt>C:\&gt;&nbsp;%MOE%\bin\sdfrag</tt>
    <b>{</b> <i>option</i> | <i>inputfilename</i> | @<i>filename</i> <b>}*</b>
</blockquote>

<p>These commands assume that the shell
<a href="../install/install.htm#RunEnv">environment variable</a>
<tt>MOE</tt> has been set.  For explicit instructions about setting
this environment variable, please refer to the 
<a href="../tutorials/sdfrag_tut.htm#Preparing_Environment">Small
Molecule Fragmentation Using SD Tools Tutorial</a>.
</p>

<h4>Summary of SD Tools</h4>

<p>MOE's SD tools
all operate by reading and concatenating the input files,
performing the calculations, then writing output records
to an output SD file.
</p>

<ul>
<p><li><a class="svl" href="fcnref/sdwash.htm">sdwash</a>.
Provides a variety of washing options including
removal of extraneous salts, enumeration of
tautomeric and protonation states, saving of a SMILES
representation, and adjustment of hydrogen atoms.
This tool provides functionality similar to the database
<a href="../mdb/wash.htm">Wash</a> application.

</li></p><p><li><a class="svl" href="fcnref/sdfilter.htm">sdfilter</a>.
Applies a series of filters to each input molecule, including:

<p>
    <ul>
    <li>Range filters, applied to molecular descriptors that are
    calculated automatically and/or to data fields included in the input file;
    </li><li>Lipinski's druglikeness test;
    </li><li>Oprea's leadlikeness test;
    </li><li>reactivity test.
    </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
Molecules that pass the filter tests are written to the output.
</p>

</li>
</ul>

<p>
Typically, <tt>sdwash</tt> and <tt>sdfilter</tt> are
applied prior to using the following SD tools.  <tt>sdfilter</tt>
is usually applied first to eliminate illegal records.  Then,
<tt>sdwash</tt> is applied to generate tautomers and
ionization states, followed by 
<tt>sdfilter</tt> again, which is now used to eliminate large or inorganic
or non-druglike structures.
</p>

<ul>
<p><li><a class="svl" href="fcnref/sdfrag.htm">sdfrag</a>.
Generates a fragment database from the input molecules.  This is
useful for applications such as scaffold replacement.
The input molecules can be fragmented using different
methodologies, for example,
<a href="../apps/recap.htm">RECAP</a> bond breaking or
Schuffenhauer hierarchical decomposition.

</li></p><p><li><a class="svl" href="fcnref/sdsort.htm">sdsort</a>.
Sorts the contents of the input files, possibly removing duplicate
records and merging related data fields.
Molecules can be compared based on ZQH priority, SMILES
string representation, tautomer state, and the value of
specified data fields.

</li></p><p><li><a class="svl" href="fcnref/sdstereo.htm">sdstereo</a>.
Enumerates missing atom and bond stereochemistry assignments for
each input molecule.  
The input molecules can be provided as either SD files or
ASCII files containing SMILES strings.
These annotations are needed for
certain 3D conformation generators.  Note, however, that
MOE's
<a href="../apps/confgui.htm">Conformation Import</a></span>
and
<a href="../apps/confsrch.htm">Conformational Search</a>
<i>do</i> enumerate unconstrained centers and therefore
do not require <tt>sdstereo</tt> to be run prior to being called.

</li></p><p><li><a class="svl" href="fcnref/sddesc.htm">sddesc</a>.
Calculates molecular descriptors for each input molecule and
writes the results to either an SD file or an ASCII file.

</li></p>
</ul>

<h4>Argument Processing</h4>

<p>
The input arguments to the SD tools are
processed in left-to-right order.  If an argument starts with a dash
(&quot;-&quot;) and
is of length greater than one, it (and possibly subsequent arguments) is taken
as an option specification.  For example, the following command
contains two option specifications: <tt>-strict</tt>, which
rejects any molecule containing an unrecognized atom element,
and <tt>-f</tt>, which specifies a file into which the rejected molecules
are written.

<pre>
    sdwash -strict file.sdf -f rejects.sdf
</pre>


If an argument is of the form
<a name="@filename">@<i>filename</i></a>,
then the contents of the file named <i>filename</i>
are read and inserted into the argument
stream for further argument processing.
This is useful for avoiding long command
lines or to record commonly used arguments and files.
For example (assuming Unix),

<pre>
    sdwash @$MOE/lib/sdabbrev.txt file.sdf
</pre>

reads arguments from the file <tt>sdabbrev.txt</tt> (distributed
with MOE), which contains lines such as

<pre>
    ...
    -abbrev Me=C
    -abbrev CH3=C
    -abbrev Et=CC
    ...
</pre>

for translating abbreviations.
The remaining arguments are taken to be input SD files.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> The @<i>filename</i> argument can only appear
where an option or filename would normally be processed and not as the
argument to an option (e.g. <tt>-o</tt>&nbsp;@<i>filename</i> specifies
&quot;@<i>filename</i>&quot; as the name of the output file).
</p>

<p>
The input SD files are processed in left-to-right order.
For example (assuming Unix),
<pre>    sdfrag file1.sdf file2.sdf file3.sdf
</pre>
specifies three input files: "file1.sdf", "file2.sdf" and "file3.sdf" which
will be processed in the order given.  Input files containing "*" or "?" are
interpreted as filename patterns and each will be substituted with all
filenames that match the given pattern; for example, <tt>*.sdf</tt> will be
substituted with all filenames in the current directory that have a
<tt>.sdf</tt> suffix.  <b>Note:</b> On Unix systems,
double and single quotes are
removed by the command shell.  On Windows systems, such quotes are removed by
MOE.  In both systems, filename patterns entered in quotes will be substituted
by MOE.
</p>

<p>
The input file "-" is
interpreted as <tt>stdin</tt> (for use with pipes).  For example, in the
following, <tt>sdfilter</tt> takes the output of <tt>sdwash</tt> as its input:

<pre>
    sdwash file1.sdf file2.sdf | sdfilter -
</pre>

If there are no explicit
input files then <tt>stdin</tt> is used as the single input file, so
this command can equivalently be issued as:

<pre>
    sdwash file1.sdf file2.sdf | sdfilter
</pre>

<p>
Each invocation of an SD tool is associated with
its own MOE/batch process.  When piped together and executed on
a multi-processor machine, the MOE/batch processes will be run in parallel.
</p>

<a name="Pre-Processing"></a>
<h2>Pre-Processing</h2>

<p>3D data preparation has been divided here into three main stages,
a &quot;pre-processing&quot; stage antecedent to conformational
analysis (or fragmentation analysis, not treated here),
the conformational analysis step, and a &quot;post-processing&quot;
stage in which the output conformations are filtered.
</p>

<p>This section assumes that the shell
<a href="../install/install.htm#RunEnv">environment variable</a>
<tt>MOE</tt> has been set.  For explicit instructions about setting
this environment variable, please refer to the 
<a href="../tutorials/sdfrag_tut.htm">Small Molecule Fragmentation Using
SD Tools Tutorial</a>.
</p>

<a name="Clean_the_Data"></a>
<h3>Clean the Data</h3>

<p>The data cleaning steps include removing unreadable records (e.g.
molecules with unrecognized
abbreviations or atom elements), normalizing structures (e.g.
using ionic representation for salts, conventional representation
for ylides), and eliminating structures with elements outside of
the common &quot;organic&quot; set.
Note that successive calls to <tt>sdwash</tt> and <tt>sdfilter</tt>
are made (instead of calling each only once) as certain operations
should be performed in a particular order (e.g. disconnect salts
before filtering molecules for organic elements).
</p>

<h4>Wash Input Structures</h4>

<p><tt>sdwash</tt> is used to expand abbreviations and handle salts,
bond conventions, and chirality markers. The
&quot;<tt>\</tt>&quot; (backslash) is the line continuation character on Unix,
&quot;<tt>^</tt>&quot; (caret) on Windows.
</p>

<p>
<span class="tip">Tip</span> To cut and paste the following example,
omit the prompt (i.e. do not include <tt>unix %</tt> or <tt>C:\&gt;</tt>).
On Windows, do each line separately, omitting all leading blank space.
</p>

<pre>
    <span class="nobr">unix % $MOE/bin/sdwash <i>raw_data</i>.sdf @$MOE/lib/sdabbrev.txt -strict \</span>

SD file format allows for representing
common groups by abbreviations, e.g. <tt>Me</tt> for
a methyl group or <tt>COOH</tt> for a carboxyl group.
This option uses the
<span class="switch">-abbrev</span> statements in the file
<tt>sdabbrev.txt</tt> to expand abbreviations.
Examples of statements that
appear in <tt>sdabbrev.txt</tt> are:

<pre>
    -abbrev Me=C
    -abbrev CH3=C
    -abbrev Et=CC
</pre>

Abbreviations (e.g. <tt>Et</tt>) are translated into
<a href="molsystems/smiles.htm">SMILES</a> strings (e.g. <tt>CC</tt>)
which are, in turn, converted through 2D depiction, into molecular fragments
that are appended to the SD molecule.
<br />
<br />
Note: On Unix, when using the
<span class="switch">-abbrev</span> option directly on
the command line, it may be necessary to
enclose the SMILES string in quotes (<tt>'</tt>) to avoid
interpretation by the command shell.

and takes precedence over wedge bond annotations, if any.
This option forces recalculation of wedge bonds when
the chiral parity flag is non-zero and wedge bonds are present;
wedge bonds are set in accordance with the parity flag.
The purpose of this option is to ensure
that no conflict exists between the parity flag and the wedge

<p>The input is the raw data file <tt><i>raw_data</i>.sdf</tt>.
The rejected molecules are written to the file

the file <tt>wash_pass.sdf</tt>.
</p>

<p>Note: 
The SD Tools were designed to take advantage of correctly
formatted SDF V2000 structures.  V3000 records can be processed,
but there may be some information loss.  To restrict the output
to only V2000 records, the <tt>-V2000</tt> option can be
added to the command line.

<a name="Tautomers"></a>
<h3>Enumerate Tautomers and Protonation States</h3>

<p>Hydrogen bonding interactions play a key role in molecular
recognition and ligand binding.  Many ligands have multiple tautomers
and multiple protonation states, with the energetically favored
ones in the active site possibly being different from those in the
unbound molecule.  For this reason, it is important to explore 
the various tautomeric and protonation states.
Tautomers are isomerized by migrating a single hydrogen atom along
with some number of double bonds.  Functional groups containing
polar hydrogens are enumerated by generating both the acid
(protonated) and the conjugate base (deprotonated, charged) forms.
The enumeration process is described in greater detail
in <a href="../mdb/wash.htm">Database Wash</a>.
Note: When chirally constrained atoms undergo tautomerization,
racemic mixtures may result.

<a name="Generating_Conformations"></a>
<h2>Generating Conformations</h2>

<a name="Using_MOE_Conformation_Import"></a>
<h3>Using MOE Conformation Import</h3>

<p>
MOE's <a href="../apps/confgui.htm">Conformation Import</a>
calculates low-energy conformations of molecules by decomposing
each ligand into constituent overlapping fragments, performing
stochastic conformational search on each fragment,
and then assembling the fragments into unique conformers.
The application was designed for speed and
intended for high-throughput processing of large databases.
</p>

<p>
Conformation Import can read both SD and
<a href="../mdb/db.htm">MDB</a> files, and writes MDB files.
Although Conformation Import includes its own
washing and filtering stages, it is preferable, when
processing SD files, to use the SD tools described above to perform the
washing and filtering tasks.
Not only do <tt>sdwash</tt> and <tt>sdfilter</tt> provide a greater variety
of options, they also include options exclusive to SD files.
Furthermore, Conformation Import does not have a built-in
enumeration stage, which can be provided by
<tt>sdwash</tt> and <tt>sdstereo</tt>.
</p>

<p>
<span class="tip">Note:</span>
MOE provides other
<a href="../apps/confsrch.htm">conformational search</a> methods
such as
<a href="../apps/confsrch.htm#LowModeMD">LowModeMD</a>
which operate on MOE databases or molecules loaded in MOE.
To use these methods, first
<a href="../mdb/dbio.htm">import</a> the SD data into a
MOE database or load the data directly into MOE using
<span class="menu">MOE | File | Open</span>.
</p>

<h4>Multi-Processor Mode</h4>

<p>A primary motivation for using Conformation Import is that it
will automatically run in multi-processor mode when executing in
<a href="../install/smp_inst.htm">MOE/cluster</a>.
MOE/cluster (MOE/smp) refers to a special invocation of MOE or MOE/batch made
using the <a class="svl" href="../install/install.htm#RunSwitch">-mpu</a>
command-line switch which allows MOE to run on a MOE/cluster cluster.
Running Conformation Import in multi-processor mode
requires only that the MOE/cluster cluster be configured and that MOE
or MOE/batch be invoked in multi-processor mode.
The actual invocation of Conformation Import remains the same.
For more details about MOE/cluster, please see
<a href="../install/smp_inst.htm">Installing and Running MOE/cluster</a>.
</p>

<p>
In the simplest scenario, the MOE/cluster multi-processor is specified
on a single multi-processor computer; the CPUs on that computer
become the nodes of the MOE/cluster cluster.
For example, the following will
initiate MOE on a cluster of size 2 on a dual-processor
machine (assuming the
<a href="../install/install.htm#RunEnv">environment variable</a> <tt>MOE</tt>
has been set to point to the root of the MOE installation directory tree):
</p>

<blockquote>
    <span class="nobr"><tt>unix % $MOE/bin/moe -mpu 2</tt></span>
<br />
    <span class="nobr"><tt>C:\&gt; %MOE%\bin\moe -mpu 2</tt></span>
</blockquote>

<p>or, equivalently, MOE/batch:
</p>

<blockquote>
    <span class="nobr"><tt>unix % $MOE/bin/moebatch -mpu 2</tt></span>
<br />
    <span class="nobr"><tt>C:\&gt; %MOE%\bin\moebatch -mpu 2</tt></span>
</blockquote>

<p>Here 2 refers to the cluster size.  For a computer with more
CPUs, the cluster size should be adjusted accordingly.
</p>

<p>Running on multiple machines requires a
<i>machine file</i> in which the nodes
of the cluster are specified.
Each machine in the
cluster must have been configured for remote execution and be able
to locate and run MOE.  This configuration usually needs to be
done only once.  For more details, please see
<a href="../install/smp_inst.htm">Installing and Running MOE/cluster</a>.
The following will initiate MOE on a multiple-machine cluster using
the machine file <tt>machine.txt</tt>:
</p>

<blockquote>
    <span class="nobr"><tt>unix % $MOE/bin/moe -mpu machine.txt</tt></span>
<br />
    <span class="nobr"><tt>C:\&gt; %MOE%\bin\moe -mpu machine.txt</tt></span>
</blockquote>

<p>and similarly for MOE/batch:</p>

<blockquote>
    <span class="nobr"><tt>unix % $MOE/bin/moebatch -mpu machine.txt</tt></span>
<br />
    <span class="nobr"><tt>C:\&gt; %MOE%\bin\moebatch -mpu machine.txt</tt></span>
</blockquote>

<!--

<h4>Running in MOE/batch</h4>

<p>Conformation Import can be run in MOE/batch using the command line
invocation of the application <tt>conf_Import</tt>.
A complete list of options is displayed when Conformation Import is run,
either at the command line or in graphical MOE.
For example, in MOE/batch, the following will cause all
options with their default values to be displayed:
</p>

<pre>
    moe> conf_Import []
</pre>

<p>To pipeline Conformation Import, <tt>moebatch</tt> can be invoked with
the <a class="svl" href="../install/install.htm#-exec">-exec</a>
command-line switch.  For example (Unix),
</p>

<pre>
    unix&gt; $MOE/bin/moebatch -exec "conf_Import []"
</pre>

<p>will cause <tt>moebatch</tt> to run Conformation Import with the
specified options and then terminate.  To also run in multi-processor
mode, simply append the appropriate <tt>-mpu</tt> switch, e.g.
</p>

<pre>
    unix&gt; $MOE/bin/moebatch -exec "conf_Import []" -mpu 2
</pre>

<p>An example of the calling sequence of <tt>conf_Import</tt> which could be
used in a script (batch file) is as follows:
</p>

<p border="1" margin="10px">
<pre>
    conf_Import [
	input_file1, input_file2, ..., input_filen,
	...
    ];
</pre>
</p>

<h4>Running in MOE</h4>
-->

<h4>Running Conformation Import</h4>

<p>
Conformation Import can be run from graphical MOE
by choosing <span class="menu">MOE | Compute | Pharmacophore |
<a href="../apps/confgui.htm">Conformation Import</a></span>.
If MOE was invoked on a MOE/cluster cluster, Conformation Import
will run automatically in multi-processor mode.

<a name="Using_Omega"></a>
<h3>Using Omega</h3>

<p>Omega is a conformation generator obtainable under license from
<a href="http://www.eyesopen.com">OpenEye Scientific Software</a>.
Both SD and SMILES are among the accepted input formats.
The output files can be generated in a variety of formats,
including SD; the OpenEye binary (OEB) format, however, is the 
recommended one, and is the format recognized by MOE's Pharmacophore
Search application.  OEB files have extension <tt>.oeb</tt>, and
can also be generated in <a href="http://www.gzip.org">gzip</a>ped form
(this is the recommended output format), with extension <tt>.oeb.gz</tt>.
</p>

<h4>Setting Up the Omega Environment</h4>

<p>Assuming Omega is already installed, the
</p>

<blockquote>
    <tt>$OE_DIR</tt> (Unix)
<br />
    <tt>%OE_DIR%</tt> (Windows)
</blockquote>

<p>environment variable is expected to point to the top of the
OpenEye installation directory tree.
For running with Pharmacophore Search, a utility
is used to convert (at run-time) the OEB data
into SD format with
a special convention for conformation and energy encoding.
The converter should be located either in the OE <tt>bin</tt>
subdirectory:
</p>

<blockquote>
    <tt>$OE_DIR/bin</tt> (Unix)
<br />
    <tt>%OE_DIR%\bin</tt> (Windows)
</blockquote>

<p>or in one of the directories listed in the
</p>

    <tt>$PATH</tt> (Unix)
<br />
    <tt>%PATH%</tt> (Windows)

<p>environment variable.</p>

<p>
The default converter, <tt>oeb2sdconf</tt>, is
provided by OpenEye.  If a different converter is to be used,
it must be specified by setting the MOE
<a href="fcnref/rc.htm">resource configuration</a> (RC) variable
<tt>'oe_omega'</tt>.  This can be done
from within MOE by typing at the
<a href="gui/svlcommands.htm">SVL command line</a>:

<pre>
    <a class="svl" href="fcnref/rc.htm">SetRC</a> ['oe_omega', 'my_special_oeb2sdconf']
</pre>

<p>
or by directly editing the resource configuration (RC) file
</p>

<blockquote>
    <tt>$HOME/.moe-rc</tt> (Unix)
<br />
    <tt>%HOME%\moe-rc</tt> (Windows)
</blockquote>

<p>and adding a line containing the name of the file (or the
full path if located in a directory not found in the PATH
variable),
</p>

<pre>
    oe_omega='my_special_oeb2sdconf'
</pre>

<p><span class="tip">Tip</span>
Close all open MOE and MOE/batch sessions <i>before</i> editing the RC file as
they overwrite the file on termination.

<h4>Running Omega</h4>

<p>Omega is not part of MOE and is run independently (there is
no graphical interface within MOE for invoking Omega).  An example
of how to invoke Omega at the system shell command line to read in
an SD file and output an OEB file is as follows:

<pre>
    omega -in sdfile.sdf -out omega_conf.oeb.gz
</pre>

<p>Please refer to the
<a href="http://www.eyesopen.com/docs/omega/2.3.2/html/index.html">Omega
Manual</a> for more information on running Omega and a full list of
options.</p>

<a name="Post-Processing"></a>
<h2>Post-Processing</h2>

<p>
If some knowledge of the binding properties or structure of the ligand
are known, it may be possible to filter the generated conformations
to reduce the data set.
Possible filtering methods in MOE include the following calculations:
</p>

<ul>
<p><li><a href="../quasar/descr.htm">QSAR descriptors</a>.
A wide variety of descriptors exist,
from simple &quot;counts&quot; such as number of carbons or
molecular weight, to connectivity (bonding) measures,
to surface area, volume, and energy estimates.
Descriptor value range limits can be used to filter
molecules for specific properties.

<p>A property of particular interest is given by the
<tt>rsynth</tt> descriptor, which calculates a retrosynthetic
feasibility score for a molecule.
The retrosynthetic feasibility can also be calculated directly
on molecules or databases using the SVL
<a class="svl" href="fcnref/rsynthfcn.htm">Retrosynth*</a> functions.
</p>

</li></p><p><li><a href="../quasar/model.htm">QSAR models</a>.
Linear regression and binary fit models can be calculated
from molecular descriptors and other fields to model activity.
Using such models, molecules can be screened for predicted activity.


</li></p><p><li><a href="../mdb/ph4intro.htm">Fingerprints</a>.
Fingerprints represent a set of features derived from the structure
of a molecule.  Similarity searching can yield molecules with
the desired feature set.

</li></p><p><li><a href="../apps/ph4_guide.htm">Pharmacophores</a>.
Pharmacophores are 3D models that encode the location and ligand atom type
of important binding interactions.  Pharmacophore searching relies
on accurate 3D structure, and can screen conformations for
suitable binding geometry.
</li></p>
</ul>

<p>Perhaps the simplest way in which to apply post-processing filters
is to create a <a href="../quasar/modcomp.htm">model file</a>
which can then be
<a href="../quasar/modcomp.htm#Eval">evaluated over a database</a>
(the evaluation will automatically run in parallel if MOE/cluster is enabled).
The model file is typically tuned on a small or medium-sized
data set (e.g. of known actives).  It can be as simple
as a single model weighted and thresholded, or a complex
composition of several models, combined using a custom expression.
The result of the
evaluation can be used to filter the database, for example,
by selecting database entries with <span class="menu">DBV | Edit |
<a href="../mdb/db.htm#SelectingEntries">Select</a></span>.
</p>

<a name="Appendix"></a>
<h2>Appendix: Working with Other File Formats</h2>

<p>
Although ligand data is most commonly obtained from
SDF files, there are cases where the data is in other
formats, for example, when the database is built
in MOE using one of the avaible fragment-based techniques, e.g.
<a href="../apps/breed.htm">BREED</a>,
<a href="../apps/scaffold.htm">Scaffold Replacement</a>
(including fragment linking),
<a href="../apps/recap.htm">RECAP Analysis and Synthesis</a>,
and <a href="../apps/combitools.htm">exhaustive</a> or
<a href="../apps/combitools.htm#Diverse">diverse</a>
combinatorial methods.
</p>

<p>
For 3D database preparation using MOE,
the input data must be of one of the following formats:
</p>

<p>
<center>
<table class="titlebar">
<tr>
<th>Type</th>
<th>File Extension</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>SD</td>
<td><tt>.sdf</tt></td>
<td>Molecular Design Ltd. (MDL) Structure Data (SD) file.
</tr>

<tr>
<td>SMILES</td>
<td>e.g. <tt>.txt</tt></td>
<td>Text (ASCII) file of
of <a href="molsystems/smiles.htm">SMILES</a> strings.
</tr>

<tr>
<td>MDB</td>
<td><tt>.mdb</tt></td>
<td><a href="../mdb/db.htm">MOE database</a>.
</tr>

</table>
</center>
</p>

<p>As described above, SD data can be processed directly using MOE's SD tools.
SMILES can be accepted directly into some SD tools, but
should otherwise be imported into a MOE database.

<p>MOE databases can be prepared in MOE directly, or can be exported
to SD format and processed as SD files.  The advantage of processing
in SD format is that the computations are easily performed in
batch mode using MOE's SD tools.  The output from one tool are
piped as input into the next tool, in a simple processing cascade,
described in more detail in the sections to follow.  The advantage of
processing directly on MOE databases is that the results of the
processing steps can be immediately examined.

<p>
For ligands stored as a MOE database, the
<span class="menu">DBV | Compute | Molecule</span>
menu invokes applications for cleaning and refining compounds.
Washing is a desirable step prior to such operations
as conformation enumeration or docking.
Energy minimization (geometry optimization)
is often necessary when importing molecules, for example
from SD files which typically supply molecules
with 2D coordinates only, or when converting from
SMILES strings to 3D structures.
The applications are typically used in the order in which
they are listed here:
</p>

</p>

<ol>

<p>
<li><a href="../mdb/wash.htm"><b>Wash</b></a>.
Removes extraneous salts, enumerates
tautomers and protonation states, and adjusts hydrogen atoms.

</li></p><p><li>
<a href="pot.htm#Charge"><b>Partial Charges</b></a>.
Calculates partial charges according to the selected forcefield.
This application can also adjust hydrogen and lone pair counts.
Partial charges are required for energy minimization.

</li></p><p><li>
<a href="../apps/emin.htm#DBMin"><b>Energy Minimize</b></a>.
Opens the Database Minimize application for
energy minimizing the compounds in the database.
As an alternative to minimization,
Database Minimize also allows
the external program Corina to be used instead to
generate the atomic coordinates.
Database Minimize can also add hydrogens and calculate partial
charges, and can be used to generate 2D depictions.

</li></p><p><li>
<a href="../apps/confsrch.htm"><b>Conformational Search</b></a>.
Generates conformations using systematic, stochastic, or
low-mode methodologies.

</li></p><p><li>
<a href="../apps/confsrch.htm#Superposing"><b>Conformation Geometry:
Superposition</b></a>.
Superposes the molecules in a database.

</li></p><p><li>
The <span class="menu">MOE | Compute | Conformations |
<a href="../apps/confgui.htm">Conformation Import</a></span>
application generates low-energy conformations of databases
of molecules.  An initial configurable washing and filtering stage
precedes conformation generation.  Conformations are generated by
decomposing
each ligand into constituent overlapping fragments each of
whose conformations are stochastically searched and then
assembled into unique conformations.
