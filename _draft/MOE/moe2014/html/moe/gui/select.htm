<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
The Atom Selector and Residue Selector panels 
offer an extensive array of selection
controls and the ability to combine selections using logical
operators.  These panels may be called into play when the
built-in menu commands of the
the <a href="mainwin.htm#Selecting">MOE Window</a> and
<a href="se.htm#SelectingMolecularObjects">Sequence Editor</a>
are insufficient.  For basic selection tasks, the
MOE and SE menu commands provide a variety of
pre-defined atom and residue selection commands such as
ligand and pocket atom selection, atom selection
by element, chirality, and protein properties,
or chain, residue, and child atom selection with given properties.
The Atom Selector panel additionally supports such
selection criteria as
ring connectivity, atom name, accessibility, and pharmacophoric
type, among others, and the Residue Selector panel such
criteria as amino acid classes and pattern matching.
Additional flexibility is gained through the use of named sets,
which are collections of molecular objects identified by a unique name.
Both panels support the use of such sets.
</p>


<a name="Named_Sets"></a><a name="NamedSets"></a><h2>Named Sets</h2>

<p>In MOE, molecular data can be managed as named
sets or <i>collections</i>.  A collection comprises any mixture of atom,
residue, and chain keys, and has a unique associated name.  The selection
panels allow named sets to be manipulated using the <b>Named Set</b>
field.  In the <b>Atom Selector</b> only atom keys will be added to
a named set and in the <b>Residue Selector</b> only residue keys will
be added to a named set.  The atom set further allows for 10 predefined
sets to be created.
</p>

<p>Named sets are displayed in three locations in the selection panels.</p>
<ol type="i">
<li><b>The option menu at the top</b>.
<p><img src="select/aset.png" alt="Atom Selection" />
</p>

<p>These menus define the set of objects to be included in the selection
operations.  If any named sets are defined then they will appear in the
menu.  When chosen, only the objects (and child objects) in the chosen set
will be used for the selection.
</p>
</li>
<li><b>The shortcut menu in the <b>Named Set</b> text field</b>.
<p><img src="select/namedset.png" alt="Named Set" /></p>

<p>The <b>Named Set</b> field is used to create new or overwrite
existing sets.  The shortcut will show any currently named sets.
</p></li>
<li><b>The <b>Sets:</b> menu in the selection button area</b>.
<p><img src="select/sets.png" alt="Sets" /></p>

<p>The <b>Sets</b> menu located among the selection buttons of the panel
is used to operate on the objects in the set itself.  The operation
performed will depend on the <i>defined set</i> and the <i>operation</i>
chosen.
</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Named sets are stored with the system and will be reinstated when
the molecule file is reopened.
Empty sets are not allowed, thus, creating a named set with no objects
is equivalent to deleting the set from the system.
</p>

<a name="Defining_the_Selection_Set"></a><a name="DefinedSet"></a><h2>Defining the Selection Set</h2>

<p>The Atom Selector and Residue Selector panels generally operate
on a restricted set of atoms or residues called the <i>defined object
set</i>.  When a button is pressed, only the objects (or child objects)
will be used.  If, say, a selection of all
Carbon atoms is chosen, only those carbon atoms located in the defined set
will be operated upon.
</p>

<p>Defining this restricted set is done through the options at the top
of the panel using a combination of the option menu and the checkboxes.
The intersection of all chosen restrictions will define the set.
</p>

<a name="The_Defined_Atom_Set"></a><a name="AtomSet"></a><h4>The Defined Atom Set</h4>

<p>The defined atom set is specified by the following controls:
</p>

<blockquote>
<table>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>All Atoms</b></td>
<td valign="top">Include all atoms in the system.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Selected Residues</b></td>
<td valign="top">Restrict operations to atoms whose parent residue is
selected.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Named Set</b></td>
<td valign="top">Restrict operations to atoms in the set or to child
atoms of residue and chain objects in the set.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Selected Chains</b></td>
<td valign="top">Restricts operations to atoms 
whose parent chain is selected.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Visible Atoms</b></td>
<td valign="top">Restricts operations to visible atoms.
</td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>If all checkboxes are turned off and <b>All Atoms</b> is specified
then the defined atom set is all the atoms in the system.
</p>

<a name="The_Defined_Residue_Set"></a><a name="ResidueSet"></a><h4>The Defined Residue Set</h4>

<p>The defined residue set is specified using the following controls:
</p>

<blockquote>
<table>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>All Chains</b></td>
<td valign="top">Include all residues in all chains.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Selected Chains</b></td>
<td valign="top">Restricts operations to residues 
whose parent chain is selected.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Named Set</b></td>
<td valign="top">Restricts operations to residues in the set and to 
child residues of chain objects in the set.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Residues with<br />Visible Atoms</b></td>
<td valign="top">Restricts operations to residues with at least one
atom visible in the MOE Window.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Nonempty Residues</b></td>
<td valign="top">Restricts operations to residues with at least one atom.</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>If all checkboxes are turned off and
<b>All Residues</b> is chosen, then the defined residue set is
all the residues in the system.
</p>

<a name="The_Selection_Operation"></a><a name="Operation"></a><h2>The Selection Operation</h2>

<p>In both selection panels,
the <b>Operation</b> radio buttons are used to combine consecutive selections.
</p>

<blockquote>
<table>
<tr>
<td valign="top">
<b>or</b> 
</td><td valign="top">
Add the objects satisfying the new criteria to the current selection set.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">
<b>and</b> 
</td><td valign="top">
Select the intersection between the objects satisfying
the new criteria and the previous selection set.  
Deselect any objects not in this set.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">
<b>deselect</b> 
</td><td valign="top">
Deselect the objects satisfying the new criteria.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">
<b>replace</b> 
</td><td valign="top">
Clear the current selection and replace it
with the objects satisfying the new criteria.
</td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<h2>The Atom Selector</h2>

<p>The Atom Selector allows complex selection operations to be performed
on sets of atoms.
From this panel you can perform logical operations on selection sets, as
well as select atoms based on specific properties, substructure or
proximity.
The Atom Selector is opened from the MOE Window
<a href="sel_ui.htm">Selection Prompter</a>.
Choose
<blockquote> 
<span class="menu">MOE | Select | Selector</span>
</blockquote> 
and in the Selection Prompter interface, press the <b>UI</b> button.
The following panel will open:
</p>

<center><p><img src="select/aselect.png" alt="Atom Selector" />
</p></center>

<p>The buttons to the right of the <b>Atom</b> definition controls
operate upon the defined atom set, as follows:
</p>

<blockquote>
<table>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>All</b></td>
<td valign="top">Select all atoms within the defined atom set.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>Clear</b></td>
<td valign="top">Deselect all atom within the defined atom set.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>Fixed</b></td>
<td valign="top">Select all fixed atoms within the defined atom set.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>Hidden</b></td>
<td valign="top">Select all hidden atoms within the defined atom set.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>Invert</b></td>
<td valign="top">Toggle the selection state of
all atom within the defined atom set.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>Visible</b></td>
<td valign="top">Select all visible atoms within the defined atom set.</td>
</tr>

</table>
</blockquote>

<p>The <b>Current Set</b> label displays the number of atoms currently
selected in the system.</p>

<p>The buttons at the bottom of the panel,
<b>View, Hide, Show</b>, operate
on the entire current selection set ignoring the
defined atom set. <b>View</b>
centers all the selected atoms in the 3D rendering area.  <b>Hide</b>
hides all the selected atoms and <b>Show</b> makes the selected atoms
visible.
</p>

<a name="Predefined_Atom_Sets"></a><a name="PredefinedAtomSets"></a><h3>Predefined Atom Sets</h3>

<p>You can save and restore up to ten different <i>system</i> atom sets
using the <b>Save Set/Load Set</b> buttons.  Loading an atom set will
restore the selection set and combine it with the previous selection set
according to the chosen logical operation.  The saved selection set
remains in memory as long as it is not overwritten.  A bold label
indicates the set currently has a value.
</p>

<a name="Atom_Selection_Buttons"></a><a name="AtomSelectionButtons"></a><h3>Atom Selection Buttons</h3>

<p>The selection buttons are grouped together based on property.
You can select by <b>Element</b>, <b>Name</b>, <b>SMILES</b>
or use a selection from one of the pages located in the pager:
<b>Accessibility</b>, <b>Chiral</b>, <b>Connectivity</b>, <b>Geometry</b>,
<b>General</b>,

<a name="The_Residue_Selector_Panel"></a><a name="ResidueSelector"><a/>
<h2>The Residue Selector Panel</h2>

<p>The Residue Selector allows the selection of residues
based on specific criteria.
Selections can be made on residue name (e.g. Alanine),
structure (e.g. helix, 4-turn), chemical class (e.g.
hydrophobic, acidic), search strings, as well as other methods.  
The selection operations permit
the intersection or union of two selection sets or entire
replacement of the current selection set.
</p>

<p>The Residue Selector is opened from the Sequence Editor
<a href="sel_ui.htm">Selection Prompter</a>.
Choose
<blockquote> 
<span class="menu">SE | Select | Selector</span>
</blockquote> 
and in the Selection Prompter interface, press the <b>UI</b> button.
The following panel will open:
</p>

<center>
<p>
<img src="select/rselect.png" alt="Residue Selector" />
</p>

will select the atoms of the currently selected residues.
</p>

<a name="Extending_the_Selection"></a><a name="Extend"></a><h3>Extending the Selection</h3>

<p>Extending a selection means expanding the current set of selected
residues according to particular rules defined by the
extend operations.  The currently selected residues are
the basis for the extend operation, and any additional residues  can only
be selected if they are within the defined residue set.
Each extend operation defines a rule that determines how additional
residues will be selected:
</p>

<a name="Residue_Selection_Operation"></a><a name="ResidueOperation"></a><h3>Residue Selection Operation</h3>

<p>In addition to setting the defined residue set, the operation may
also be changed when using any of the buttons in the <b>Select</b>
section of the panel.
</p>

<a name="Residue_Selection_Buttons"></a><a name="ResidueSelectionButtons"></a><h3>Residue Selection Buttons</h3>
<p>The buttons available for selecting and deselecting residues are
grouped into several categories as outlined in the following sections.
</p>

<a name="Selecting_by_Residue_Name"></a><a name="ResidueName"></a><h4>Selecting by Residue Name</h4>

<p>To select residues by name use the groups of buttons located in the
<b>Name</b> pager.  If none of the buttons contain the 
desired residue name, the
<b>Other</b> text field can be used to enter an arbitrary name.
The <b>Name</b> pager contains the following pages of
buttons:
</p>

<blockquote>
<table>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Amino Acid</td>
<td valign="top">
Selecting by amino acid types can be done using either the single letter
or the three letter amino acid names.  The <b>Single Letter Residues</b>
toggle controls which buttons will be shown.  Included in this list is
<b>UNK</b> for <i>unknown</i> three letter codes.  The three letter
codes correspond to the values returned by the svl function
<span class="svl">rName</span>.

<p>
The single letter codes correspond to the values returned by the
svl function <span class="svl">Seq_NameToLetter</span>.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Nucleic Acid</td>
<td> Nucleic acid residues are selected based on name alone.  
For example, if a non-nucleic

<td valign="top">
This field can be used to enter a single name which will be searched
for in the defined residue set.  
Often it is desirable to combine a residue name with its
UID value in order to more precisely specify a residue.

</table>
</blockquote>

<a name="Selecting_by_Pattern"></a><a name="Pattern"></a><h4>Selecting by Pattern</h4>

<p>Residues can be selected based on an amino acid residue search pattern.  
To do so, enter the search string,
a sequence of characters designating the sub-sequence to be found
within the current system, in the text field and press <b>Pattern</b>.
Residues matching the pattern and within the defined residue set
are selected or deselected (depending on the
Operation).  For example, the sequence <tt>gx</tt> will select all
pairs of consecutive residues in which the first residue is a glycine.
</p>

<p>The standard IUPAC one-letter codes for amino acids are used.  The
patterns are case-insensitive.
</p>

<p>Wildcards and variations of a sequence can be specified using the
following characters:

<a name="Selecting_a_Range"></a><a name="Range"></a><h4>Selecting a Range</h4>

<p>Selecting a range of columns can be done quite easily directly
in the Sequence Editor by using the columns headers and the
<tt>Shift</tt>-click keystroke to extend a range.  This, however,
will select <i>all</i> the residues within the specified columns.
Using the <b>Range</b> field in the Residue Selector, the residues
can be restricted and the operation can be varied.
</p>

<p>The range is used to specify multiple residues,
not necessarily consecutive.
Multiple values are entered separated by blanks or commas.
Ranges are specified by separating two numbers
with a hyphen (-).  The range is expanded to include all integer values
in-between the two numbers.
</p>

<p>Three buttons are available to use on the specified range:
</p>

<blockquote>
<table>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Pos</b></td>
<td>The residue position (column number) is determined by the SVL function
<span class="svl">rPos</span>.  
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Index</b></td>
<td>
The residue index is determined by the SVL function <span class="svl">rNumber</span>.
This is the index of the residue in its parent chain.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>UID</b></td>
<td>
The residue UID is determined by the SVL function <span class="svl">rUID</span>
(an integer typically equal to the ID field in PDB files).
</td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<a name="Selecting_by_Scalar"></a><a name="Scalar"></a><h4>Selecting by Scalar</h4>

<p>Residues can be selected based on their scalar values.  The
sliders below the buttons allow a range to be specified.  
</p>

<center>
<p>
<img src="select/scalar.png" alt="Scalar" />
</p>
</center>

<p>Set the desired range and then press one of the scalar buttons.  Note
that the name on the buttons will change automatically when the scalar is
recalculated.
</p>

<a name="Selecting_by_Atom_Data"></a><a name="Data"></a><h4>Selecting by Atom Data</h4>

<p>The <b>Atom Data</b> page has
functions to select residues based on their internal atom data.
For example, selecting by atom data can be used to discover residues that
should be deleted prior to attempting a homology model.
</p>

<blockquote>
<table>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Missing Atoms</td>
<td valign="top">Nonempty amino acid residues with
one or more standard atoms missing.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Incomplete Backbone</td>
<td valign="top">Nonempty amino acid residues with
one or more standard backbone atoms missing.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Nonstandard Atom Names</td>
<td valign="top">
Nonempty amino acid residues with
one or more atoms with nonstandard names.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">No Atoms</td>
<td valign="top">
Amino acid residues with no atoms.
</td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>


<a name="Class"></a>
<a name="Selecting_by_Amino_Acid_Functional_Class"></a><h4>Selecting by Amino Acid Functional Class</h4>

<p>Residues can be selected based on their amino acid functional classes.
The following table gives the amino acids associated with each class:
</p>

<blockquote>
<table>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Hydrophobic:</td>
<td valign="top">VAL, ILE, LEU, MET, TRP, PHE, TYR, ALA</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top">Hydrophilic:</td>
<td valign="top">SER, THR, ASN, GLN, ASP, GLU, ARG, LYS, HIS</td>

<td valign="top">Aromatic:</td>
<td valign="top">PHE, TYR, HIS, TRP</td>
</tr>

</table>
</blockquote>


<a name="Selecting_by_Structure"></a><a name="Structure"></a><h4>Selecting by Structure</h4>


<p>To select residues based on their underlying structure, use the
<b>Secondary Structure</b> or <b>DSSP Label</b> pages.  The
SVL function <span class="svl">rActualSegment</span> is used to determine these
residues.  
</p>

<blockquote>
<table>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Helix:</td>
<td valign="top">3-10-helix, 3-10-helix-left, helix,
helix-left, pi-helix, pi-helix-left
</td></tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top">Sheet:
</td>
<td valign="top">strand, anti-strand
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Turn:
</td>
<td valign="top">3-turn, 4-turn, 5-turn
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">None:</td>
<td valign="top">residues whose <span class="svl">rActualSegment</span> token is 'none'.
</td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<a name="Selecting_by_Ribbon_Mode"></a><a name="Ribbon"></a><h4>Selecting by Ribbon Mode</h4>
<p>The <b>Ribbon Style</b> page buttons identify residues whose
ribbon mode is set to the specified token as determined by the
SVL function <span class="svl">rRibbonMode</span>.  Whether or not the ribbon is currently
drawn in the MOE Window does not affect these buttons.
</p>

<a name="Selecting_by_Residue_Type"></a><a name="Type"></a><h4>Selecting by Residue Type</h4>
<p>There are four buttons available on the <b>Residue Type</b> page
allowing the selection of specific kinds of residues. The residue types
identified are: 
<b>Amino Acid</b> (as determined by the SVL function <span class="svl">rType</span>), 
<b>Nucleic Acid</b> (as determined by the SVL function <span class="svl">rType</span>), 
<b>Salts &amp; Solvent</b> (waters and some simple ions, i.e. PO3,
PO4, SO3, SO4), and <b>Ligand</b>.  A ligand is defined as a residue that
is not a solvent, not an amino acid and not a nucleic acid yet has more
than one atom (i.e. none of the above types).
