<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
The System Manager provides information and control over
the systems currently loaded in MOE.  It is raised as a popup using
<span class="menu">MOE | RHS | System</span> or
<span class="menu">MOE | Popup | System</span>.
Alternatively, it can be opened as a persistent window using
<span class="menu">MOE | Window | System Manager</span>,
either attached to the
right side of the MOE Window or as a separate detached window.
From the popup, the System Manager can also be made persistent by
pressing the <b>Attach</b> or <b>Detach</b> buttons
in the popup footer.<br>  The attached System Manager can be
detached using the <b>Detach</b> button in the footer.
The separate System Manager window can be attached using the
<b>Attach</b> button in the footer.
The attached/detached state is remembered for the next
time the System Manager is opened.

The System Manager provides quick access to:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Visibility of atoms and surfaces.
<li>Active, inert and selected state of atoms (independent of visibility).
<li>Coloring and rendering mode of atoms and ribbons.
<li>Creation of molecular and interaction quick surfaces.
<li>Render style, transparency, material, and  coloring of surfaces.
<li>Names of chains and chain groupings (tags, groups, sets).
</ul>

Additionally, the System Manager also allows one to:
<ul>
<li>Browse visually ligand, solvent, and receptors.
<li>Reorder tag groups.
<li>Reorder ligand lines within tags.
<li>Merge tags and move Receptor/Ligand/Solvent lines between tags.
<li>Assign new chain tags and chain groups.
<li>Find and mark lines with a string search.
<li>Find and mark ligands with a descriptor or SMILES search.
<li>Delete surfaces, grouped atoms, and sets.
</ul>


<p>The System Manager presents a multifunctional list of the
molecular objects loaded in MOE.
In MOE, molecular objects are arranged in a hierarchy: the <i>system</i> is
a sequence of <i>chains</i> each of which is a sequence of <i>residues</i>
each of which is a sequence of <i>atoms</i>.  Generally speaking, the
chains correspond to the chains of proteins and residues to the amino acids.
Small molecules are generally confined to one residue (although not required).
Multiple small molecules (ligand or solvent) are often collected into
a single chain (to preserve PDB chain identifiers for example).
Each chain has an associated chain <i>name</i> and chain <i>tag</i>.
The tag is used to group chains (such as all chains from a specific PDB file).
The name is used to hold the chain letter and other name information.
An additional organizational grouping is the <i>group</i>, which
collects chains of different tags.  A <i>named set</i> may
be used to represent an arbitrary collection of chains,
residues, and atoms.
</p>

<p>The System Manager is composed of a list of lines corresponding to
groups (boldfaced, colored purple), sets (boldfaced, colored orange),
chain tags (boldfaced) or collections of atoms (non-boldfaced) listed
beneath the group, set, or tag lines;
these lines can be hidden or shown in the list
(collapsed or expanded).  Group lines operate on all tag lines,
chains, residues, and atoms in the group.  Similarly,
tag lines operate on all chains, residues and
atoms in the tag. Non-tag lines operate on the corresponding collection
of atoms (Receptor, Ligand, etc.).
</p>

<p>Within a tag group there are three different main classes of lines in the
System Manager list: <b>Receptor</b>, <b>Solvent</b>, and <b>Ligand</b>.
If the system has dummy atoms they are grouped in additional
<b>Other</b> lines (one per each chain with dummy atoms).
In the default list view mode there is only one <b>Receptor</b>
and one <b>Solvent</b> line per tag group, even if the receptor and solvent
molecules are spread over multiple chains. Distinct ligand chains on
the other hand are listed as multiple <b>Ligand</b> lines. There is also an
extended list view mode, in which multiple receptor and solvent
chains in a tag group are split into separate <b>Receptor</b> and
<b>Solvent</b> lines, and every ligand molecule is listed in its own
<b>Ligand</b> line.
The button to switch between the default basic and extended list view
is located in the footer of the System Manager popup/window. Its state
is remembered for the next time the System Manager is opened:

</p>

<p>
If there is more than one tag group loaded in MOE, then an additional
<b>System</b> header line is available which operates on all objects
regardless of tag or group associations.
The scope of the System header line can be reduced by pressing
the double arrow <b>&lt; &gt;</b> in the System button
of the System header line.
Successive presses will cycle through different modes of operation
in which the header line affects just
<b>Receptor</b>, <b>Solvent</b>, <b>Ligand</b>, <b>Other</b>,
or <b>Marked</b> lines, depending on what is present in the system.

controls the visibility <i>and</i> activity state of the atoms it represents.
Group and tag lines affect all atoms in the group/tag while the other
non-tag lines only affect the associated atoms.
A colored (blue) background on the line indicates that at least one atom
or ribbon segment is visible. A gray background on the line indicates
that no atoms or ribbons are visible.
Showing a line makes it active; hiding a line makes it inert (inactive).
Keyboard modifiers affect the behavior:
<ul>
<li><b><tt>&lt;Shift&gt;</tt></b>.  Toggles the visibility <i>without
affecting the active/inert</i> state.
<li><b><tt>&lt;Ctrl&gt;</tt></b>.  Hides and Deactivates all other atoms in the

Clicking on the lower right corner of the named button opens a popup
window to change the <b>Group</b>, <b>Tag</b>, or chain <b>Name</b>.
In group lines, only the group name can be set for all its associated
tags and chains. In a tag line, the group and tag name are settable for
all its descendant chains. Non-tag lines allow additionally to set
the chain name (displayed on the named button for ligands,
and displayed for other chains when the full expansion mode is turned on).
<p>
For non-tag lines, setting a new tag or group will change the grouping:
If the new tag name is the same as the tag group below or above,
the line will be moved to that tag, otherwise a new tag is created.
If the new group is the same as an already existing group, the line is
merged into that existing group.
</p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> Setting a new <b>Group</b>, <b>Tag</b>, or <b>Name</b> can
cause new chains to be created in MOE; for example, if two ligands are in
the same chain and only one of them is renamed.
</p>
In <b>Set</b> lines only the set name can be changed.  Choosing the name of
an existing set will merge the sets.  An empty set name
will delete the named set.

<h2>Browse System</h2>

<p>
With the System Manager, it is easy to analyze and compare complex systems.
In docking experiments, one often has a single receptor structure
loaded, and desires to browse through a series of docked ligands,
possibly also comparing each docked ligand to a reference ligand structure.
With a <tt>&lt;Ctrl&gt;</tt>-click onto the named button of a ligand line only
that ligand becomes visible and all others are hidden.
</p>

<p>
<div class="floatright">
<img src="system/sys_footer.png" alt="System Manager Footer" />
</div>
For large numbers of ligands, the footer of
the System Manager has a next and previous arrow button to step
through all the ligands loaded in MOE. The <b>RSL</b> button
next to the arrow buttons opens a popup in which one can specify
whether the arrow  buttons step through the ligand, solvent or receptor
lines of the System Manager list.  If <b>Receptor</b>,
<b>Solvent</b>, and <b>Ligand</b> are all activated, the arrow buttons
step through entire tag groups (equivalent to <tt>&lt;Ctrl&gt;</tt>-click
on the tag lines). A <tt>&lt;Shift&gt;</tt>-click onto an arrow button
jumps to the first or last list entry.
Alternatively, one can use the <tt>Up</tt> and <tt>Down</tt> arrow keys
on the keyboard to step through the system.
</p>
<p>
By default, the expansion state of the tags and groups is not changed
during browsing. To automatically expand tags of browsed structures,
<tt>&lt;Ctrl&gt;</tt>-click on the arrow buttons.
</p>

<p>
In order to keep one or more ligand lines visible during the
ligand browsing, for reference comparisons, one has to make sure that the lines
are visible but inactive before browsing. These lines will then not
be included in the browsing and the associated structures will be kept visible.
The same applies to receptor browsing.

<h2>Reorder and Organize System</h2>

<p>
It is possible to reorder the members of groups and tags in the System Manager
with the mouse. In order to move an entire tag group, select
the tag line with the mouse, and then press and hold the
middle mouse button. A red rectangle appears around the tag line,
indicating that it will be moved. To select the target of the move
operation, continue to hold the middle mouse button and drag the mouse
cursor to the list location where the tag should be moved to.
While dragging, a red line will indicate the currently selected target.
To move the tag, the destination must be between two tags.
If the target is within a tag itself (receptor, solvent, ligand
lines), then it is assumed that a merge of the source tag with the
destination tag is requested. Once the middle mouse button is released,
the move or merge is performed. In the case of a merge request, a
confirmation panel will pop up.
</p>

<p>Similarly, groups can be reordered and merged.
To move an entire group, select the group line and drag it to
the desired position.  If the target location is within a group,
a group merge action is possible, in which a confirmation dialog
will open.
</p>

<p>
Receptor, solvent, or ligand lines can be moved between
tags or groups using the middle mouse button in the same manner.
Such a move and merge operation will also pop up a confirmation
panel before the merge is performed.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> Similarly to setting a new <b>Group</b>,
new <b>Tag</b>, or new <b>Name</b>,
moving a single non-tag line can cause new chains to be created in MOE:
for example, if two ligands are in the same chain and one of the ligands
is moved.
</p>

<p>
If a tag has multiple ligand lines (or multiple receptor/solvent lines
in expanded-list mode) the ligand lines can be reordered within the
group by dragging them with the middle mouse as described above.
<b>Note:</b> The order of the classes within the tag
(1. Receptor, 2. Solvent, 3. Ligand, 4. Other) cannot be changed,
only the order of lines within its own class. 
</p>


<p>The System Manager also displays any named sets that exist
in the system.  The set name can be edited in the popup
raised by pressing the lower right corner. The sets lines are always sorted
alphabetically.
</p>

<p>A <b>Group By</b> option is now available in <b>System Manager | Popup</b>
when grouping is available. Grouping can be set by delimiting group names using
braces { } in chain headers.
</p>

<h2>Search System</h2>

<div class="floatright">
<img src="system/sys_searchline.png" height="30px" alt="Search Line" />
</div>

<p>
The leftmost button in the footer is the <b>Search</b>
<img src="system/sys_search.png" alt="Search" /> button. It pops
up a text search line. The entered text phrase will be searched within the
chain names, groups, and tags of the System Manager list lines.
Lines associated with matching structures are marked with blue text.
Collapsed groups or tags with marked lines are automatically expanded.
Repeated search for the same text string will
show the next matching line with a temporary blue rectangle and scroll
the list if needed to make the line visible.
</p>
<p>
Marked text can be assigned to a group name by pressing the <b>Group</b>
<img src="system/sys_group_button.png" alt="Group" /> button. This opens
a dialog box where a name for the group can be entered. After clicking 
<b>OK</b>, the grouped items will appear under the name of the group in
the System Manager panel. Grouped items can be searched in the search line
via <tt>group=<i>pattern</i></tt>.

<img src="system/SysMan_group3.png" width="200px" alt="Groups in System Manager" />
</div>
<div style="clear: both;"></div>

<p>
The search also accepts
<a href="../../quasar/fcnref/descrfcn.htm#DescriptorExprSyntax">
QuaSAR descriptor expressions</a> and
<a href="../fcnref/smartsfcn.htm">SMARTS</a> strings; but only searches
for these in the ligand lines.
</p>
<p>
The marked state of lines can also be changed manually by pressing
<tt>&lt;Alt&gt;</tt>-click on named button. Marked lines can be
manipulated together by the system header line in <b>Marked</b> mode.
