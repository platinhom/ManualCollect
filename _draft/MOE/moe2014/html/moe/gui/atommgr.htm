<h2><a name="Using">Using the Atom Manager</a></h2>

<p>The Atom Manager is used to display and modify the properties of
molecular objects currently loaded in the <a href="mainwin.htm">MOE Window</a>. The Atom
Manager is for viewing and editing purposes only, and cannot be used to
add or delete molecular objects. </p>

<p>In the MOE Window, open the Atom Manager by choosing 
<b><span class="nobr">Window&nbsp;|&nbsp;Atom Manager</span></b>.
Double-clicking on an atom in the MOE Window also opens the
Atom Manager.  The clicked-on atom is highlighted in the Atom Manager.  </p>

<p align="center"><img src="atommgr/atommgr.png" alt="Atom Manager"> </p>


<p>The list in the upper section of the panel shows the hierarchy of
currently loaded molecular objects (chains, residues and atoms), along
with their names and properties.</p>

<p>The Selection Only and Visible Only toggle buttons confine the
list to atoms and residues that are currently selected or currently
visible in the MOE Window. Chains in the system are always listed,
regardless of their selection or visibility states. </p>


<p>To edit an object's properties, select the object in the Atom Manager.  
Only one object may be selected at a time. Fields pertaining to the
object's properties will appear below the list. Editing the
relevant field, followed by pressing <b>Apply</b> at the bottom of the panel,
will modify the properties of the object.</p>



<p><b>Important!</b> Modifications made to a molecular object will
<strong>only</strong> be recorded when <b>Apply</b> is pressed. If another
molecular object is selected before <b>Apply</b> is pressed, you will lose any
changes made. No warning is given. </p>

<p>Each chain and residue can be <i>expanded</i> to show its component
objects or <i>compressed</i> to hide its component objects.
Double-clicking on a residue or chain toggles its
expanded/compressed state. All the chains and residues in the system can
be expanded or compressed simultaneously using the Expand All and Compress
All buttons at the bottom of the panel. </p>

<p>Double-clicking on an atom in the list toggles its selection state in the
MOE Window.  </p>



<a name="Chain_Properties"></a>
<h3>Chain Properties</h3>

<p>The properties of a chain are its selection state (shown as a fletch
in the leftmost column),
number, number of associated
residues <tt>[r:]</tt>, number of associated atoms <tt>[a:]</tt>,
and name (usually the compound name).  These properties
are displayed on a single line in the Atom
Manager. The example below shows a chain named <tt>1MCT.A</tt> which
contains 223 child residues and 1642 component atoms. </p>

<p align="center">
<img src="atommgr/chainprops.png" alt="Chain Properties in Atom Manager"></p>

<p>Selecting a chain in the list displays
the properties name, tag and header which may be edited.
These properties have meaning in certain file formats, but otherwise they
may be filled according to preference; for instance, in PDB files, tag is
the 4-letter PDB code (e.g. 9INS), name is the 4-letter code
followed by a period and a letter (used if there are multiple chains with
the same code, e.g. 9INS.A), and header is the molecule name
(e.g. INSULIN). 
</p>

<p>Press <b>Apply</b> after completing the modifications for a given chain.</p>

<a name="Residue_Properties"></a>
<h3>Residue Properties</h3>

<p>The properties of a residue are its selection state (shown as a fletch
in the leftmost column), number, name, tag, UID and INS codes, and number
of associated atoms <tt>[a:]</tt>. These properties are displayed on a
single line in the Atom Manager. </p>

<p align="center">
<img src="atommgr/resprops.png" alt="Residue Properties in Atom Manager"></p>

<p>Selecting a residue in the list displays relevant residue information such as
residue name, residue type (e.g. amino acid), and the PDB UID and INS
codes. The residue name has a maximum of four characters. The residue type
may be either one of the six residue types defined in MOE (amino, l-amino,
d-amino, DNA, RNA, heme), or &quot;none&quot; if the residue type is
undefined in MOE. The UID and INS codes are indicators of a residue's
position with respect to a reference protein, and are only significant in
the context of proteins. UID is the residue sequence number, and INS is a
letter that indicates that the residue is an insertion at the position
given by UID (the default for INS is a blank space). 

<p>Press <b>Apply</b> after completing the modifications for a given residue.</p>


<a name="Atom_Properties"></a>
<h3>Atom Properties</h3>

<p>Atom properties include selection state (<b>&gt</b>),
fixed-position state (<b>F</b>),
atom name, backbone state (<b>|</b>), element,
lone-pair hint state (<b>:</b>), hybridization, partial charge
(<b>q</b>), atomic mass (<b>m</b>), molecular mechanics
forcefield atom type (<b>MM</b>) and the temperature factor (<b>B</b>,
as provided in PDB files, for example).

<p align="center">
<img src="atommgr/atomprops.png" alt="Atom Properties in Atom Manager"> </p>

<p>Selecting an atom in the list displays its relevant information in the editable
area below. You can enter or select new values for the highlighted atom
and press <b>Apply</b> to update information in the list. 

<p>Atom names, for instance, can be any
combination of up to four characters or digits. To display them in the MOE
Window, you would choose 
<span class="menu"><b>MOE | Render | Atoms | Name</b></span>.
The position of the atom can also be modified by editing
the xyz coordinates (in angstroms). An arbitrary scalar can be
assigned to the atom using the <b>Scalar</b> field.  The fixed-position,
backbone, and lone-pair hint status flags can also be altered.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> Although the ionization state, scalar and xyz coordinates
of the atom do not appear in the Atom Manager list, these values are editable in the panel. 

<p>Toggle buttons at the bottom of the panel let you turn on or off the
following properties (see picture above):

<p><table class="titlebar">
  <tr>
    <th valign="top">Property</th>
    <th valign="top">Appears as:</th>
    <th valign="top">Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">Selected</td>
    <td valign="top">fletch <b>&gt;</b> in leftmost column </td>
    <td valign="top">Atom is selected in the MOE Window.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">Fixed</td>
    <td valign="top">character <b>F</b> in the second column</td>
    <td valign="top">Fixed atoms are anchored to their current positions
and cannot be moved until they are unfixed.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">Backbone</td>
    <td valign="top">vertical bar <b>|</b> before the element</td>
    <td valign="top">Backbone atoms are considered to be part of the
mainchain of the molecule. </td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">HintLP</td>
    <td valign="top">colon <b>:</b> before the hybridization</td>
    <td valign="top">HintLP indicates the presence of a lone pair which is
not delocalized into a pi electron system. </td>

  </tr>
</table>


<p><b>Note: </b>When editing atom properties using the Atom Manager, automatic hydrogen adjustment is not
performed. 

<a name="SVL_Commands"></a>
<h2><a name="SVL"></a>SVL Commands</h2>

<p>Although atom, residue, and chain properties are easily accessible from
the graphical interface, SVL functions offer greater control and
flexibility for modifying the attributes of a molecular object.  Atom,
residue, and chain properties can be accessed and edited both at the SVL
command line and from within SVL programs using the following SVL
functions:

<ul>
  <li><a href="../fcnref/atom.htm">Atom Functions</a></li>
  <li><a href="../fcnref/residue.htm">Residue Functions</a></li>
  <li><a href="../fcnref/chain.htm">Chain Functions</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The hierarchical relationship between atoms, residues, and chains can
be managed using the SVL 
<a href="../fcnref/obj.htm">Molecule Object functions</a>.</p>
