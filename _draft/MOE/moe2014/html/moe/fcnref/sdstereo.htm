<p><a name="sdstereo"></a></p><h2>Description</h2>

<p>
The <tt>sdstereo</tt> program enumerates missing atom and bond stereochemistry
assignments for each molecule in a concatenated sequence of SD files or ASCII
files containing SMILES strings [Weininger&nbsp;1988].
<tt>sdstereo</tt> is an SVL program intended to be run in MOE/batch.
The intended use of <tt>sdstereo</tt> is to enumerate missing stereochemistry
assignments as a preprocessing step to other programs that do not generate
all configurations when given missing stereochemistry annotations.
The fundamental structure of operation of <tt>sdstereo</tt> is:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Read and concatenate all specified input files.
    <li>Enumerate stereochemistry assignments without duplicates.
    <li>Write multiple output molecules per input molecule.
</ol>

<p>
On most POSIX systems, the first syntax can be used: <tt>sdstereo</tt> looks
like a Unix command. If using an unusual shell, it may be necessary to  use the
second syntax. On Windows systems, use the third (batch file) or fourth syntax
lines (assuming <tt>cmd.exe</tt> is used to process commands).
</p>

<p>
<b>Options</b>.
A number of options can be specified to modify the behavior of
<tt>sdstereo</tt>.
</p>

<blockquote>
<dl>
    <p>
    <dt><tt>-help</tt></dt>
    <dd>Prints a syntax summary to <tt>stderr</tt> and then exits.</dd>
    </p>

    <p>
    <dt><tt>-verbose</tt><br /><tt>-quiet</tt></dt>
    <dd>The <tt>-verbose</tt> option enables printing of progress
    information to <tt>stderr</tt> during the run;
    <span class="nobr"><tt>-quiet</tt></span> is the default.
    </dd>
    </p>

    <p>
    <dt><tt>-sdf</tt></dt>
    <dd>Specifies that subsequent files in the <tt>sdstereo</tt> argument
    list are SD files.  The format of the SD files can be further specified
    using an option of the form
    <span class="nobr"><tt>-sdf:<i>fmt</i></tt></span> where <i>fmt</i> is
    either <tt>V2000</tt> or <tt>V3000</tt>.  If <i>fmt</i> is omitted,
    output files will be written in V2000 format (the default).  It is not
    necessary to specify the format of input SD files.
    </dd>
    </p>

    <p>
    <dt><tt>-smi</tt></dt>
    <dd>Specifies that subsequent files in the <tt>sdstereo</tt> argument
    list are whitespace separated ASCII files.
    Note that this includes <span class="nobr"><tt>-o</tt></span>
    and <span class="nobr"><tt>-f</tt></span> specifications.
    The files have one SMILES string per line, with each line beginning
    with the SMILES string;
    subsequent fields on a given line are considered to be data.
    The format of the ASCII file can be further specified using an
    option of the form <span class="nobr"><tt>-smi:</tt><i>f</i></span>
    where <i>f</i> is a single character: <tt>t</tt> for tab separated,
    <tt>c</tt> for comma separated, <tt>m</tt> for semicolon separated,
    and <tt>w</tt> for whitespace separated.
    Append a <tt>q</tt> to the option string to specify that items
    are surrounded by double quotes. Append a <tt>p</tt> to the option
    string to specify that the property names should be written as
    the first line of the output file.  For example,
    <span class="nobr"><tt>-smi:tq</tt></span>
    specifies files in which each line contains tab-separated items
    with each item enclosed in double quotes.
    </dd>
    </p>

    <p>
    <dt><tt>-o</tt> <i>outputfilename</i></dt>
    <dd>By default, output is written to <tt>stdout</tt>; however, if the
    <span class="nobr"><tt>-o</tt></span> option is present then output
    will be written to the
    given <i>outputfilename</i>.
    A filename of <tt>-</tt> is interpreted as <tt>stdout</tt>.
    Specifying a filename of <tt>.</tt> will suppress the output.
    </dd>
    </p>

    <p>
    <dt><tt>-f</tt> <i>filterfilename</i></dt>
    <dd>Specifies the name of the filter file into which <tt>sdstereo</tt>
    write molecules that cannot be enumerated because of size, or inconsistent
    input stereo annotations, or other failures.  Molecules are either
    written to the output file or the filter file but not both.
    A filename of <tt>-</tt> is interpreted as <tt>stdout</tt>.
    Specifying a filename of <tt>.</tt> will suppress the filter file
    (the default).
    </dd>
    </p>

    <p>
    <dt><tt>-instereo</tt><br /><tt>-noinstereo</tt></dt>
    <dd>The <tt>-instereo</tt> option indicates that input stereochemistry
    assignments are to be preserved in the output (the default); that is,
    only missing annotations will be generated.
    The <span class="nobr"><tt>-noinstereo</tt></span> causes all
    stereochemistry assignments
    to be removed prior to enumeration (as though there were no input
    assignments at all).
    </dd>
    </p>

    <p>
    <dt><tt>-enum</tt> <i>pattern</i><br /><tt>-noenum</tt> <i>pattern</i></dt>
    <dd>Normally, <tt>sdstereo</tt> will enumerate all tetrahedral
    and double-bond (E/Z) centers 
    with potential stereochemistry (see <a href="#Methods">Methods</a>
    section, below).
    The <span class="nobr"><tt>-enum</tt></span> and
    <span class="nobr"><tt>-noenum</tt></span> options are used to specify
    further rules that control enumeration of specific atoms determined
    by the SMARTS string <i>pattern</i>.  Multiple
    <span class="nobr"><tt>-enum</tt></span> and
    <span class="nobr"><tt>-noenum</tt></span> arguments may be specified and
    are applied sequentially from right to left.
    Use of <span class="nobr"><tt>-enum</tt></span> specifies that
    candidate center identified by
    <i>pattern</i> will be enumerated;
    <span class="nobr"><tt>-noenum</tt></span> specifies
    that the candidate will not be enumerated (and its input stereochemistry
    annotation left intact).
    For example,
    <span class="nobr"><tt>-noenum&nbsp;&quot;N!@=*&quot;</tt></span>
    will disable
    enumeration of nitrogen atoms with double bonds that are not in rings.
    </dd>
    </p>

    <p>
    <dt><tt>-enumlimit</tt> <i>number</i></dt>
    <dd>Specifies the maximum number of enumerated unique stereochemistry
    states for each output molecule.  Molecules for which the number of
    enumerated unique stereochemistry states would exceed the specified
    number are suppressed from the output file (and possibly written
    to the filter file).  The default is 256.
    </dd>
    </p>

    <p>
    <dt><tt>-jctfilter</tt><br /><tt>-nojctfilter</tt></dt>
    <dd>The <tt>-jctfilter</tt> option causes <tt>sdstereo</tt> to discard
    stereo configurations that contain trans substituents
    at the junction of small <i>sp</i><sup>3</sup> rings
    (5-5, 5-4, 5-3, 4-4, 4-3).
    The default is <span class="nobr"><tt>-nojctfilter</tt></span> (no removal).
    </dd>

    </p>

    <p>
    <dt><tt>-errfield</tt> <i>fieldname</i></dt>
    <dd>When a molecule is written to the filter file (because of a failure
    to enumerate), a diagnostic code is written to the specified
    <i>fieldname</i>.  The default is none.
    </dd>
    </p>

    <p>
    <dt><tt>-mseq</tt> <i>name</i></dt>
    <dd>The source molecule index number (in
    the input sequence) will be output for
    each output structure into a data field specified by <i>name</i>.
    All enumerated stereochemistry
    states for a given input molecule will have the same sequence number,
    identifying which output molecules belong together.
    </dd>
    </p>
</dl>

<p>
<b>Argument Processing</b>.  The input arguments to <tt>sdstereo</tt> are
processed in left-to-right order.  An argument that starts with a dash
<span class="nobr">("-")</span> is
taken as an option specification.  An argument of the form
<span class="nobr">@<i>filename</i></span> specifies that the contents of
<i>filename</i> are read and inserted
into the argument stream for further argument processing (which is useful to
avoid long command lines or to record commonly used arguments and files).
Any other argument form is taken to be an input file.<br /><br />
<b>Note:</b> the
@<i>filename</i> can only appear where an option or filename would normally
be processed and cannot be used as the second argument to an option
(e.g. <span class="nobr"><tt>-o</tt>&nbsp;@<i>filename</i></span>
specifies <span class="nobr">@<i>filename</i></span> as
the actual output file).
</p>
<p>
The input files are processed in left-to-right order.
Input files containing "*" or "?" are
interpreted as filename patterns and each will be substituted with all
filenames that match the given pattern; for example, <tt>*.sdf</tt> will
be substituted with all filenames in the current directory that have a
<tt>.sdf</tt> suffix.
The input file
<span class="nobr">"-"</span>
is interpreted as <tt>stdin</tt> (for use with pipes).  If there are no
explicit input files, <tt>stdin</tt> is used as the single input file.
</p>

<a id="Methods" name="Methods">
<b>Methods</b></a>.
The enumeration of stereochemistry annotations is driven by the fact that
in many compound collections stereochemistry annotations are either
incomplete or incorrect.  Mesomers and epimers often do not have annotations;
similarly, neither do nitrogen atoms in piperazine nor
other non-carbon tetrahedral centers.
Some conformation generation programs do not automatically generate all
stereochemical states and often choose one arbitrarily.
Thus, a primary use of <tt>sdstereo</tt> is to provide missing
stereochemistry annotations that are needed for certain 3D conformation
generators.
(Note that MOE Conformation Import and Stochastic Search
<i>will</i> enumerate unconstrained centers and so <tt>sdstereo</tt> is
not required.)
<p>

<p>
Stereochemistry enumeration without duplicates is a non-trivial undertaking
for three main reasons:

<ol>
<p>
<li>
In SD files, double bond stereochemistry is encoded with the depiction
coordinates: a program enumerating double bond stereochemistry and
producing SD files must be able to generate compound depictions.
(Double bond stereo enumeration is often done in SMILES format since depictions
are not required for the output.) 
<tt>sdstereo</tt> uses the MOE depiction algorithm [Clark&nbsp;2006]
to generate depictions when enumerating double bond stereochemistry.
</li>
</p>

<p>
<li>
Duplicate removal can be difficult: molecules with symmetry (e.g. mesomers)
can have a large number of apparently independent stereocenters; however,
many of the resulting stereo specifications are the same.  The CIP system
cannot always be used as the sole method of stereochemistry determination;
for example, two fused cyclohexanes require stereochemistry annotations but
the CIP system will mark the fuse points as symmetric.  In addition, atom
annotations (such as attachment points) must be taken into account.
<tt>sdstereo</tt> uses MOE's extended SMILES notation [Weininger&nbsp;1988]
that accounts for local stereochemistry, attachment points, atom reaction
numbering, etc. when removing duplicates.
</li>
</p>

<p>
<li>
Caged structures and other complex ring structures are difficult to process
solely in connection table format.  Often, complex ring structures contain
many potential stereocenters but only a very few configurations of these
centers correspond to realistic 3D conformations.  For example, substituted
cubanes may have many tetrahedral centers but only a maximum of two
3D embeddable conformations.
<tt>sdstereo</tt> identifies these complex structures and verifies that
all stereochemistry annotations correspond to a realistic 3D structure
by using a conformational search of the ring substructure.
</li>
</p>
</ol>

<p>
Molecules are processed one by one, each generating zero (on failures), one
(for unambiguous structures) or more (for ambiguous structures) output
molecules.  Associated data fields are replicated.  Molecules for which
the enumeration limit is exceeded, or for which no output structures are
generated are not written to the output file and are (optionally) written
to a filter file (specified with the
<span class="nobr"><tt>-f</tt></span> option) along with an
optional diagnostic (specified with the
<span class="nobr"><tt>-errfield</tt></span> option).
</p>

<p>
The first step in processing is to identify the potential stereocenters
of a molecule and clear the stereochemistry annotations for the other
atoms (which cannot possibly be stereocenters).  If the
<span class="nobr"><tt>-noinstereo</tt></span>
option is enabled then all stereochemistry annotations are cleared prior
to processing.
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>
<i>sp</i><sup>2</sup> centers involved in exactly one double bond are retained
as candidates for enumeration only if
a)&nbsp;the double bond is not in a ring of size 10 or less; and
b)&nbsp;the centers are not double bonded to a tetrahedral center (e.g. ylides); and
c)&nbsp;the centers have two or three heavy neighbors (non H/LP);
otherwise the stereochemistry assignment is cleared.
</li>
</p>

<p>
<li>
<i>sp</i><sup>3</sup> centers are retained as candidates for
enumeration only if they
a)&nbsp;have a total of three or four neighbors (including implicit
hydrogens), at least three of which must be heavy (non H/LP); and
b)&nbsp;are not in 3 or 4 rings, nor are clearly pi-conjugated (to carbocations,
boron, metals, (thio)amides, NCN resonance forms, etc.);
otherwise the stereochemistry is cleared.
</li>
</p>
</ol>

<p>
This list of candidate atoms is further reduced by eliminating (and
clearing the stereo annotations of) atoms with terminal
symmetric atoms (e.g.
&gt;CF2, =CF2, sulfone sulfurs, etc.).  Then, an analysis is conducted
to see if stereochemistry assignment can induce distinguishability
among symmetric atoms (i.e. r/s or e/z stereochemistry).  This is done
by assuming that all of the candidate stereo centers can be distinguished
and then locating other symmetric atoms.  The candidate atoms with symmetric
substituents are removed and the process repeated until no more reductions
can be made.  In this reduction, care is taken not to eliminate candidates
whose symmetric substituents are in the same ring block (e.g. fused
cyclohexane and piperazine).
</p>

<p>
The resulting candidate list is further reduced by applying the
rules specified by the
<span class="nobr"><tt>-enum</tt></span> and
<span class="nobr"><tt>-noenum</tt></span> SMARTS patterns.
Atoms and bonds identified by the rules for non-enumeration are removed
from the set of candidates, but the stereochemistry assignments are left
intact.  These rules are mostly used to decide the enumeration status
of tertiary nitrogens (e.g. in piperazine, aniline, etc.) and imine
nitrogens.  Certain conformation generators are capable of rotating
about chain imine double bonds and consequently such programs do not
require enumeration treatment for these bonds.
</p>

<p>
Next, the caged ring structures are identified by a disconnection procedure
that (temporarily) disconnects terminal and other simple fused rings.  This
leaves a collection of substructures which are subjected to conformational
analysis.  The resulting conformations are used to determine the collection
of stereochemistry assignments consistent with one of the 3D conformations.
In the enumeration to follow, only these assignments will be made; for example,
two for cubane and adamantane.
</p>

<p>
Finally, all possible combinations of stereo assignments of the
candidate atoms and bonds which are consistent with the determined 3D
conformations are generated.  For each assignment, a unique SMILES string
is generated and the unique assignments are identified.
If, during the enumeration, the number of assignments exceeds the
limit set by
<span class="nobr"><tt>-enumlimit</tt></span> or no assignments can be
made (e.g.
from inconsistent input annotations) then the original molecule is written
to the filter file (if specified).  Otherwise, each of the stereochemistry
assignments for the molecule is written to the output file.  New depictions
are generated if necessary as well as new wedge bond assignments.
</p>

<p><b>Examples</b>.
Typically, <tt>sdstereo</tt> is run <i>after</i> <tt>sdwash</tt> has been
used to generate tautomers and ionization states.  In this case, certain
stereochemistry centers (such as epimers) will have no stereochemistry
assignments.  The <tt>sdfilter</tt> program should be used to eliminate
large or inorganic or non-druglike structures.
Assuming that <tt>$MOE/bin</tt> is in the PATH environment variable,
the following can be used to process the result:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>    sdstereo myfile.sdf -enumlimit 32 -noenum &quot;[NX3]a&quot; -o myfile_enum.sdf -f myfile_filter.sdf
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
which enumerates the missing stereo assignments in the SD file
<tt>myfile.sdf</tt>, retains only structures with 32 or fewer stereo states,
prevents enumeration of tertiary nitrogen atoms adjacent to aromatics,
writes the output structures to <tt>myfile_enum.sdf</tt> and the filtered
structures to <tt>myfile_filter.sdf</tt>.  Alternatively, if the same
structures were given in a tab-separated ASCII file with SMILES as the
first item on each line, then
</p>

<blockquote><pre>    sdstereo -smi:t myfile.txt -enumlimit 32 -noenum &quot;[NX3]a&quot; -sdf -o myfile_enum.sdf -f myfile_filter.sdf
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
would perform the same task but, in addition, convert the SMILES file into
an SD output file (and SD output filter).  It is possible to use <tt>sdstereo</tt>
to identify molecules with incomplete assignments:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>    sdstereo myfile.sdf -enumlimit 1 -o . -f myfile_amb.sdf
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
which processes <tt>myfile.sdf</tt> with suppressed output and writes
those molecules with more than one stereo assignment to
<tt>myfile_amb.sdf</tt>.
As the <span class="nobr"><tt>-sdf</tt></span> option is omitted, all of
the output files will be written as MDL V2000 SD files.
