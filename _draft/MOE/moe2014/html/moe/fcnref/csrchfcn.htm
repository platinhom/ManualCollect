<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
The <tt>ConfSearch</tt> function performs detailed conformational search either
on the currently loaded molecular system or a given molecular database.
This function is not intended for high-throughput applications; consequently,
any supplied database should be only of modest size.  For each input molecular
system, the following algorithm is used to generate conformations:

<ol>
<li>Perturb the coordinates of the atoms.  Each conformational search
method will perform this in a different way.
Systematic Search will systematically rotate all non-ring bonds in fixed
increments.
Stochastic Search will randomly rotate all bonds, even in rings.
LowModeMD will perform a short molecular dynamics simulation using special
initial velocities.
Refine will <b>not</b> change the input coordinates.
<p>
<li>Energy minimize the atoms to a specified root mean square gradient.
<p>
<li>Save the resulting conformation if it is novel and of reasonable
strain energy; otherwise discard the conformation.  An RMSD criterion
is used for duplicate detection; optimal rotation and translation are
applied for systems with no fixed atoms.
<p>
<li>Return to Step 1.
</ol>

<p>
The generated conformations will depend on the method chosen.  Each method
is suitable for different situations.  All of the methods will honor
fixed atoms (and not change their coordinates) if the currently loaded
molecular system is specified.  A rough guide is given below.

<blockquote><table class="titlebar">
<tr>
<th>Method</th>
<th>Situation</th>
<tr>
<td><tt>LowModeMD</tt>
<td>
Systems of any size (small molecules, macrocycles, protein loops, water
clusters).  Ring conformations are explored.  Stereochemistry is not
explored.  Good for complex non-bonded environments.  Supports
multiple component systems.
<tr>
<td><tt>Stochastic</tt>
<td>
Good for small molecules with a single connected component.  Ring
conformations are explored.  Stereochemistry is explored.  Especially good
for small fragments.  Inefficiency can result in systems with many
fused <i>sp</i><sup>3</sup> ring junctions.  Not suitable for macrocycles.
<tr>
<td><tt>Systematic</tt>
<td>
Good for small molecules with a single connected component with few
rotatable bonds.  Ring conformations are not explored.  Stereochemistry
is not explored.
<tr>
<td><tt>Refine</tt>
<td>
Typically used to refine molecular dynamics trajectories or use a
quantum chemical (QM) method to refine classically-generated structures.
No conformational
search is performed but all resulting refinements are subjected to
duplicate removal.  Good for systems of any size or complexity,
although the performance requirements of QM methods scale dramatically
with system size.

<p>
The behavior of the <tt>ConfSearch</tt> function is specified by the
argument tagged vector.  The legal options are as follows.

<blockquote><dl>
<dt><tt>chair_only</tt> : <i>flag</i>
<dd>
If on, then conformations that contain six membered rings with all single
bonds in non-chair conformations will be discarded.  This option is ignored
by the Systematic method.  The default is 1.

<p>
<dt><tt>dbappend</tt> : <i>flag</i>
<dd>
If false then the <tt>outfile</tt> database will overwrite any existing
file of the same name.
If true then the results of the conformational search will be appended
to an existing molecular database with the name <tt>outfile</tt>.
The default is 0.
<p>
<dt><tt>dbview</tt> : <i>flag</i>
<dd>
If true then the <tt>outfile</tt> database (if non-empty) will be opened
in a Database Viewer.  The default is 0.

<p>
<dt><tt>cutoff</tt> : <i>num</i>
<dd>
A generated conformation will be discarded if its strain energy
(relative to the minimum energy of all conformations with the same
stereochemistry configuration) does not exceed the given value (in kcal/mol).
Use larger values for complex systems like protein loops and smaller
values for small molecules.
The default is 7.0.
<p>
<dt><tt>cutoff_chi</tt> : <i>flag</i>
<dd>
If true then strain energies will be measured relative to the minimum energy
of all conformations with the same stereochemistry configuration.  If
false, then stereochemistry configuration will be ignored when measuring
strain energy.  The default is 1.

<p>
<dt><tt>free_shape</tt> : <i>flag</i>
<dd>
Certain shape descriptors are written to the output database for each
conformation.  If <tt>free_shape</tt> is true then only the unfixed atoms
will be included in the shape descriptor calculation; otherwise, all atoms
will be included.  The default is 0.

<p>
<dt><tt>gtest</tt> : <i>flag</i>
<dd>
The root mean square gradient test to use to terminate energy minimizations
(in kcal/mol/A).  Small magnitude values are suitable for small molecules.
Larger values such as 0.1 or 1.0 are suitable for large systems.  
The larger the value the less likely a local minimum will have been
reached and, consequently, duplicate detection will be less effective.
The default is 0.005.

<p>
<dt><tt>infield</tt> : <i>token</i>
<dd>
The name of the input database field containing the structures to be searched.
If omitted, the first available structure field will be used.  The default
is the empty token.

<p>
<dt><tt>infile</tt> : <i>token</i>
<dd>
If the given token is empty then the currently loaded molecular system
is subjected to conformational search.
The filename of a MOE molecular database.  Each molecule in the first
molecule type field in every entry is subjected to conformational search.
The default is the empty token.
<p>
<dt><tt>infile_data</tt> : <i>flag</i>
<dd>
If true then data fields from the <tt>infile</tt> database will be copied
to the output.  <b>Note!</b> If an <tt>infile</tt> field has the same
name as an <tt>outfile</tt> field then it will not be copied.
The default is 1.
<p>
<dt><tt>infile_esel</tt> : <i>flag</i>
<dd>
If true then <tt>infile</tt> database only selected entries in a Database
Viewer will be processed; the unselected entries will be skipped.  If the
<tt>infile</tt> database is not opened in a Database Viewer then all entries
will be considered selected.
The default is 0.

<p>
<dt><tt>invert_sp3</tt> : <i>flag</i>
<dd>
If true then unconstrained <i>sp</i><sup>3</sup> stereo centers will be
randomly inverted (to explore stereochemistry configurations).
This option is ignored for the Systematic, LowModeMD and Refine methods.
The default is 0.

<p>
<dt><tt>maxconf</tt> : <i>num</i>
<dd>
No more than the given number of (lowest energy) conformations for a particular
molecule in a particular stereochemistry configuration will be retained.
This option does not affect speed and the diversity of output may be
adversely affected if it is set too low.
The default is 10000.
<p>
<dt><tt>maxfail</tt> : <i>num</i>
<dd>
For given molecule, the conformational search will terminated no new
conformation is discovered after the given number of consecutive iterations.
This limit is ignored the Systematic and Refine methods.
For very thorough search of small molecules, a value of 300-500 will
generally produce a complete search.  For small systems, this limit
is generally the one that terminates the search.  For large systems, this
value will rarely be reached; consequently, <tt>maxit</tt> should be used
to control the search.
The default is 100.
<p>
<dt><tt>maxit</tt> : <i>num</i>
<dd>
For each molecule, the conformational search will terminate after the
given number of iterations.  This option is ignored for the Refine and
Systematic methods.  For small molecules, there is little need to change
this option since other limits will generally terminate the search.
<b>Note!</b> For large systems it is important to use a smaller value
such as 1000 since there is little chance that a complete set of
conformations will be generated.
The default is 10000.

<p>
<dt><tt>method</tt> : <i>token</i>
<dd>
The conformational search method to use for each molecule.  Legal values
are <tt>'LowModeMD'</tt>, <tt>'Stochastic'</tt>, <tt>'Systematic'</tt>
and <tt>'Refine'</tt>.  For large systems, only <tt>'LowModeMD'</tt>
and <tt>'Refine'</tt> are suitable.  The <tt>'Refine'</tt> method is
used typically to refine molecular dynamics trajectories.
The default is <tt>'LowModeMD'</tt>.

<p>
<dt><tt>mm_maxit</tt> : <i>num</i>
<dd>
Energy minimization will be terminated if a local minimum is not reached
after the specified number of iterations.  A value of 0 disables energy
minimization; a zero setting is not compatible with the Stochastic method.
The default is 500.

<p>
<dt><tt>outfile</tt> : <i>token</i>
<dd>
The name of the output database to which conformations will be written.
If the given token is empty then conformations will not be written to
any database; however, the conformational search will proceed and upon
termination the lowest energy structure encountered will be retained
in the current system.
The default is <tt>'csearch.mdb'</tt>.

<p>
<dt><tt>QM</tt> : <i>tagged vector</i>
<dd>
The behavior of the quantum chemical (QM) engine used by QM refinement can
be modified via the QM tagged vector.  This specifies the SCF engine to use
along with various
options for its execution.  It is described <a href="#QMtagvec">below</a>.
If unspecified, the user's default settings will be used if available.
The default is the null vector.

<p>
<dt><tt>pot_charge</tt> : <i>flag</i>
<dd>
If true then the partial charges of the atoms will be calculated according
the specifications of the currently loaded forcefield.  Otherwise, the
partial charges will be left as-is and assumed to be valid.
The default is 1.

<p>
<dt><tt>rmsd</tt> : <i>num</i>
<dd>
Two conformations are considered duplicates if the root mean square distance
between them is greater than the specified tolerance (in angstroms).
Only heavy atoms are considered, unless the <tt>rmsd_H</tt> flag is true.
Topological symmetry is taken into account.  Fixed atoms in the
molecular system are not included in the calculation.
The default is 0.25.
<p>
<dt><tt>rmsd_H</tt> : <i>flag</i>
<dd>
If true the hydrogen and lone pair atoms will be included in the RMSD
calculation (for duplicate detection).  The default is 0.

<p>
<dt><tt>rot_amide</tt> : <i>flag</i>
<dd>
If true then amide bonds will be rotated to explore <i>cis</i> and <i>trans</i>
amides.  This option is ignored for the LowModeMD and Refine methods.
The default is 0.
<p>
<dt><tt>rot_double</tt> : <i>flag</i>
<dd>
If true then double bonds without stereochemistry constraints will be
rotated (to explore stereochemistry configurations).
This option is ignored for the LowModeMD and Refine methods.
The default is 0.

<p>
<dt><tt>useQM</tt> : <i>flag</i>
<dd>
If true the structures in the output database will be refined using a
quantum chemical (QM) method.  The unique results will be written to a
second output database whose name is constructed by appending <tt>_qm</tt>
to the output database name.  Thus, if the output database is
<tt>csearch.mdb</tt>, QM refinement will create <tt>csearch_qm.mdb</tt>.
The default is 0.

<p>
<dt><tt>verbose</tt> : <i>flag</i>
<dd>
If true the information will be written to the SVL Commands window during
the calculation; otherwise, nothing will be written.  The default is 0.

<p>
<a name="QMtagvec"</a>
The behavior of the quantum chemical (QM) engine used by QM refinement
is specified by the QM tagged vector.

<a href="../../apps/emin.htm"><b>Energy Minimize</b></a> or
<a href="../../apps/confsrch.htm"><b>Conformational Search</b></a>
applications.  The legal options are as follows.

The default is the default basis set (or Hamiltonian for MOPAC) for the QM
engine.

<p>
<dt><tt>do_cyclic</tt> : <i>flag</i>
<dd>
If true, a multi-step calculation is performed to increase the likelihood
of successful geometry optiomization.  This is described in
<a href="../../apps/scf.htm#MultiStep">SCF Wavefunctions</a>, and is
currently limited to the Gaussian SCF engine.  The default is 0 (1 for
Gaussian).

<p>
<dt><tt>do_opt</tt> : <i>flag</i>
<dd>
If true, a geometry optimization is performed using the specified SCF

token.

<p>
<dt><tt>keepfiles</tt> : <i>flag</i>
<dd>
If true, the input and output files from the SCF engine will be retained.
These will be saved in the execution directory whose name is drawn from
the output database with <tt>_conffiles</tt> appended.  For example,
if the output database is <tt>csearch.mdb</tt>, the QM refined structures
will be written to <tt>csearch_qm.mdb</tt> and the SCF engine input and output
files will be found in <tt>csearch_qm_conffiles</tt>.  The default is 0.

<p>
<dt><tt>keywords</tt> : <i>token</i>
<dd>
The extra keywords that will be provided to the SCF engine.  Consult the
third party documentation manual for a description of the supported keywords
and how they affect the calculation.  The default is the null token.

<p>
<dt><tt>linscale</tt> : <i>flag</i>
<dd>
If true and supported by the SCF engine, linear scaling methods will be used.
This makes calculations on large-scale systems possible in reasonable amounts
of time and can result in some loss of precision.  The default is 0.

<p>
<dt><tt>method</tt> : <i>token</i>
<dd>
The computational method that will be used for the calculation.  These include
Semi-Empirical, Hartree-Fock, Density Functional Theory and/or

varying cost and complexity.  The default is unique to each SCF engine.

<p>
<dt><tt>multip</tt> : <i>num</i>
<dd>

being processed.

<p>
<dt><tt>reconnect</tt> : <i>token</i>
<dd>
If on, the topology of the system will be recalculated when the minimization
completes: bonds, hybridization, ionization and hint LP values are
determined from the resulting geometry.  The default is 0.

<p>
<dt><tt>solveps</tt> : <i>num</i>
<dd>
If specified, this is the dielectric constant (&epsilon;) to use in the
specified solvent model in the SCF engine.  The default is the default
value for the SCF engine/solvent model selected.

<p>
<dt><tt>solvmodel</tt> : <i>token</i>
<dd>
If specified, this is the name of the solvent model to use with the QM
refinement calculations.  It must be the name of one of the valid solvent
model for the SCF engine.  The default is the null token (i.e., no solvent
model is used).

<p>
<dt><tt>solvrad</tt> : <i>num</i>
<dd>
If specified and supported by the SCF engine, this is the solute radius
to use in the specified solvent model in the SCF engine.  The default is
the default value for the SCF engine/solvent model selected.
