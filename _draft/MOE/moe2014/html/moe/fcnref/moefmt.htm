<p><a name="file"></a></p><h2>Description</h2>

<p>
A MOE file is an ASCII file (characters 0 through 127 only) interpreted
according to strict syntax rules which are described in this document.
The MOE file format was designed with flexibility and future enhancements in
mind.  For this reason, MOE files have some self-describing features (although
no attempt was made to create a fully self-describing format such as XML).

<p>
<b>Lines</b>.
MOE files are interpreted as a sequence of <i>lines</i> of any length.
A line is terminated with any of the following character strings:
a) CR not followed by LF; b) LF; c) the two-character combination CR LF;
and d) end-of-file.  Here CR denotes the carriage return ASCII character
(octal 015) and LF denotes the line feed ASCII character (octal 012).  Thus,
files written under MacOS, Windows or Unix can be read and properly split
into lines (even if the line formats are mixed within the file).

<p>
<b>Words</b>.
Each line of a MOE file is divided into <i>words</i>.  A word is a non-zero
length sequence of non-whitespace characters surrounded by either a) the
beginning of line; b) the end of line; or c) whitespace.  A <i>whitespace</i>
character is any one of blank (octal 040), backspace (octal 010),
tab (octal 011), form-feed (octal 014) as well as CR and LF.

<p>
Some words in a MOE file are expected to have a particular format and
content because they will be interpreted in a specific way (such as
integers or real numbers).  The following table denotes the names and
formats of particular types of words:

<p>
<table class="titlebar" width="100%" border="1" cellpadding="3">

<th>Type</th>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Description</th>
<tr>
<td valign="baseline"><tt>i</tt>
<td valign="baseline">integer
<td valign="baseline">A decimal integer with characters in the set
<tt>[-+0123456789]</tt>.

<td valign="baseline">string
<td valign="baseline">An array of characters (bytes in the range 0..255) encoded

<tr>
<td valign="baseline"><tt>tt</tt>
<td valign="baseline">token
<td valign="baseline">An array of characters (bytes in the range 0..255) encoded
by the scheme described below (to be read as a <tt>tok</tt> SVL data type).
</table>

<p>
The word types that encode characters (<tt>c, ss, tt</tt>) must follow a
particular encoding so that whitespace and other non-printable ASCII
characters do not appear in the file data stream.  Characters appear in the
file as either a single character or a two-character combination that must
be mapped to a single ASCII character.  We define the following sets of
characters (note that the RAW set includes blank (octal 040)):

<p><blockquote>
ENCODE = <tt>[A-Za-z0-9+/]</tt> &nbsp;
PREFIX = <tt>[$%&~]</tt> &nbsp;
RAW = <tt>[A-Za-z0-9 ()+-*.,/:;=?[_]{|}^]</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>
The following algorithm is used to encode a string of bytes (values in the
range [0,255]):

<ol>
<li>
An empty string is encoded as the single character "$" (octal 044).
<p><li>
Every character <i>k</i> not in the RAW set is replaced by the two character
combination PREFIX(<i>i</i>) ENCODE(<i>j</i>) where
<span class="nobr"><i>i</i> = 1 + (k >> 6)</span> and <nobr><i>j</i> = 1 + (k & 0x3F)</nobr>.
<p><li>
Replace any blanks (octal 040) with "!" (octal 041).
</ol>

<p>
The following algorithm is used to decode strings that have been encoded
by the previous scheme:

<ol>
<li>
Remove all characters not in the union of the RAW, ENCODE, PREFIX and {"!"}
sets of characters.

<p><li>

Replace all two character combinations AB in which A is in the PREFIX set
with either a) the corresponding ASCII character if B is in the ENCODE set,
or b) the character "A" if B is not in the ENCODE set.

<p><li>
If the resulting string is exactly "$" (octal 044) then return the empty
string.
<p><li>
Replace any "!" (octal 041) characters with blank (octal 040) and return
the resulting string.
</ol>


<p>
<b>Paragraphs</b>. A <i>paragraph</i> is a contiguous sequence of lines
such that a) the first character of the first word of the first line is "#"
(octal 043); and b) "#" does not appear as the first character of the first
word of any subsequent line of the paragraph.  A paragraph contains specific
data for the file.  Paragraphs without meaning to a particular reader
can safely be ignored by scanning for the next paragraph marker (the "#").
<p>
The following SVL code can be used to process a MOE file by repeatedly
searching for the start of the next paragraph and processing it:
<blockquote><pre>
// wordsplit splits a line into words

<b>local function</b> wordsplit line
    <b>local</b> k = x_pack not isspace line;      // split into words
    <b>local</b> c = mtoc (rotr k &lt;> dec k);       // word lengths
    <b>return</b> split [line[k], c];              // word strings
<b>endfunction</b>

// nextparagraph reads lines from the input file, f, until
// a new paragraph is detected.  We then return the words of
// the first line of the paragraph.  [] is returned if the
// end of file is encountered.

<b>local function</b> nextparagraph f
    <b>local</b> line;

    <b>loop</b>
        line = freadb [f, 'line', 1];           // read a line
        <b>if</b> not length line <b>then break</b>; <b>endif</b>    // eof?
        line = wordsplit line;
    <b>until</b> line(1)(1) === "#" <b>endloop</b>            // paragraph?

    <b>return</b> line;
<b>endfunction</b>

// scanfile repeatedly searches for paragraphs and processes them

<b>local function</b> scanfile f
    <b>local</b> line;

    <b>while</b> length (line = nextparagraph f) <b>loop</b>
        // ... process the paragraph including 'line' ...
        // ... or skip it if it is not understood ...
    <b>endloop</b>
<b>endfunction</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
<b>ParaTables</b>.
A <i>ParaTable</i> is a paragraph that encodes a table (two dimensional
array) of values.  The format of the first line of the paragraph is

<blockquote>
#<i>name</i> <i>n</i> <i>field</i>1 <i>fmt</i>1 ...
<i>field</i>K <i>fmt</i>K<br />
</blockquote>

<p>The first line is followed by multiple lines consisting of data words
required by the first line.

<p>
<ul>

<li><i>name</i> is the name of the paragraph (e.g., "#bond" or "#molecule")

<li><i>n</i> is the number of entries in the table, and is encoded as a
word with word format "i"

<li><i>field</i>J is the name of the J'th column of the table, and is
encoded with word format "t"

<li><i>fmt</i>J is the value format for items in the J'th column which
appear in the data words to follow.  Legal values for the format are any
of the legal word formats (described above) and any formats in the
following table:

</ul>

<p>
<table class="titlebar" width="100%" border="1" cellpadding="3">
<tr>
<th>Format</th>
<th>Description</th>
<tr>
<td valign="baseline"><tt>i*</tt>

<td valign="baseline">A decimal integer vector.  A vector of length <i>k</i> is
encoded as a sequence of <span class="nobr"><i>k</i> + 1</span> data words, the first
being an encoding of <i>k</i> in the word "i" format followed by <i>k</i>
"i" format data words encoding the values.

<tr>
<td valign="baseline"><tt>ix*</tt>

<td valign="baseline">A hexadecimal integer vector.  A vector of length <i>k</i>
is encoded as a sequence of <span class="nobr"><i>k</i> + 1</span> data words, the first
being an encoding of <i>k</i> in the word "i" format followed by <i>k</i>
"ix" format data words encoding the values.

<tr>
<td valign="baseline"><tt>r*</tt>

<td valign="baseline">A decimal real vector.  A vector of length <i>k</i> is
encoded as a sequence of <span class="nobr"><i>k</i> + 1</span> data words, the first
being an encoding of <i>k</i> in the word "i" format followed by <i>k</i>
"r" format data words encoding the values.

<tr>
<td valign="baseline"><tt>t</tt>

<td valign="baseline">A (possibly long) token.
If the first word is tilde (<tt>~</tt>) then the next word is taken to be
a word count, <i>k</i> (in <tt>i</tt> format).  The next <i>k</i> words
are concatenated and interpreted as being in <tt>tt</tt> format.
If the first word is not tilde then <tt>tt</tt> format is assumed.

<tr>
<td valign="baseline"><tt>t*</tt>

<td valign="baseline">A token vector.  A vector of length <i>k</i> is encoded
as a sequence of <span class="nobr"><i>k</i> + 1</span> data words, the first being
an encoding of <i>k</i> in the word "i" format followed by <i>k</i> "t"
format data words encoding the values.

<tr>
<td valign="baseline"><tt>s</tt>

<td valign="baseline">A (possibly long) vector of characters.
If the first word is tilde (<tt>~</tt>) then the next word is taken to be
a word count, <i>k</i> (in <tt>i</tt> format).  The next <i>k</i> words
are concatenated and interpreted as being in <tt>ss</tt> format.
If the first word is not tilde then <tt>ss</tt> format is assumed.

<tr>
<td valign="baseline"><tt>s*</tt>

<td valign="baseline">A string vector.  A vector of length <i>k</i> is encoded
as a sequence of <span class="nobr"><i>k</i> + 1</span> data words, the first being
an encoding of <i>k</i> in the word "i" format followed by <i>k</i> "s"
format data words encoding the values.

<tr>
<td valign="baseline"><tt>*</tt>

<td valign="baseline">Variable item format.  In the data stream, the value format is
determined from a word in "t" format prepended to the data words giving the
value of the item.  This prepended word must be one of the legal formats
in this table but not the "*" format.

<tr>
<td valign="baseline"><i>f</><tt>=</tt><i>v</i>

<td valign="baseline">An implied data format.  In this case <i>f</i> is one
of the word formats (not in this table but described above) and <i>v</i> is
the word value.  For formats matching this scheme (that is, they have an
"=" character in them) no data words appear in the following word stream
but instead the <i>v</i> value is replicated for each row in the column
(i.e., an entire table column is filled with this value).

</table>

<p>The data words for a ParaTable follow a row-major ordering (the
table is encoded row by row, each row being encoded column by column).
The data words are processed by reading a line at a time until the
table has been filled.  Any remaining words in the last line are ignored.
This means that line breaks and empty lines can appear anywhere in the data
words without affecting the resulting table.  Here are several examples
of ParaTables and the associated SVL vectors they encode:

<blockquote>
<pre>
<b>#table1 3 f1 i f2 t f3 r
-5 abc 3.2 63 def
-4.1 44 ghi 0.1</b>

fields: ['f1','f2','f3']
values: [ [-5,63,44], ['abc','def','ghi'], [3.2,-4.1,-.1] ]

<b>#table2 4 f1 s f2 i=5 f3 i
abc 1 def 2 ghi 3 jkl 4</b>

fields: ['f1','f2','f3']
values: [ ["abc","def","ghi","jkl"], [5,5,5,5], [1,2,3,4] ]

<b>#table3 2 name t value i*
abc 3 1 2 3
def 2 4 5</b>

fields: ['name','value']
values: [ ['abc','def'], [ [1,2,3], [4,5] ] ]

<b>#table4 3 tag t value *
abc i 1 def s hello ghi r* 2 -1.2 0.3</b>

fields: ['tag','value']
values: [ ['abc','def','ghi'], [1, "hello", [-1.2,0.3]] ]
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>ParaTags</b>.

A <i>ParaTag</i> is a paragraph that encodes a tagged vector of values in
which the tags are tokens and the values are of variable type.  A ParaTag
is a ParaTable with the following format:

<blockquote>
#<i>name</i> <i>n</i> tag t value *<br />
... data words ...
</blockquote>

<p>
Thus, ParaTags are just a specific form of ParaTable.

<!-- GRAPHICS OBJECTS -->

<p>
<b>Graphics Objects Encoding</b>.
Graphics objects are encoded as a sequence of paragraphs according to the
syntax:

<blockquote>
<pre>
<b>#graphics</b> { <b>#gvertex</b> | <b>#gtext</b> }* <b>#endgraphics</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>That is, between the #graphics and #endgraphics indicators, any number
of #gvertex or #gtext paragraphs can appear.  Other paragraphs are ignored.
The following are the paragraph formats:

<pre>
<b>#graphics <i>n</i> tag t value *</b>
GTitle t <i>graphics-object-title</i>
GShow  i <i>graphics-object-show-flag</i>
</pre>

<p>
The "GTitle" and "GShow" tags are optional.  If GTitle is missing then the
empty token is used as a title.  If GShow is missing then a value of 1 is
assumed.   Other tags that appear are ignored.

<pre>
<b>#gtext <i>n</i> color i x r y r z r text t</b>
... data words ...
</pre>

<p>
Creates <i>n</i> text graphics.  Each graphic has a color, a position
(x,y,z) and a text token.  The color can be encoded in any numeric format
(although "i" is shown) as can x, y and z.  The text is encoded as a token.
<i>All fields are required</i> but can appear in any order.  Fields with names
other than "color", "x", "y", "z" and "text" are ignored.
Unit extending formats such as "color ix="#cccccc"" or "z r=0" are legal.

<p>
<pre>
<b>#gvertex <i>n</i> color i x r y r z r</b>
... data words ...
$ 2 tag t value *
seg i* ... data words ...
idx i* ... data words ...
</pre>

<p>This #gvertex encodes data points with color and position but no normal
vector data.  The #gvertex paragraph is special in that there are really
two data blocks.  The first is the vertex data for <i>n</i> data points.
Each <i>must</i> have a "color", "x", "y" and "z" (in any order and in
any numeric format).  The next block encodes a ParaTag with two tags:
"idx" and "seg" each of which must be a numeric vector containing the
segmentation and indices for the call to GVertex.  Unit extending formats
such as "color ix="#cccccc"" or "z r=0" are legal.  The <tt>$</tt> at the
beginning of the ParaTag is a placeholder that is ignored.

<p>
<pre>
<b>#gvertex <i>n</i> color i x r y r z r nx r ny r nz r</b>
... data words ...
$ 2 tag t value *
seg i* ... data words ...
idx i* ... data words ...
</pre>

<p>This #gvertex encodes data points with color and position and normal
vector data.  The #gvertex paragraph is special in that there are really
two data blocks. The first is the vertex data for <i>n</i> data points.
Each <i>must</i> have a "color", "x", "y", "z", "nx", "ny" and "nz"
(in any order and in any numeric format).  The next block encodes a
ParaTag with two tags: "idx" and "seg" each of which must be a numeric
vector containing the segmentation and indices for the call to GVertex.
Unit extending formats such as "color ix="#cccccc"" or "z r=0" are legal.
The <tt>$</tt> at the beginning of the ParaTag is a placeholder that
is ignored.

<pre>
<b>#endgraphics</b>
</pre>

<p>
The #endgraphics marks the end of a graphics object.  No data words are
required.

<!-- MOLECULAR OBJECTS -->

<p>
<b>Molecular Objects Encoding</b>.
The encoding of molecular objects handles all chain, residue and atom data
for a molecular system.  There is no notion of "molecule" as an individual
entity other than a collection of chains, residues and atoms that can be
represented in MOE as a molecular system.  Molecular objects are encoded as
a sequence of paragraphs according to the syntax:

<blockquote>
<pre>
<b>#molecule</b> { <b>#attr</b> | <b>#bond</b> }* <b>#endmolecule</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>That is, between the #molecule and #endmolecule indicators, any number
of #attr or #bond paragraphs can appear.  Other paragraphs are ignored.
The following are the paragraph formats:

<a name="Molecule"></a>
<pre>
<b>#molecule <i>n</i> tag t value *</b>
atoms i <i>number-of-atoms</i>
residues i <i>number-of-residues</i>
chains i <i>number-of-chains</i>
</pre>

<p>The #molecule paragraph defines the number of molecular objects in the
system.  Each of the "atoms", "residues" and "chains" tags must be present
(exactly once).  If there are any atoms at
all then there must be at least one residue and one chain.  These counts
define an identification system for molecular objects.  If there <i>a</i>
atoms, <i>r</i> residues and <i>c</i> chains, then individual atoms are
referenced with integer ID numbers in the range [1,<i>a</i>], residues
with integers in the range [<i>a</i>+1,<i>a</i>+<i>r</i>], and chains with
integers in the range [<i>a</i>+<i>r</i>+1,<i>a</i>+<i>r</i>+<i>c</i>].
These identification integers will appear in certain fields in the #attr and
#bond paragraphs (and any other paragraphs that refer to molecular objects).
All atoms belonging to a particular residue must be in a contiguous
block, and the order of the blocks must follow the order of the residues.
All residues belonging to a particular chain must be in a contiguous block,
and the order of the blocks must follow the order of the chains.


<pre>
<b>#bond <i>n</i> a i b i o i</b>
... data words ...
</pre>

<p>
The #bond paragraph defines <i>n</i> bonds between pairs of atoms.  The
data words are integer ID numbers of atoms (see the
<a href="#Molecule">#molecule</a> paragraph).
A bond is defined between atoms <tt>a(k)</tt> and <tt>b(k)</tt> of
order <tt>o(k)</tt>.
Legal bond orders are in the set {1,2,3}.
If the bond order term is absent then no bond order is specified (for
backward compatibility).
The bond order data words are for descriptive purposes only and
are currently ignored when reading MOE files.
Duplicate bonds are removed and symmetric bond entries are not required.

<pre>
<b>#attr <i>n</i> f1 fmt1 ... fK fmtK</b>
... data words ...
</pre>

<p>The #attr paragraph associates values with atom, residue and chain
attributes.  In general, there will be many #attr paragraphs for reasons
of encoding efficiency.  One of the field names <i>must</i> be "ID",
for specifying the molecular object identification number (see the 
<a href="#Molecule">#molecule</a> description).  The remaining fields in
the paragraph are the actual molecular object attributes and depend on
the molecular object in question.  In principle, any attribute name can be
associated with any object; however, any attributes not understood by MOE
for a particular object will be ignored.

<p>The following attributes are associated with chain objects:

<p>
The <tt>#endmolecule</tt> marks the end of the molecular objects.
No data words are required.

<!-- MOE FILE FORMAT -->

<p>
<b>MOE Molecule File Format</b>.
The MOE Molecule File is an ASCII file following the previously described
conventions in this document.  It can contain a single #molecule block
and any number of #graphics blocks along with other molecular system
properties of MOE.  The legal paragraph syntax is

<blockquote>
<pre>
<b>#moe #system</b> <b>#molecule</b> { <i>item</i> }* <b>#endsystem</b>
<i>item</i> := <b>#graphics</b> | <b>#meter</b> | <b>#restraint</b> | <b>#alignmentconstraint</b> |<b> #collection</b>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The <tt>#molecule</tt> and <tt>#graphics</tt> blocks have been described
previously in this document.  The following are the details of the paragraphs
in a MOE Molecule File.

<pre><b>#moe yyyy.mm</b>
</pre>

<p>
The first line of the MOE file must be the #moe paragraph.  The single
word is the revision of the file format where yyyy is the year and mm is
the month of the revision.

<pre><b>#system <i>n</i> tag t value *</b>
BoxEnable i* 3 <i>3-vector-of-flags</i>
BoxSize r* 3 <i>3-vector-of-sizes</i>
ViewOrientationY r* 3 <i>unit-3-vector</i>
ViewOrientationZ r* 3 <i>unit-3-vector</i>
ViewScale r <i>window-diagonal</i>
ViewLookat r* 3 <i>3-vector-view-center</i>
ViewDepthCueFront r <i>value</i>
ViewDepthCueStrength r <i>value</i>
</pre>

<p>
The #system paragraph begins the molecular system data in the MOE file.
Each of the tags is optional and suitable defaults are chosen in their
absence.  The BoxEnable and BoxSize tags refer to the periodic box enabling
flags and dimensions.  The View tags refer to the rendering orientation.

<p>The #molecule paragraph follows the #system paragraph.

<pre><b>#meter <i>n</i> type t atoms i*</b>
... data words ...
</pre>

<p>
The #meter paragraph defines <i>n</i> measurement meters.  Both fields
"type" and "atoms" are required.  The "type" values must be one of
'distance', 'angle' or 'dihedral'.  The "atoms" values are sets of valid
atom ID numbers (see <tt>#molecule</tt> description).


<pre><b>#restraint <i>n</i> type t atoms i* target r weight r</b>
... data words ...
</pre>

<p>
The #restraint paragraph defines <i>n</i> geometry restraints.  All fields
"type", "atoms", "target" and "weight" are required.  The "type" values must
be one of 'distance', 'angle' or 'dihedral'.  The "atoms" values are sets of
valid atom ID numbers (see <tt>#molecule</tt> description).

<pre><b>#alignmentconstraint <i>n</i> residues i* show i</b>
... data words ...
</pre>

<p>
The #alignmentconstraint paragraph defines <i>n</i> alignment constraints.
Both the "residues" and "show" fields are required.  Each "show" value is
a flag indicating whether or not the constraint is to be displayed in the
Sequence Editor.  The "residues" values are sets of valid residue ID
numbers (see <tt>#molecule</tt> description).

<pre><b>#collection <i>n</i> name t objects i*</b>
... data words ...
</pre>

<p>
The #collection paragraph defines <i>n</i> collections.  Both "name" and
"objects" fields are required.  
<tt>name</tt> is a string defining the name of the collection.
<tt>objects</tt> values are
valid atom, residue and chain ID numbers 
(see <tt>#molecule</tt> description).


<pre><b>#endsystem</b>
</pre>

<p>This paragraph ends the molecular system data.  All subsequent
paragraphs in the file are ignored.

<p>The following is an example of the CC=O molecule with a few rendering
attributes set, and a distance meter:
