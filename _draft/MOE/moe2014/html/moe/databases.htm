<p>A number of useful databases are distributed with MOE.  Some are designed for
use with specific MOE applications while others are for more general use.</p>

<h2>Small Molecule Databases</h2>

<p><b>Leadlike Conformer Database.</b> The MOE Conformation Database
contains 3D
conformations in MOE Molecular Database (.mdb) format for approximately 650,000
(Oprea) lead-like chemical structures.  These are ready to be used for
pharmacophore searching, fingerprint analysis, and so on.
The structures were obtained from
chemical suppliers' public catalogs, including the following:

<p>
The conformations were generated with the MMFF94x forcefield using Conformation
Import in MOE.  A limit of 4.5 kcal/mol strain energy was imposed with
a 500 conformation limit for each molecule.  Duplicate conformations were
removed with a heavy atom RMSD tolerance of 0.6 angstroms (0.75 angstroms
for conformations with strain greater than 3.5 kcal/mol).
These databases (<tt>leadlike_conf_###.mdb</tt>) can be obtained 
from the MOE download page, or by contacting
<a href="mailto:support@chemcomp.com">CCG Support</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Linker Database.</b> The MOE Linker Database contains conformations for
approximately 750,000 fragments suitable for
<a href="../tutorials/scaff_tut.htm">
scaffold replacement</a> methodologies. The fragments
were generated using MOE's SD Pipeline Command Tools from 4.3 million
unique structures culled from medicinal chemistry literature and various vendor
catalogs. On average there are 24 conformations per molecule.  The database
(<tt>linker_2010_10.mdb</tt>) can be obtained
from the MOE download page, or by contacting
<a href="mailto:support@chemcomp.com">CCG Support</a>.
</p>
<p>
<b>ChEMBL r14 Database.</b> The ChEMBL r14 Database contains conformations
for approximately 830,000 fragments suitable for
<a href="../tutorials/scaff_tut.htm">scaffold replacement</a> or
combinatorial chemistry methodologies (labeled linkers). The fragments
were generated using MOE's SD Pipeline Command Tools from 1.2 million
structures in Release 14 of the
<a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembldb/">ChEMBL</a> database of bioactive
drug-like small molecules.
The database (<tt>chemblr14_frag.mdb</tt>) can be obtained 
from the MOE download page, or by contacting
<a href="mailto:support@chemcomp.com">CCG Support</a>.
Subset libraries are available in <tt>$MOE/lib</tt>.
</p>
<p>
<b>RECAP Fragments.</b> <tt>$MOE/lib/recaplib.mdb</tt> is the output of
RECAP analysis on a collection of ~750,000 diverse lead- and drug-like chemical
structures from vendor catalogs and medicinal chemistry journals.  It can be
used with the <a href="../apps/recap.htm">RECAP Panel</a>.
</p>

<h2>Protein Databases</h2>


<p><b>Non-redundant PDB.</b> <tt>$MOE/lib/pdb.mdb</tt> is a database of
non-redundant chains derived from the PDB.  Chains were clustered such that all
pairs of chains within a cluster had 90% pairwise sequence identity as well
as similar structure.  One representative was chosen from each cluster
based on resolution, R free, and number of missing residues not at the
ends of chains.  Note that ligands and solvent are <b>not</b> included in
this database, only the protein chains are stored.  This database may be
searched with the
the <a href="gui/fileopen.htm#MOEPDB">MOE-PDB page</a>
of the <a href="gui/fileopen.htm">Open panel</a>.
</p>

<p><b>Protein Families.</b> The non-redundant set of PDB chains is
further clustered structurally to form families.  These structure-based
sequence alignments are stored in the <tt>$MOE/lib/pdb.fam</tt> file in plain
text.  Small families are enhanced with additional sequences from UniRef 50.
This file can be used during <a href="../proteins/prosearch.htm"> Homology
Searching</a> to identify possible templates to a query.
</p>

<p><b>Antibody Modeling Databases</b>. The central building block for
knowledge-based <a href="../proteins/antibody.htm">antibody homology modeling</a> is the
antibody structure database, which
constitutes the information pool of the antibody homology modeling
procedures. The current antibody structure collection (MOE&nbsp;2014.09)
is composed of
over 3000 V<sub>L</sub> and 3000 V<sub>H</sub> chains stored in
<tt>$MOE/lib/fab.mdb</tt>.</p>
<p>
For more information, see the
<a href="../proteins/pdb_mdb.htm#fabDB">MOE Antibody Database</a> section.
</p>

<p><b>Kinase Modeling Databases</b>.
The MOE kinase database is part of the MOE Project databases described in
the previous section, and is found at <tt>$MOE/lib/project/Protein Kinase.mdb</tt>.
After their identification, kinase chains are further classified based on their
sequence identity within the kinase core.  If this is at least 45% within one
of the classes in the reference file <tt>$MOE/lib/kin_ref.fam</tt>, that class
is assigned; otherwise a check is conducted to verify if the sequence is
sufficiently close to one of the known pseudo kinases in the pseudo reference
file (<tt>$MOE/lib/kin_refpseudo.fam</tt>).  If the sequence identity is
higher than 35%, the sequence group is labeled as <i>Pseudo-Kinase</i>.
Sequences that are positive with respect to kinase pattern detection (G-Loop,
DFG and HRD) but lack sufficient homology with the reference sequences are
not given any classification for a kinase group, family, or subfamily.
This might apply for distant species like
bacteria, parasites, nematodes etc., since the reference collection
is biased towards the detection of human kinases.  In addition to
classifications based on sequence, the conformational states of distinct
topologies such as the DFG segment or alpha-C helix are also stored in the
database.
</p>
<p>
For more information, see the
<a href="../proteins/pdb_mdb.htm#kinDB">MOE Kinase Database</a> section.
</p>

<p><b>GPCR Structure Database</b>.
The G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) comprise the largest family
of integral membrane proteins and one of the most important classes
of drug targets.  In an effort to assist in 3D structure modeling and
function annotation, the GPCR Class A structure repository is provided
with the other MOE Project databases in
<tt>$MOE/lib/project/GPCR CLASS A.mdb</tt>.
</p>
<p>
For more information, see the
<a href="../proteins/pdb_mdb.htm#gpcrDB">MOE GPCR Database</a> section.
</p>

<p><b>MOE Project Databases</b>.
A number of protein family databases &mdash; including kinases and GPCRs &mdash; are
provided in the <tt>$MOE/lib/project</tt> directory.  These databases have been created
using the <a href="../proteins/moeproject.htm">MOE Project</a> framework, and are all very
similar in construction and appearance.  Each is superposed into a common
frame of reference based on the core region of the reference <tt>.moe</tt> files, which are also
found in <tt>$MOE/lib/project</tt>.  The databases can all be used with the
<a href="../proteins/projsrch.htm">Project Search</a> panel as the repository for
all relevant information used in this application.
</p>
<p>
For more information, see the
<a href="../proteins/pdb_mdb.htm#projDB">MOE Project Database</a> section.
</p>


<p><b>Rotamer Library.</b>
The <a href="../proteins/buildrotlib.htm">Rotamer Library</a>
in MOE is a collection of all-atom sidechain conformations created
using LowModeMD. These conformations differ from traditional
rotamer libraries in that bond length and angle variations are permitted. The
intent is to provide adequate coverage of the conformational space available to
a sidechain and not just encode dihedral preferences. The rotamers are located
in <tt>$MOE/lib/amber10.mdb</tt> in a packed conformation field associated with
each sidechain.
</p>

<p><b>Protein-Ligand Complex Database.</b> <tt>$MOE/sample/mol/complex.mdb</tt>
contains a set of structures from the PDB with experimental binding affinities.
For each entry, <b>ligand</b> stores the ligand for which binding was measured,
and <b>receptor</b>, the nearby chains.  <b>image</b> contains symmetry-related
molecules which are near the ligand, if any, and <b>water</b> contains any
water chains.  <b>dG</b> contains the experimental binding affinity of the
ligand in kcal/mol, obtained from various sources in the literature.
<b>degeneracy</b> indicates the number of copies of the ligand found in the PDB
file; each copy will have its own row in the database.  The other fields
contain summary information about the structure from the PDB file.  This
database can be used for validation studies.  </p>
