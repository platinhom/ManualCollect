<p>
The Residue pK<sub>a</sub> application is used to assign correct protonation
states to a protein or set of proteins so that they can
then be correctly protonated. This
is accomplished by identifying titratable groups within the structure
and then predicting their pK<sub>a</sub> values, using a method based on PROPKA
[Li&nbsp;2005].</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> This application was formerly named Protonation State.
</p>

<p>
In addition to setting the protonation state, predicted pK<sub>a</sub> values
can also be labeled, as shown in the following figure:
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="residuepka/x_pka.png" />

<p class="caption">A protein with predicted pK<sub>a</sub> values labeled on titratable groups,

<p>
The remainder of this document explains the methodology used to determine the
 protonation state, how to use the application, and some example calculations.</p>

<!-- ============================== PKA ============================== -->


<a name="Method"></a>
<h2>Methodology</h2>

<p> Ionizable groups in proteins often play key roles in the catalytic activity
of an enzyme, protein solubility, or protein folding.  The pH dependence of
protonation state can thus play a critical role in elucidating enzyme function or
understanding the folding pathway.  This in turn is dependent on knowing the
pK<sub>a</sub> values of the ionizable groups in the structure.  In fact, many
unusually high or low pK<sub>a</sub> values occur within the active sites of
proteins [Ondrechen&nbsp;2001], often depending on this unusual environment to
carry out the enzymatic activity.</p>

<p>
A pK<sub>a</sub> value is defined as <i>-log<sub>10</sub> K<sub>a</sub></i>
where K<sub>a</sub> is the acid dissociation constant.  It can be thought of as
a combination of a particular group's <i>intrinsic</i> pK<sub>a</sub> and an
environmental modifier.  The intrinsic pK<sub>a</sub> is the value measured for
the group in isolation, in solution, as:</p>

<p style="text-align:center">
<i>pK<sub>a</sub> = -log<sub>10</sub> ( [H<sup>+</sup>][A<sup>-</sup>] / [HA]
)</i>
</p>
<p>
where <i>[H<sup>+</sup>]</i> is the concentration of hydrogen ions (protons),
<i>[A<sup>-</sup>]</i> is the concentration of conjugate base and <i>[HA]</i>
the concentration of the acidic compound.  The environmental component depends
on the number of hydrogen bonds, electrostatic interactions, and solvent
contacts made by the group.</p>

<p>
Most commonly, pK<sub>a</sub> values are predicted by numerically solving the
Linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation
[Antosiewicz&nbsp;1996][Bashford&nbsp;1990].  A pK<sub>a</sub>
shift is computed from the electrostatic energy change between its charged and
neutral form and adding it to the intrinsic pK<sub>a</sub>. A recent work
[Ohno&nbsp;2006] uses linear-scaling molecular orbital calculations to achieve
the same goal. These models are often capable of predicting pK<sub>a</sub> values
to within a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 1 or better. Unfortunately, these
approaches are computationally expensive.</p>
<p>
The PROPKA method is based upon empirical shifts in pK<sub>a</sub> values
associated with the different types of interactions that each group may make, and
so can be computed very rapidly as a simple pairwise scoring function.
Specifically:</p>

<!-- LATEX residuepka/pKa_function \[
pK_{a} = pK_{intrinsic} + \Delta pK_{Des} + \Delta pK_{HB} + \Delta pK_{chgchg}

<h3>Titratable Groups and Group Types</h3>

<p>Before any computations can be carried out, all titratable groups in the
structure must be identified.  This is done by considering the hybridization
and bonding patterns of N, O and S atoms and is quite thorough.  Note that a
group marked as titratable could end up being so acidic or so basic that in
practice it is always protonated/deprotonated as appropriate.  However at
this stage we are just concerned with identifying a reasonable set of groups
with which to carry out the calculations.  Metal ions and halogens, while not
considered titratable here, are included as they partake in charge-charge
interactions with other titratable groups (see below).</p>

<p>Some of the parameters in PROPKA, including the intrinsic pK<sub>a</sub>, and
the distance cutoffs for local desolvation, depend on a more precise
specification of the titratable groups.  Hence after identifying the groups,
they are matched up to more specific group types, such as <i>imidazole,
guanidinium, phenol, carboxyls of varying lengths</i> and so on.  Any groups
which cannot be identified at this point have a default set of parameters
assigned.</p>

<h3>Desolvation</h3>

<p>Carboxyl groups in the protein interior often have higher
pK<sub>a</sub> values than normal, while buried positive charges tend to
have lower pK<sub>a</sub> values, in each case increasing the tendency for the
group to stay neutral rather than become charged.  This is at least in
part due to the high energetic cost of burying a charge.  In the present
method, a buried group is defined as <i>N<sub>15.5 &Aring;</sub> &gt; 400</i>,
where <i>N<sub>15.5 &Aring;</sub></i> is the number of heavy atoms within a
15.5 &Aring; radius of the centroid of the titratable group.  Atoms from the
group in question are excluded from the count.  The desolvation
shift to the pK<sub>a</sub> is composed of a global term, which is a function
of <i>N<sub>15.5 &Aring;</sub></i> and non-zero only for buried groups, and a
local term, which counts the number of atoms within a smaller radius, where the
radius varies depending on group type.</p>



<h3>Hydrogen Bonds</h3>

<p>Hydrogen bonds are usually the largest of the three shift terms, and are
identified purely on a spatial distance basis.  For hydrogen bonds to the
protein backbone, the bond angle is taken into account as well.  Certain buried
hydrogen bonds are particularly strong and receive an extra high shift, such as
His-carboxyl or carboxyl-carboxyl.  At present, no attempt is made to identify
which O in a carboxyl, or N in a His, is making the hydrogen bond - both are
tested and the most favorable one is always chosen.  A particularly strong
interaction may occur in the case of the guanidinium group, which can
simultaneously make two hydrogen bonds to the two oxygens of a carboxyl.
For certain hydrogen bonds, both the acceptor and donor affect each other, and
in other cases only one is shifted.</p>

<h3>Buried Charge-Charge</h3>

<p>This type of interaction is quite rare, as it only occurs between two buried
groups (as defined above) within 7 &Aring; of each other.  It is treated
effectively in the same way as for hydrogen bonds, increasing the pK<sub>a</sub>
of one group and/or decreasing that of the other.</p>


<h3>Iteration</h3>

<p>The prediction algorithm works by computing and summing up all the terms in
Eqn.(1) to arrive at an initial set of pK<sub>a</sub> values.  Then the iterative
phase begins.  In this phase, the charge-charge interactions and the hydrogen
bond terms between groups with similar pK<sub>a</sub> values are recomputed, and
generally the group with the higher pK<sub>a</sub> will lower that of the
interacting partner, while its own pK<sub>a</sub> will increase by a
corresponding amount.  Once this is done for all relevant pairwise
interactions, the process is repeated until it converges, i.e. no more
changes occur and self-consistency has been reached.  Normally this happens
after two or three iterations, since there are usually very few groups involved
in the process.  The resulting converged solution is then returned to the user.</p>


<h3>Differences from PROPKA</h3>

<p>As mentioned above, the method is based heavily on PROPKA.  However some
modifications have been made to improve or extend the method, and these will be
discussed here briefly.</p>

<ul>
<li>Titratable groups have been somewhat generalized, so that, for example,
any carboxyl group can receive a prediction, and not just those that belong to
standard amino acid sidechains.</li>
<li>Metal ions and halogens can contribute to the charge-charge component for
nearby ionizable groups.</li>
<li>Unrecognized groups that appear to be ionizable will receive a prediction
but with a star (*) next to it to indicate that it is unreliable.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Run"></a>
<h2>Running the Application</h2>


<p>Before making use of the application, please be aware that the PROPKA
method is parameterized and largely intended to be used on proteins only. 
While it will produce predictions for some types of small molecules, nucleic 
acids, and post-translationally modified amino acids, the results are expected
to be less reliable in these cases.  To open the Residue pKa panel, select
<span class="menu">MOE | Compute | Prepare | Residue pKa</span>.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="residuepka/residuepka_panel.png" /></p>

<table width="100%" cellpadding="5">
<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Atoms</b></td>
<td valign="top">
The atoms that you wish to perform pK<sub>a</sub> prediction on; other atoms
in the system will be ignored.  By default, All Atoms are included.  Press the
<b>?</b> to the right to briefly select (in the MOE window) the specified
atoms. The atom collection can be manually specified by selecting the
appropriate atoms in the MOE window and choosing Selected Atoms from the list.
If <b>Visible Only</b> is on, then hidden atoms will be excluded from the
calculations.  In all cases, dummy atoms and atoms flagged as inert will be
ignored.</td>

<tr>
<td valign="top"><span class="menu">Titratable groups</span>
<td valign="top">
The main portion of the panel displays a list of all the titratable groups in
the currently selected atom set.  If there are none, a message to this effect
will appear, otherwise, several pieces of information will be shown, with one
row per titratable group.

<ul>
<li>
<b>Residue:</b> The residue containing the group, indicated by the chain
number, followed by a colon and the residue name and UID.</li>

<li>
<b>Atom:</b> The name of the atom attached to the ionizable hydrogen, within
the residue.  In the case of a carboxyl or other symmetric group, one atom is
chosen as the <i>representative</i> however it remains ambiguous as to which
atom actually gets protonated/deprotonated.</li>

<li>
<b>El:</b> Element symbol for the stated atom.</li>

<li>
<b>Bur:</b> A <tt>b</tt> here indicates the residue is buried.</li>

<li>
<b>Forced:</b> If a forced pK<sub>a</sub> has been supplied (see next section)
it will be displayed here.  A ? indicates that no forced value has been
specified (default).</li>

<li>
<b>pKa:</b> The predicted pK<sub>a</sub> value.  A value of '-' means <i>not
yet predicted</i> and is the initial value for all atoms.  Other possible
values include <i>cation</i> and <i>anion</i>.  Although these are normally
used to refer to positively and negatively charged ions, respectively, in this
case the meaning is slightly different.  A cation is simply a group which
lowers the pK<sub>a</sub> of nearby groups that it interacts with, while not
being titratable itself, while an anion is any group which increases the
pK<sub>a</sub> of interacting groups while not being titratable itself.  These
could also be thought of as having pK<sub>a</sub> values of +&infin; and
-&infin; respectively.</li>

<li>
<b>Unk:</b> a star (*) will appear in this column if a given pK<sub>a</sub>
prediction is unreliable due to the group type (e.g. carboxyl, imidazole) not
being recognized. This is blank until a prediction is made.</li>
</ul>

<p>
If the <b>Synchronize</b> box is on, then selecting atoms in the listbox will
also select them in the MOE window, and selecting ionizable atoms in the MOE
window will select corresponding items in the listbox.  If the <b>Label</b> box
is on, the atoms which are selected in the listbox will have their
pK<sub>a</sub> displayed as a label in the MOE window.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Forced pK<sub>a</sub></b>
<td valign="top">
When one or more titratable groups are selected in the listbox, this becomes
active.  Entering a number and clicking <b>Apply</b> will set the <b>Forced</b>
column for all selected atoms to the entered value.  Similarly, clicking
<b>+</b> will set them to <i>cation</i> and clicking <b>-</b> will set them to
<i>anion</i>.  Clicking <b>?</b> will return the selected atoms to the default
state (no forced value).  When a pK<sub>a</sub> value is forced, then once the
iterative stage of the algorithm is reached, the pK<sub>a</sub> is fixed to the
forced value.  This not only results in the final predicted pK<sub>a</sub>
being the same as the forced one, but in addition affects its interacting
neighbors during the iterative stage.  Typically this should only be used when
one has prior knowledge about some of the pK<sub>a</sub> values in the system.

Press the <b>Predict</b> button to carry out the prediction with the
currently displayed set of titratable groups.  The <b>pKa</b> column should
fill almost instantly (very large structures may take several seconds
however).</p>
<p>
Pressing the <b>Protonate...</b> button brings up the Protonate panel,
discussed below.  The <b>Report...</b> button brings up a

terminates the Residue pKa application.</p>


<a name="RunReport"></a>
<h2>Prediction Report</h2>

<p>The report generated by the <b>Report...</b> button always refers to the
most recent prediction run.  It is essentially an expanded version of what
appears in the listbox for each titratable group.  The columns and their
meanings are as follows:</p>


<table>
<tr valign="top">
<td><b>Type</b></td>
<td>A short code to indicate what type of ionizable group the atom was flagged

<p>Since <tt>His</tt> residues have two pK<sub>a</sub> values predicted
for them, these both show up in the report.  The second pK<sub>a</sub>

'His neutral', and will usually be very high.</p>


<a name="RunProtonate"></a>
<h2>Protonate Panel</h2>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="residuepka/protonate_panel.png" /></p>

<p>The Protonate Panel is used to actually modify the structure in the MOE
window once pK<sub>a</sub> values have been predicted for it.  Given a pH, it will
modify the ionization of all titratable groups, under the assumption that any
groups with pK<sub>a</sub> &lt; pH are deprotonated and those with
pK<sub>a</sub> &gt; pH are protonated.</p>

<table width="100%" cellpadding="5">

<td valign="top"><b>pH</b></td>
<td valign="top">
Set here the pH for the protonation state you wish to have set.  If <b>Label

name and charge after you click <b>OK</b>.  If <b>Add Hydrogens</b> is on,
explicit hydrogens will be added according to the new protonation state, once
you click <b>OK</b>.  Otherwise hydrogens will remain unchanged.  Note that
when this option is off, <i>only</i> the ionization of the titratable atoms is
modified, so you could end up in the situation of a deprotonated atom with its
hydrogen still attached!  In this case, manually adding hydrogens again from the
main menu will yield the correct result (choose <span class="menu">MOE | Edit |

</td></tr></table>
<p>
Click <b>OK</b> to proceed with the operation.  You will be asked to confirm
that you really want to modify the structure.  The pK<sub>a</sub> values
from the most recent prediction will always be used.  If any atoms lack a
prediction then they will be skipped.  If no predictions have been made
yet, a message to this effect will be shown - click <b>Predict</b> in the main
panel and try again. Clicking <b>Cancel</b> will close the Protonate Panel
without making any changes.</p>


<a name="Example"></a>
<h2>Worked Example</h2>

<p>
In this section we will present an example calculation with the
Residue pKa application.  PDE4B2B complexed with Rolipram (PDB 1RO6) will
be used in the example:</p>

<div class="example">
<ol>
<li>Clear the molecular data in MOE with
<span class="menu">MOE | File | Close</span> and ensure that there are no
running tasks (use the <b>Cancel</b> menu in the MOE window).


<li>Load Rolipram with <span class="menu">MOE | File | Open</span> and
select <tt>$MOE/sample/mol/1ro6.pdb</tt>.


<li>Identify the active site with the Site Finder application:
select <span class="menu">MOE | Compute | Site Finder</span> and press <b>Apply</b>.
In the list of sites, select only the first site and select
<b>Isolate: Atoms and Backbone</b> to view the active site.  Then
press <b>Close</b> to close the Site Finder application.

</ol>
</div>

<div class="example">
<a name="ExamplePredict"></a>
<h3>Example: Predicting pK<sub>a</sub> values in the Active Site</h3>

<p>
With the Rolipram system set up as described above, start the Residue pKa
application by selecting
<span class="menu">MOE | Compute | Prepare | Residue pKa</span>.
<p>
In the listbox you should see a list of all the titratable atoms in the
structures.

<ol>
<li>Check the <b>Synchronize</b> box.  This will help you
find atoms you select in the listbox more quickly in the MOE window.
<p><li>Check the <b>Label</b> box.  This will cause atoms selected in the
listbox to have their predicted pK<sub>a</sub> values displayed in the MOE
window once a prediction is made.
<p><li>
Click <b>Predict</b>.  The <b>pKa</b> column will fill with the predicted values.
<p><li>
To view the predictions for only the atoms which are currently visible, select
<b>Visible Only</b> at the top of the panel.  Note if you
had selected this <i>before</i> making the prediction, the prediction would
have been made <i>only</i> on this set of atoms, ignoring the presence of all
other atoms.  This would result in greatly different, and of course incorrect,
predictions.  It is important that when you click <b>Predict</b>, the
entire set of atoms you wish to consider is selected at the top of the panel,
and displayed in the listbox.

</p>

<p>
Note that HIS 234, HIS 238, HIS 274 and HIS 278 all have unusually low
pK<sub>a</sub> values.  This is the pK<sub>a</sub> for pulling the first
hydrogen off, changing them from positively charged to neutral.  Histidine has
a second pK<sub>a</sub> value as well, for pulling off the second hydrogen and
making it negatively charged.  Normally this is quite high, but because the
pK<sub>a</sub> values are lowered so drastically in this environment, some of the HIS
residues may in fact be negatively charged in this case (as we shall see). 
Let's try to see why they are so strongly acidic.</p>

</p>
<p>You should now clearly see a zinc 
ion, with charge +2, and the nearby histidine residues with
their pK<sub>a</sub> values labeled.  Clearly the interaction with the metal
ion has the effect of lowering the pK<sub>a</sub> dramatically.</p></li>

<li> Let's look in a bit more detail.  Click the <b>Report...</b> button and
examine the rows for these HIS residues to see where the greatest contribution
comes from (see above for a description of the report format).  HIS 234 gets a
total of -5.30 from burial and -8.22 from charge-charge interaction (presumably
with the metal), and HIS 238 gets -6.42 from burial and -2.00 from
charge-charge. The other two HIS residues have similar contributions from burial
and charge-charge contributions.  Thus we can conclude
that the low pK<sub>a</sub> is a result of the combination of being deeply
buried and close to the positively charged metal atom.  Close the report by
selecting <span class="menu">File | Quit</span> from its menu.</li>

<li>
Click <b>OK</b>.  Confirm that you really want to do this by clicking
<b>Yes</b> in the dialog that appears.  Note the whole protein is affected, not
just the visible portion, since we performed the prediction step on <b>All
Atoms</b>.</li>

<p>
You may now click <b>Close</b> on the Residue pK<sub>a</sub> panel if you wish. 
Examine the active site now, in the area around the metal ions.  You should see
two deprotonated (negatively charged) carboxyl groups pointing directly towards
the metal. In addition, observe the four HIS residues.  HIS 234, HIS 278,
HIS 238 and HIS 274
each have a single protonated nitrogen and thus are neutral.  In total, then,
there are two negative charges to exactly neutralize the charge of +2 from the
metal, making the active site neutral at pH 7.4.  Note that although MOE
only displays the first pK<sub>a</sub> for the histidine residues, it does
compute the second one as well, for the purposes of determining the proper
protonation state.</p>
