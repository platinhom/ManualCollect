<p>
The Energy Minimize application in MOE calculates atomic coordinates that are
local minima of a potential energy function.  Energy minimization is useful
for molecule building, determining low energy conformations, conformational
search and preparation for molecular dynamics simulations.
The supported energy functions are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The current MOE forcefield (e.g. Amber, Amber12EHT, CHARMM, MMFF94, etc.)
</li><li>
The MOPAC semi-empirical energy functions (e.g. PM3, AM1, MNDO)
</li><li>
Third party quantum mechanical (QM) engines such as Gaussian, GAMESS, ADF, etc.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The MOPAC and third party QM energy functions are fundamentally different
from molecular mechanics forcefields in that they do not view the
molecular topology as fixed.  This allows them to simulate chemical
reactions or other structural rearrangements.
For information on configuring MOPAC to run in MOE,
please see the section on
<a href="scf.htm#MOPAC">MOPAC Engine</a>.  For information on configuring
third party engines, please see the section on the
<a href="scf.htm#Configuration">appropriate program</a>.
</p>

<p>In forcefield minimization, the Energy Minimize application is
capable of calculating constrained geometries through the use of MOE's
chiral, distance, angle and dihedral restraints.  In addition, atoms may
be constrained with a tether or fixed during the calculation.
</p>


<a name="Theory"></a>
<h2>Theory</h2>

<p>
Energy minimization consists of finding a set of atomic coordinates
that correspond to a local minimum of the molecular energy function (such
as the potential energy model).  This is done by applying large scale non-linear
optimization techniques to calculate a conformation (near to the starting
geometry) for which the forces on the atoms are zero.
</p>
<p>
<b>Forcefield Optimization</b>.
Non-linear optimization algorithms typically have the following structure
[Gill&nbsp;1981].   Let <span class='LaTeX'>\(x_{k}\)</span> denote the vector of
atomic coordinates at step <span class='LaTeX'>\(k\)</span> of the procedure and let
<span class='LaTeX'>\(U\)</span>
be the energy function.  Then,
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<i>Test for convergence</i>.
If the convergence criteria are satisfied (see below), then
<span class='LaTeX'>\(x_{k}\)</span> is returned.
</li>
<li>
<i>Compute the search direction</i>.
Compute a non-zero vector <span class='LaTeX'>\(p_{k}\)</span> called the
<i>search direction</i>.
</li>
<li>
<i>Compute the step size</i>.
Compute a non-zero scalar <span class='LaTeX'>\(a_{k}\)</span>, called the
<i>step size</i>, for which 
<span class='LaTeX'>\(U\left(x_{k} + a_{k} p_{k}\right) < U\left(x_{k}\right)\)</span>.
</li>
<li>
<i>Advance</i>.
Set <span class='LaTeX'>\(x_{k+1} = x_{k}\)</span>
and
<span class='LaTeX'>\(k = k+1\)</span> and go to Step 1.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
The step size in Step&nbsp;3 is computed by using a safeguarded bicubic
interpolation search along the search direction.  In Step&nbsp;1, the
optimization is terminated when any of the following three conditions
are satisfied:
</p>

<ol>
<li><i>Root Mean Square gradient Test</i>:
<span class='LaTeX'>\(\left| \nabla U\left(x_{k}\right) \right| < e_{A} \sqrt{n}\)</span>,
where <span class='LaTeX'>\(e_{A}\)</span> is a predefined
constant and <span class='LaTeX'>\(n\)</span> is the number of unfixed atoms.
</li>

<li>
<i>Iteration Limit Test</i>:
<span class='LaTeX'>\(k > K\)</span>, where <span class='LaTeX'>\(K\)</span>
is a predefined upper limit on the maximum number of iterations.
</li>

<li>
<i>Progress Tests</i>:
The following three conditions are simultaneously satisfied:

<span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{align}
U\left(x_{k-1}\right) - U\left(x_{k}\right) &< T \left( 1 + \left| U\left(x_{k}\right) \right| \right)
\\
\left| x_{k-1} - x_{k} \right| &< T^{1/2} \left( 1 + \left| x_{k} \right| \right)
\\
\left| \nabla U\left(x_{k}\right) \right| &\leq T^{1/3} \left( 1 + \left| U\left(x_{k}\right) \right| \right)
\end{align}
</span>

<p>In these conditions, <span class='LaTeX'>\(T\)</span> is a predefined constant indicating the
number of significant figures in <span class='LaTeX'>\(U\)</span> that are required (the
<i>function test</i>). For example, if <span class='LaTeX'>\(T=10^{-6}\)</span>
then six figures of accuracy are required.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
If the iteration limit is exceeded then it is typically due to a failure
of the algorithm.  Note that saddle points satisfy criterion 1; the
conformation should be perturbed slightly and optimization restarted.
If criterion 3 is satisfied then it is very likely that a local minimum
has been achieved.
</p>
<p>
The choice of search direction <span class='LaTeX'>\(p_{k}\)</span> in Step 2 is what
distinguishes the different nonlinear optimization methods.  MOE uses
a succession of three methods to effect an energy minimization: Steepest
Descent (SD), Conjugate Gradient (CG) and Truncated Newton (TN).
In SD optimization
<span class='LaTeX'>\(p_{k} = - \nabla U\left(x_{k}\right)\)</span>;
that is, the search proceeds along the direction of the forces.
While intuitive, SD is extremely inefficient after a few iterations and
it is only used when the gradient is extremely high.  When the gradient
is sufficiently small (but still quite high) the CG method is used.
The Conjugate Gradient (CG) method improves upon SD by choosing the
next search direction in a way to not undo the progress accomplished
by the previous step. CG performs well in strained conditions; however, it
exhibits poor convergence properties.  Once the gradient is reasonable,
the TN method is used.
</p>
<p>The Truncated Newton (TN) method is the most efficient large-scale
nonlinear optimization method known.  It exhibits superlinear convergence
even in highly nonlinear conditions.  The Truncated Newton method attempts
to use curvature information to improve convergence.  The Newton
direction <span class='LaTeX'>\(p\)</span> satisfies:</p>

<span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{equation}
G_{k} \left(x_{k}\right) p = -\nabla U \left(x_{k}\right)
\end{equation}
</span>

<p>where <span class='LaTeX'>\(G_{k}\)</span> is the second derivative, or Hessian, of
<span class='LaTeX'>\(U\)</span>.
These equations are called the Newton equations.
TN solves the Newton equations approximately using an iterative linear
equation solver. The iterative linear equation solver (based on the Linear
Conjugate Gradient method) is terminated after a few
iterations; hence the name Truncated Newton.
</p>
<p>
<b>Quantum Mechanical Optimization</b>.
Using the external MOPAC semi-empirical QM program [Stewart&nbsp;1993],
calculations can use PM3, AM1, MNDO or MINDO/3 as the energy model.
Third party QM programs such as Gaussian or GAMESS (reference below)
provide a wide range of energy models: semi-empirical, Hartree-Fock,
post-Hartree-Fock or Density Functional Theory (DFT).  These programs
are parameterized for much of the periodic table, and can calculate
geometries,
transition states, vibrational spectra, thermodynamic quantities and force
constants for molecules, radicals and ions.
They also use different optimization methodology
from MOE and a complete description is beyond the scope of this document.

<h2>Running an Energy Minimization</h2>

<p>
In general, the following steps should be taken to locate an energy minimum:
</p>
<ol>
<p><li>
Select and configure the forcefield and related parameters with the
<span class="menu">MOE | Footer | <i>forcefield</i></span> button.
Configure the periodic system parameters with
<span class="menu">MOE | Footer | PBC</span>,
the periodic boundary conditions button (if the crystal parameters
have been set, the button label will be the current space group).
</li></p>

<p><li>
Add Hydrogens and Lone Pair atoms as required using 
the <span class="menu">MOE | Edit | Build | Hydrogens | Add Hydrogens</span> menu
items.  
Alternatively, the Energy Minimize panel can add/remove hydrogen and lone 
pair atoms as required by the current forcefield.
</li></p>

<p><li>
Decide which atoms are to be held fixed in space (i.e. frozen during
the minimization calculation).  Fixed atoms can be detected using
<span class="menu">MOE | Select | Potential | Fixed</span> and modified with
<span class="menu">MOE | Edit | Potential | Fix</span> or
<span class="menu">MOE | Edit | Potential | Unfix</span>.
If a large protein is in a highly strained state, it is a good idea to
fix the backbone or C-alpha atoms.
Alternatively, the Energy Minimize panel also allows temporary (only in effect
during minimization) tethers to be set up for common situations.
</li></p>

<p><li>
Decide if restraints are to be added to the system (to constrain geometry).
Use <span class="menu">MOE | Edit | Potential | Restrain</span> to add
distance, angle and dihedral restraints.  
Use
<span class="menu">MOE | Footer | <i>forcefield</i> | Restraints</span>
to review or delete restraints.
</li></p>
</ol>

<p>
When ready to perform the energy minimization, choose
<span class="menu">MOE | Compute | Energy Minimize</span> and the Energy
Minimize window will appear.  The panel has four &quot;modes&quot; each of
which can be selected by pressing on the vertical mode selector on the
left side of the window:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>General.</b>
Forcefield minimization (default) with emphasis on tether layers.
</li><li><b>Domain.</b>
Forcefield minimization with emphasis on rigid body classes.
</li><li><b>MOPAC.</b>
Semi-empirical energy minimization using MOPAC.
</li><li><b>QM.</b>
Quantum Mechanics minimization using third party SCF engines.

with UHF (Unrestricted Hartree-Fock).

<td valign="top"><b>Method</b></td>
<td valign="top">
The computational method that will be used for the calculation.  These
include Semi-Empirical, Hartree-Fock, Density Functional Theory and/or
post-Hartree-Fock options.  Each SCF engine provides a range of methods
of varying cost and complexity.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Multi-step Convergence</b></td>
<td valign="top">
If on, a multi-step calculation is performed to increase the likelihood of
successful geometry optimization.  This is described in
<a href="scf.htm#MultiStep">SCF Wavefunctions</a>.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Geometry Optimization</b></td>
<td valign="top">
<b>Geometry Optimization</b> is active when <b>Input Data</b> is set to
<span class="nobr"><b>MDB File</b></span>.  If on, the output energy will
reflect the minimized structure otherwise it reflects the input structure.
This provids a means of calculating QM energies for databases.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Linear&nbsp;Scaling</b></td>
<td valign="top">
If on and supported by the SCF engine, linear scaling methods will be
used.  This makes calculations on large-scale possible in reasonable
amounds of time and can result in some loss of precision.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Keep&nbsp;QM&nbsp;Files</b></td>
<td valign="top">
If on, the input and output files from the SCF calculation will be retained.
These will be saved in the execution directory whose name is drawn from the
Wavefunction file (if specified) or in the directory specified by the
<tt>TMP</tt> constant.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Update Connectivity</b></td>
<td valign="top">
If on, the topology of the system is recalculated when the minimization
completes:
bonds, hybridization, ionization and hint LP values are determined from
the resulting geometry. This is typically used after a chemical reaction
has taken place.
</td></tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Solvent&nbsp;Model</b></td>
<td valign="top">
Many computational engines support one or more types of solvent models in
order to mimic the effect of being in solution. When available, the solvent
model may be selected from a list, and the dielectric (&epsilon;) and
solute radius may be tweaked as necessary.

If available, additional engine-specific keywords can be specified to affect
the calculation.  Consult the third party documentation
manual for a description of supported keywords.

<td valign="top"><b>View&nbsp;QM<br />Input&nbsp;File</b></td>
<td valign="top">
The input file that will be given to the SCF engine will be opened in a
text editor.

<td valign="top"><b>Save Settings</b></td>
<td valign="top">
Pressing <b>Save Settings</b> saves the current settings of the
<span class="nobr"><b>Energy Minimize</b></span> panel as the new defaults.
These defaults are also used by the
<span class="nobr"><b>SCF Calculation</b></span> and
<span class="nobr"><b>Conformational Search</b></span> applications.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Standard Settings</b></td>
<td valign="top">
Pressing <b>Standard Settings</b> restores the settings of the
<span class="nobr"><b>Energy Minimize</b></span> panel to the original
default values for the current SCF engine.
These defaults are also used by the
<span class="nobr"><b>SCF Calculation</b></span> and
<span class="nobr"><b>Conformational Search</b></span> applications.

Press <b>OK</b> to begin the calculation. 
<b>Warning!</b> The QM calculation requirements
scale as the fourth power of the number of basis functions, possibly higher
for post-Hartree-Fock calculations.  Depending on the choice of basis
set and method, these calculations may take quite a lot of time to complete.

<h2>Database Minimization</h2>

In many instances, a database contains a collection of molecules whose
structures should be energy minimized.  To do this, set the desired
forcefield via <span class="menu">MOE | Footer |
<a href="../moe/pot.htm"><i>forcefield</i></a></span>.  Open the database
in the
<a href="../mdb/db.htm"><span class="nobr"><b>Database Viewer</b></span></a>
and choose 
<span class="menu">DBV | Compute | Molecule | Energy Minimize</span>.
This opens the <span class="nobr"><b>Energy Minimize</b></span> panel
with the appropriate settings for
<span class="nobr"><b>Input Data</b></span>:

<p align="center">
<img src="emin/ff_page3.png" alt="DBV General" /></p>

All the previously described methods and options can be used for the
minimization.  Press <b>OK</b> to start the calculation.  Progress
information is displayed in the MOE window and written to the
<span class="nobr"><b>SVL Commands</b></span> window.
