<p>The <b>Protomers</b> panel is an interactive means for viewing tautomers and
protomers.
When the panel opens, a reference molecule is obtained from the
contents of the MOE Window, and its tautomers/protomers are enumerated and
displayed in the panel.  To open the panel, use
<nobr><b>MOE | Compute | Prepare | Protomers.</b></nobr>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> If multiple ligands are <a href="ligx.htm#System">active</a>
or if the ligand exceeds 100 heavy atoms, the Protomers panel will
be empty when it opens. If more than one ligand is active,
either activate only one (using <span class="menu">MOE | RHS |
<a href="ligx.htm#System">System</a></span>)
and then 
select <b>Apply</b> or choose a different set of source atoms.
If the ligand comprises more than 100 heavy atoms,
you can select <b>Apply</b> in the <b>Protomers</b> panel
and select Yes when asked 
to continue to allow for larger ligands.
</p>

<p>
Note: The <a href="../moe/molsystems/build.htm">Builder</a>
can also be used to view and change the tautomeric state of a molecule.
</p>

<p align="center"><img src="protoview/protoview_panel.png"></p>

<p>The tautomer and protomer enumeration algorithm is implemented by
the function <tt>ctab_EnumerateProtomers</tt>, documented in the <a
href="../mdb/wash.htm">Database Wash</a> manual, and also used by the
<tt>sdwash</tt> command line tool. Tautomers of a molecule are formed by
migration of hydrogen atoms and bond orders to form isomeric species,
while protomers are formed by addition or removal of acidic protons.
The rules for generating these species are designed so that whenever
possible, the only species produced  are those which are both kinetically
accessible and thermodynamically viable, relative to the original
reference structure.

<p>The panel consists of several parts:

<ul>

<p><li>Enumeration controls (top), which specify the source of the reference
structure, and how to generate and rank the tautomers/protomers

<p><li>The tautomers and protomers (middle), which take up most of the panel

<p><li>Post-filters, display options and navigation controls (bottom)

</ul>

<p>The panel controls are described as follows:

<p><table border="0" cellspacing="5" width="100%">

<tr><td valign="top"><b>Source</b>

</td><td>The atoms used to compose the reference molecule may be selected. The
default value, <b>Ligand&nbsp;Atoms</b>, excludes atoms which are classified as
receptor or solvent. Other options include: Selected Atoms, Selected Residues, 
Selected Chains and Ligand tags. All options in the source menu except 
<b>Ligand Atoms</b> ignore the
<a href="ligx.htm#System">active state</a> of the molecule.

</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><b>Mode</b>

</td><td>If <b>Tautomers</b> is selected, the mode of enumeration is limited to
tautomers, which are formed by migration of hydrogen atoms and bond orders. All
of the molecular species will have the same formula and total charge as the
reference molecule. If <b>Protomers</b> is selected, the enumeration will
also include protonation states formed by adding or subtracting protons to any
of the enumerated tautomers. The formulae of the enumerated species may differ
by total charge and number of hydrogen atoms.

</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><b>3D</b>

</td><td>By default, the classification of tautomers is "2D", which means that
the labeled chemical graphs are the only distinguishing features of the
enumerated protomers. The enumerated list is ranked by a rough scoring system
(e.g. ketones tend to be favored over enols, aromatic rings are
preferred, etc.). Redundant chemical graphs are removed, i.e. if two molecular
species have the same canonical SMILES identifier, only one is retained.

<p>If the <b>3D</b> box is enabled, then the original coordinates are
included in the calculation of
the rank ordering of the enumerated species &ndash;
the actual bond distances are compared to
the expected bond distances for
single, double or aromatic bonds, and the
planarity of <i>sp<sup>2</sup></i> and
<i>sp<sup>3</sup></i> centers is taken into account.
</p>

</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><b>Receptor</b>

</td><td>When the <b>3D</b> box is checked, the <b>Receptor</b> can be selected.
By default the value is <tt>None</tt>, which produces no additional effect. If
it is changed to non-blank value, such as <tt>Receptor Atoms</tt>, the effects
of a receptor such as the host protein are taken into account when rank-ordering
the enumerated species. Protomers which are well placed to participate in a
significant hydrogen bonding interaction with the receptor are prioritized and
appear near the beginning of the list.

</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><b>Structures</b>

</td><td>The enumerated species are displayed in the main part of the panel as a
matrix of buttons. The button which corresponds to the reference molecule from
which the protomers were enumerated is drawn with a highlighted background. The
molecules are drawn in the buttons so that the heavy atoms are depicted in the
same way in each case, but the bond orders and hydrogen counts differ. The atoms
which are involved in any kind of change anywhere in the series are drawn in
blue, while those which are not ever affected by a change are drawn in black.

<p>Clicking on any of the buttons will offer to copy the modified protomer to
the MOE Window. When possible, this will use the original atoms, and only
modify the charge and bond order of the heavy atoms, and adjust the explicit
hydrogen atoms accordingly.

</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><b>Show&nbsp;Acids/Bases</b>

</td><td>By default, the results of the protomer enumeration are shown in their
entirety. If the acid checkbox is turned off, then all structures which contain
a functional group classified as a "strong acid" are excluded. Similarly, if the
base checkbox is turned off, then structures with a "strong base" are excluded.

</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><b>Page&nbsp;Size</b>

</td><td>The number of protomers displayed on a page may be controlled by
selecting one of the dimensions, which include 2x1, 4x2, 6x3 and 8x4. For the
more densely packed page sizes, it may be necessary to adjust the size of the
panel in order to see the molecules.

</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><b>Navigation</b>

</td><td>If there are more protomers than will fit on a single page, then the
navigation buttons become available for skipping through pages. Arrows for
first, previous, next and last will be active when they apply. Alternatively, a
page number may be entered in the text box, and pressing <tt>ENTER</tt> will
jump to that page. The total number of tautomers or protomers is displayed to
the right.

</td></tr></table>

<p>For the enumeration controls (source, mode, receptor), it is necessary to
press the <b>Update</b> button in order to apply the changes. The enumeration
process is typically instantaneous for molecules with only several tautomers or
protomers, but since the number of distinct structures grows exponentially with
the number of tautomer/protomer sites, the calculation can take several seconds
for more complicated reference molecules.

<p>The <b>Print</b> is available for printing the currently generated set of
structures.
