Flexible Alignment is an application for flexibly aligning small molecules
[Labute&nbsp;2001]. The method accepts as input a collection of small molecules
with 3D coordinates and computes a collection of alignments.  Each alignment is
given a score that quantifies the quality of the alignment in terms of both
internal strain and overlap of molecular features [Chan&nbsp;2010].

<p>
<b>Note:</b>
The scoring scheme changed in the 2009 release.
The pre-2009 scoring scheme can be restored by copying the file
<tt>$MOE/lib/svl/calc.svl/flexalgn.svl</tt> and making a small
modification to it:
change the value of the constant <tt>OLD</tt> from 0 to 1.

<pre>
    const OLD = 1;	// set to 1 for the pre-2009 scheme
</pre>

This line is near the top of the file.
Save the modified file and load it:

<pre>
    svl> load 'flexalgn.svl'
</pre>

The old scheme is now in effect.

in parallel.

<h2><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>
Often, atomic-level details of the structures of pharmaceutically relevant
receptors are not available. In such cases, 3D alignment (or superposition) of
putative ligands can be used to deduce structural requirements for biological
activity. For example, CoMFA [Cramer&nbsp;1988] also uses a 3D molecular
alignment as input.  Another strategy is pharmacophore elucidation in which
several ligands are aligned and a small collection of essential molecular
features required for biological activity is derived from the alignment
(e.g. [Martin&nbsp;1993]).  Still another strategy is to use 3D molecular
alignment to search a database for ligands that have one or more conformations
that superpose well with a query molecule (e.g. [Miller&nbsp;1999]).
Methodologies based upon 3D alignment for finding biologically active ligands
generally make use of the qualitative assumption that if two ligands have
similar biological activity and bind in similar modes, then the bound
conformations of the two ligands align well and inferences can be made about
the nature of the receptor.

<p>
Methods for producing molecular alignments are generally judged according to
a number of criteria:

<ol>
<li>Scoring. Given an experimental alignment of two ligands of similar
activity that bind in the same mode, will the method score this alignment
best (or near best) over all other alignments? This determines whether top
scoring alignments can be used to make inferences about the nature of the
receptor.
<p>
<li>Completeness. If a high-scoring molecular alignment exists will the
method find it? This determines if a molecule can be rejected
(e.g. judged inactive) if no alignment is produced.
<p>
<li>Running Time. What is the average running time per pair of molecules? This 
determines whether the method is suitable for database searching.
</ol>

<p>
Flexible Alignment is a stochastic search procedure that simultaneously searches
the conformation space of a collection of molecules and the space of alignments
of those molecules (at a rate of a few tens of seconds per iteration).  As a
result, the method is asymptotically complete.  The scoring of alignments is
based upon a Gaussian density representation of features tuned to reproduce
certain X-ray crystallographic alignments, although it must be remembered
that experimental and modeling errors must be taken into account when making
any assessment of scoring function quality (and the degree to which bound
conformations can be calculated by 3D molecular alignment).


<h2><a name="Methodology">Methodology</a></h2>

<!-- Comment from flexalgn.svl:
// Each molecule is described by a sum of gaussian representations where
// each atom is a gaussian of the form:
//
//	Pi * (Si / 2PI)**(3/2) exp {-0.5 * Si * (x - Xi)'(x - Xi)}
//
// where Si = (2/aRi)**2, Ri is the radius of atom i, Xi is the position
// of atom i, a is a radius scale factor, and Pi is a property value.
//
// The overlap between two such gaussians is a gaussian of the form
//
//	Pi * Pj * (Sij/2PI)**(3/2) * exp {-0.5 * Sij * (Xi-Xj)'(Xi-Xj)
//
// where Sij = 4 / (Ri**2 + Rj**2).  The function Pi * Pj is regarded as
// a similarity measure. Hence, the similarity measure is defined to be
//	
//	Wij * exp {Sij * (Xi-Xj)'(Xi-Xj)}		(Sij < 0)
//
// Different properties can be added by turning Wij into a sum of different
// similarity values.  In the calculations to follow, the dissimilarity
// is actually used instead of the similarity
-->

<p>The probability density functions used in Flexible Alignment are Gaussians.
A <tt>Normal</tt>, or <tt>isotropic</tt> (spherically symmetric), Gaussian
probability density has the functional form:

<span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{align}
f\left( x \right) = s^{3} \left( 2 \pi \right)^{-\frac{3}{2}}
    \exp \left( - \frac{1}{2} \left| x - x_{0} \right|^{2} s^{2} \right)
\end{align}
</span>

<P>where <span class='LaTeX'>\(s^{2}\)</span>
is the inverse variance along each axis and
<span class='LaTeX'>\(x_{0}\)</span>
is the center (and mean) of the density.  An atom with
a nucleus located at <span class='LaTeX'>\(x_{0}\)</span>
with van der Waals radius <span class='LaTeX'>\(r\)</span> is
represented by:

<span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{align}
\left( a / r \right)^{3} \left( 2 \pi \right)^{-\frac{3}{2}}
    \exp \left( - \frac{1}{2} \left| x - x_{0} \right|^{2} \left( a/r \right)^{2} \right)
\end{align}
</span>

<P>where <span class='LaTeX'>\(a\)</span> determines how broad the density will
be. For example, if <span class='LaTeX'>\(a = 2\)</span>
then approximately 90% of the density will be
contained within one van der Waals radius of
<span class='LaTeX'>\(x_{0}\)</span>.
In general, the value of  <span class='LaTeX'>\(a\)</span>
can be used to approximate molecular
volumes, i.e. to fill in the gaps between atoms.

<P>Let <span class='LaTeX'>\(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n}\)</span>
denote the 3D positions of <span class='LaTeX'>\(n\)</span> atoms of a
molecule in a given conformation.
Let the non-negative <span class='LaTeX'>\(w_{i}\)</span>
denote the degree to which atom <span class='LaTeX'>\(i\)</span> has some
property <span class='LaTeX'>\(P\)</span> (e.g. &quot;is
aromatic&quot; or &quot;is donor&quot;).  We assign to each point in
space <span class='LaTeX'>\(x\)</span> the likelihood, expressed as a sum-of-Gaussians density,
that <span class='LaTeX'>\(x\)</span> has that property:

<span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{align}
f_{p} \left( x \right) =
    \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{w_{i}}{W}
    \left( \frac{1}{2 \pi} \frac{a^{2}}{r_{i}^{2}} \right)^{\frac{3}{2}}
    \exp \left( - \frac{a^{2}}{2} \frac{\left| x - x_{i} \right|^{2}}{r_{i}^{2}} \right)
\end{align}
</span>

<P>This density is called the <span class='LaTeX'>\(P\)</span>-<I>density</I> of the conformation.
For example, if <span class='LaTeX'>\(P\)</span> is the property &quot;is aromatic&quot; so that
<span class='LaTeX'>\(w_{i}\)</span> is 1 when atom <span class='LaTeX'>\(i\)</span>
is aromatic and 0 otherwise, then
the function <span class='LaTeX'>\(f\)</span> is the <I>aromatic density</I> of the conformation and
represents the likelihood that a given point in space is (in some sense)
aromatic.

<P>Given two <span class='LaTeX'>\(P\)</span>-densities for two given molecules or configurations, the
<I>overlap</I> of the two densities is, itself, a sum-of-Gaussians density in
the interatomic distances:

<span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{align}
\sum_{i=1}^{n}
\sum_{j=1}^{m}
    \frac{w_{i}}{W}
    \frac{v_{j}}{V}
    \left( \frac{a^{2}}{ 2 \pi \left( r_{i}^{2} + s_{j}^{2} \right) } \right)^{\frac{3}{2}}
    \exp \left( - \frac{a^{2}}{2} \frac{\left| x_{i} - y_{j} \right|^{2}}{r_{i}^{2} + s_{j}^{2}} \right)
\end{align}
</span>

<p>
The <span class='LaTeX'>\(w_{i}\)</span> encode the features of the molecule.
This overlap formulation generalizes to more than one property, or feature,
through a weighted summation of the individual overlap equations.  For example,
given three properties defined by atomic property weights,
<span class='LaTeX'>\(u\)</span>,
<span class='LaTeX'>\(v\)</span>,
<span class='LaTeX'>\(w\)</span>,
we define the similarity of two molecular conformations to be

<span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{align}
F =
\sum_{i=1}^{n}
\sum_{j=1}^{n'}
    \frac{ C_{u} u_{i} u_{j}' + C_{v} v_{i} v_{j}' + C_{w} w_{i} w_{j}'}{n n'}
    \times
    \left(
        \frac{a^{2}}{ 2 \pi \left( r_{i}^{2} + r_{j}'^{2} \right) }
    \right)^{\frac{3}{2}}
    \exp \left(
        - \frac{a^{2}}{2} \frac{\left| x_{i} - x_{j}' \right|^{2}}{r_{i}^{2} + r_{j}'^{2}}
    \right)
\end{align}
</span>

<p>
where <span class='LaTeX'>\(C_{u}\)</span>,
<span class='LaTeX'>\(C_{v}\)</span> and
<span class='LaTeX'>\(C_{w}\)</span>
are positive weights intended to emphasize or de-emphasize particular
<span class='LaTeX'>\(P\)</span>-densities.  In this way, any number of features
can be included into
similarity calculation without additional computational complexity: the
pair-wise weights need to be calculated only once.

<p>
This similarity measure, <span class='LaTeX'>\(F\)</span>,
also generalizes to more than two molecules
through the averaging of all pair-wise similarities.

<p>
Flexible Alignment is able to combine a number of atomic properties into the
similarity measure as <span class='LaTeX'>\(P\)</span>-densities:

</table></center>

<p>
The individual weights <span class='LaTeX'>\(w_{i}\)</span>
in the above table are tunable parameters.

<p>
The projected pharmacophore terms work in the same way as the atom based
terms. The same formulae are used, with the atomic positions substituted
by the positions of the projected features. The features have the
same definition as those in the 
<a href="ph4_annot.htm">Unified pharmacophore scheme</a>.

<p>
The default weights for the terms were obtained by training on about
30 sets of aligned ligands in the PDB. Each of these sets must contain
at least 4 diverse ligands. The ligands are diverse in the sense that
for any pair of ligands, the Tanimoto coefficient for the two MACSS keys
is under 0.85. For all ligand pairs associated with one protein, one
ligand (the template) is fixed and the other is flexibly aligned onto
the template. Candidate aligned configurations were generated using
only the volume overlap term. For each aligned configuration, a goodness
measure is defined as 1 if the RMSD with the correct answer is under
1 &Aring; and 0 if the RMSD is over 3 &Aring;, 
and it drops off linearly for situations
in between. Also the value of each feature term is calculated. Then,
the weights associated with each feature term is determined one by one.
At each stage, the weight of one term is under consideration. 
The correlation between the term in concern, the already decided terms, 
and the goodness function is used to determine the weight.

<p>
We are now working on a systematic protocol to obtain the default weights
from the most recent PDB. These weights may hence change in the next release.

<p>Alignments are &quot;sampled&quot; using a RIPS-style (Random Incremental
Pulse Search) procedure [Raber&nbsp;1989] that incorporates the quantitative
measure of goodness of an alignment defined above into the optimization stage:

<p>
<ol>
<li>[Perturb] Generate a conformation for each molecule by randomly
rotating bonds and inverting unconstrained chiral centers.  Perform
a rigid-body optimization of the similarity function.

<p>
<li>[Optimize] Minimize the grand alignment score <span class='LaTeX'>\(S\)</span>
<!--
-<I>kT</I>&nbsp;log&nbsp;<I>F</I>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<I>U</I> 
-->
with respect to the coordinates of all of the atoms.  
<span class='LaTeX'>\(S\)</span> is simply a combination of the similarity measure (see above),
and the average strain energy of the molecules (<span class='LaTeX'>\(U\)</span>).

<p>
<li>[Compare] If the new configuration has not been seen before (RMSD 
greater than some threshold, up to topological symmetry), then set
<span class='LaTeX'>\(k = 0\)</span>
otherwise, set
<span class='LaTeX'>\(k = k + 1\)</span>.  If
<span class='LaTeX'>\(k\)</span>
is greater than some predefined amount, terminate the search.
</ol>

<P>The termination criteria can be interpreted as follows.  Upon termination
there have been <span class='LaTeX'>\(S\)</span> consecutive attempts to
generate a new configuration
and each has failed.  This is similar to tossing a coin
<span class='LaTeX'>\(k\)</span> times and
observing &quot;heads&quot; on each toss.  The Bayes estimator for the bias
on the coin is
<span class='LaTeX'>\(\left( k+1 \right) / \left( k+2 \right)\)</span>;
thus the probability of observing
a &quot;tail&quot; (or a new configuration) is
<span class='LaTeX'>\(1/\left( k+2 \right)\)</span>. At
<span class='LaTeX'>\(k=20\)</span> this probability is less than 5%.

<P>Once the search is completed, the collection of configurations is pruned
by removing all configurations in which the average potential energy is
greater than the minimum observed average potential energy plus some
predefined threshold.

<h2><a name="Running">Running the Calculation</a></h2>

<p>
Flexible Alignment operates on all of the currently loaded molecules.  To
set up a calculation, load a collection of molecules into MOE.  Then, use
<span class="nobr"><b>MOE | Footer | <i>forcefield</i></b></span> to select
an appropriate forcefield (e.g. MMFF94 for small molecule alignment).
Open the Flexible Alignment panel by selecting
<b><nobr>MOE | Compute | Flexible Alignment</nobr></b>.
Depending on the size and number of molecules, the search may take some time.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> The speed of the calculation decreases <i>rapidly</i> with the
degree of freedom of the system. Hence for aligning multiple molecules,
if the situation allows,
one may consider using a rigid template (by fixing the template molecule)
and aligning one molecule to the template at a time, and repeat the
process for several possibilities of the rigid template.

judged best will then be first in the database.
Typically, the top scoring few alignments should be investigated.  It can
happen that a top scoring alignment also has a relatively large strain energy
in the <tt>U</tt> field.  Whether a high strain energy is evidence of a
poor alignment depends on the nature of the receptor to which the molecules
are assumed to bind. For example, higher strain energies are more acceptable
when ligands for enzymes and other catalytic receptors are submitted to
the calculation.
