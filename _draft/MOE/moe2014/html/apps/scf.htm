<a name="Background"></a>
<h2>Background</h2>

<p>
There are two main categories of algorithms for describing molecular
properties as a function of constituent atoms and their connectivity
and Cartesian coordinates.
The simpler of the two is the classical forcefield method, in which the
<span class="nobr:>"ball &amp; spring"</span>
 metaphor is applied to atoms and bonds, using parameters
trained to reproduce quantitative data. The calculation of potential energy and
gradients is computationally efficient, allowing discovery of minumum energy
geometries of huge molecular species such as proteins.

<p>The other main category includes quantum chemical (wavefunction-based)
methods, which begin by
ascribing to each atom a set of atomic orbitals, described by basis functions,
and some number of electrons to populate them. The shapes of the orbitals
defined by the chosen basis set are obtained by various means, such as exact
solutions to the Schr&ouml;dinger equation for a single electron,
or higher-level fitting to eventual observables. 

<p>Wavefunction-based methods operate by constructing an initial guess density
matrix, in terms of the atomic orbital basis functions, then iteratively
refining it using the self-consistent field (SCF) technique. At each step, the
kinetic energy, nuclear attraction and electron-electron repulsion terms are
accounted for, and a correction applied to the density until self-consistency is
achieved.

<p>While approaches to solving the SCF equation vary in terms of the
approximations which are used to achieve a realistic answer within a reasonable
time, all methods have a common set of variables: total energy,
molecular orbital eigenvalues and eigenvectors, 
density matrix and basis functions. The principal differences are
the mathematical forms chosen to describe the basis functions, the means of
calculating or approximating the electron-electron repulsion integrals, recovery
of correlation energy, calculation of gradients for geometry optimization, and a
number of other issues which affect accuracy, speed and reliability. These
issues aside, the large number of wavefunction-based calculation programs share
significant overlap in terms of input data, output data and feature set.

<p>Compared to the use of forcefields, calculation of molecular properties using
wavefunction-based methods is computationally intensive, and the necessary
compromises increase steeply with molecular size. Methods for extending the
reach of such calculations involve a combination of time-saving approximations
which may be circumstantially reasonable, improvements in the algorithms of the
rate-limiting steps, and harnessing increasing computing power.


<a name="Framework"></a>
<h2>Framework</h2>

<p>MOE provides a framework for making use of quantum chemistry calculations
which operate by producing a wavefunction using the self-consistent field (SCF)
method. The SCF features in MOE consist of panels for setting up calculations
and viewing their results, SVL functions for programmatic control, a plug-in
mechanism for adding interfaces to new packages, and a file format which
uniformly spans all supported packages.

<p>
An external application that has been interfaced to the MOE SCF framework is
referred to as an <i>SCF engine</i>. Each such engine is incorporated into the
MOE SCF framework via a single SVL function which controls access to its feature
set.  To be useful, an SCF engine must be able to operate on a collection
of atoms with starting coordinates (such as can be derived from the
MOE Window), and should output data such as total energy, eigenvalues,
basis functions and the wavefunction. Most SCF engines provide structure
optimization capabilities, and a variety of calculated properties.

<p>The SCF framework and the SVL interface functions handle all the supported
commonality between the SCF engines. The functionality exposed by any particular
SCF engine can be accessed from a common user interface in MOE, and the same set
of functions in SVL. The data obtained by performing a calculation is stored in
a consistent format, and can be used in the same way regardless of which package
was used to generate it.

<p>In addition to recording properties which were calculated by a particular SCF
engine, the SCF framework also has capabilities for calculating properties which
are derived from the wavefunction, including 3D plots of the electron density
and individual molecular orbitals.


<a name="Panels"></a>
<h2>Single Structure</h2>

<p>The following sections describe the main user interface elements which make
the SCF Wavefunction capabilities available, using the contents of the MOE main
window as the structural template.

<a name="Setup"></a>
<h3>Setup</h3>

<p>A new SCF calculation can be started by selecting the <nobr><b>MOE |
Compute | Simulations | SCF Calculation</b></nobr> menu option.  The
<span class="nobr"><b>SCF Calculation</b></span> panel will be shown.

<p align="center">
<img src="scf/setup1.png" alt="Default MOPAC panel"></p>

This shows that the <tt>MOPAC</tt> engine is selected and that its default
options have not been changed.  The following configuration options are
supported. The availability and choices for these options depend on the
SCF engine:

<p><table border="0" cellpadding="5">

<tr><th align="left" valign="top">Filename</th><td>

If specified, the results of the calculation will be saved in the
Wavefunction file upon completion.  The filename can be specified by
entering it into the text field or by pressing <b>Browse...</b> and
selecting the appropriate file.  The user has the option of creating
a Wavefunction file from the
<span class="nobr"><b>SCF Results</b></span> panel.  Wavefunction files
should have the suffix <tt>.wfn</tt>.<br /><br />

All files for the QM calculation are written in the execution directory.
This is constructed using the name of the Wavefunction as a prefix, combined
with a constant to make it unique.  If the Wavefunction file is omitted,
the calculation uses the value of the <tt>TMP</tt> constant.

</td></tr><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Engine</th><td>

The SCF implementation that will be used for the calculation. While all
engines have significant feature overlap, the sets of parameters and individual
capabilities vary to some extent. Changing the engine will cause some
panel widgets change their sensitivity or selectable options.
User-provided SCF engines will appear when available.
The configure icon, if supported by the SCF engine, provides an easier
means of setting the RC settings required to run the external application.

</td></tr><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Basis&nbsp;Set</th><td>

All SCF engines present a variety of basis sets which affect the
quality and performance of the calculation. this menu contains
Hamiltonians (e.g. the AM1, PM3 and MNDO methods) with the <tt>MOPAC</tt>
engine and atomic orbital basis sets (e.g. STO-3G,  6-31G* etc.) otherwise.
Atomic orbital basis sets can be modified via the <b>Polarization</b>
and/or <b>Diffuse</b> menus if active.

</td></tr><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Polarization</th><td>

Polarization functions, if available, can be used to augment the atomic
orbital basis set and are particularly valuable when hypervalent atoms
are present.  These are denoted by <tt>*</tt> and <tt>**</tt> in the
Pople basis sets (e.g. <span class="nobr">6-31G*</span>).  Other basis
sets will have other designations.

</td></tr><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Diffuse</th><td>

Diffuse functions, if available, can be used to augment the atomic
orbital basis set and are particularly valuable when anions or "soft"
atoms are present.  These are denoted by <tt>+</tt> and <tt>++</tt>
in the Pople basis sets (e.g. <span class="nobr">6-31+G</span>).  Other
basis sets will have other designations.

</td></tr><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Multiplicity</th><td>

Specifies the number of unpaired electrons, and whether the calculation is
performed as a closed shell, open shell or excited state system. Multiplicity is
defined as <i>2S+1</i> where <i>S</i> is the spin of the system, and each
electron has a spin of &frac12;. Common multiplicity values are: 1 = closed
shell system, 2 = radical ground state, 3 = biradical or first excited state of
an ordinarily closed-shell system, etc. Closed shell calculations are usually
done with an RHF (Restricted Hartree-Fock) treatment, open shell calculations
with UHF (Unrestricted Hartree-Fock).

</td></tr><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Method</th><td>

The computational method that will be used for the calculation.  These
include Semi-Empirical, Hartree-Fock, Density Functional Theory and/or
post-Hartree-Fock options.  Each SCF engine provides a range of methods
of varying cost and complexity.

</td></tr><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Geometry Optimization</th><td>

If off, the calculation will be done as a stationary point, i.e. it is
assumed that the input coordinates are already suitable for calculating the
wavefunction and any derived properties. If on, the engine will be
instructed to iterate using the default gradient/optimization techniques to find
the lowest energy structure, and the resulting coordinates, wavefunction and
properties will be based on this result.

</td></tr><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Keep&nbsp;QM&nbsp;Files</th><td>

If on, the input and output files from the SCF calculation will be retained.
These will be saved in the execution directory whose name is drawn from the
Wavefunction file (if specified) or in the directory specified by the
<tt>TMP</tt> constant.

</td></tr><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Vibrational Frequencies</th><td>

If on and supported by the SCF engine, vibrational frequencies and their
normal modes will be calculated.  This yields IR spectra in the
<span class="nobr"><b>SCF Results</b></span> panel and can be used to 
evaluate whether the geometry optimization has successfully converged.

</td></tr><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Circular Dichroism</th><td>

If on and supported by the SCF engine, the circular dichroism profile will be
calculated, which has opposite sign for opposite enantiomers.

</td></tr><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Solvent&nbsp;Model</th><td>

Many computational engines support one or more types of solvent models in
order to mimic the effect of being in solution. When available, the solvent
model may be selected from a list, and the dielectric (&epsilon;) and
solute radius may be tweaked as necessary.

<a name="MultiStep">
</td></tr><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Multi-step Convergence</th><td>

If on, a multi-step calculation is performed to increase the likelihood of
successful geometry optimization:

<ol>
<li>Run the optimization as specied by the user.<br /><br />
<li>If (1) is unsuccessful, the results are discarded.  The optimization
is retried with the force constant matrix calculated at the start and
again after every 10 optimization cycles.<br /><br />
<li>If (2) is unsuccessful, the results are discarded.  The optimization
is retried with the force constant matrix calculated at each optimization cycle.
</ol>

The user is informed if (3) fails.  The initial geometry and SCF engine
options should be reviewed before repeating the calculation.
This is supported for the <tt>Gaussian</tt> engine only.

</td></tr><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Linear&nbsp;Scaling</th><td>

If on and supported by the SCF engine, linear scaling methods will be
used.  This makes large-scale calculations possible in reasonable
amounts of time and can result in some loss of precision.

</td></tr><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Fixed&nbsp;Atoms</th><td>

If on and supported by the SCF engine, the fixed/unfixed state of the
atoms in MOE will be used during the calculation.

</td></tr><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Electronic Excitations</th><td>

If on and supported by the SCF engine, the energies and intensities of
electronic excitation transitions will be calculated. This can be time
consuming. Typically, only excitations involving frontier orbitals are
calculated.

</td></tr><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Job&nbsp;Title</th><td>

An arbitrary title can be given to the calculation. This text will be shown in
the
<span class="nobr"><b>SCF Results</b></span> panel, as well as written to
the input or output files where appropriate.

</td></tr><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Keywords</th><td>

If supported by the SCF engine, additional
configuration keywords can be provided by entering them (space separated)
in this text box. The manner in which they are interpreted is
entirely dependent on the engine. All engines are designed such that the
parameters which can be selected in the <b>Setup Panel</b> are generally
sufficient for routine calculations.

<br /><br />
A keyword example, for the <tt>MOPAC</tt> engine, would be
<tt>T=600</tt>, which would ensure that the calculation did not take
longer than 5 minutes.  The <tt>Gaussian</tt> engine also supports the
<tt>method=<i>method</i></tt> and <tt>basis=<i>basis</i></tt> keywords.
These allow the user to specify a method or basis set not contained
in the option menus described above.

</td></tr><tr><th align="left"
valign="top">Selected&nbsp;Atoms&nbsp;Only</th><td>

If on, all atoms of the connected component(s) containing selected atoms
will be used in the calculation.

</td></tr><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Verbose&nbsp;Output</th><td>

If on, additional information is written to the SVL Commands window as
the calculation proceeds.

</td></tr><tr><th align="left" valign="top">
View&nbsp;QM&nbsp;Input&nbsp;File</th><td>

Pressing <b>View&nbsp;QM&nbsp;Input&nbsp;File</b> opens a text editor
that contains the input file that will be submitted to the SCF engine
(no calculation is performed).  Note that modifications made to this file
will <i>not</i> be used.

</td></tr><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Save&nbsp;Settings</th><td>

Pressing <b>Save Settings</b> saves the current settings of the
<span class="nobr"><b>SCF Calculation</b></span> panel as the new defaults.
These defaults are also used by the 
<a href="emin.htm">
<span class="nobr"><b>Energy Minimization</b></span></a> and
<a href="confsrch.htm">
<span class="nobr"><b>Conformational Search</b></span></a> applications.

</td></tr><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Standard&nbsp;Settings</th><td>

Pressing <b>Standard Settings</b> restores the settings of the
<span class="nobr"><b>SCF Calculation</b></span> panel to the original
default values for the current SCF engine.
These defaults are also used by the
<span class="nobr"><b>Energy Minimization</b></span> and
<span class="nobr"><b>Conformational Search</b></span> applications.

</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
To start the calculation, press the <b>Run</b> button. The panel will close,
and a status indication will be shown in the MOE Window. The level of
detail of the progress report depends on the engine.  If a Wavefunction
file has been specified in the <b>Filename</b> field, and
a file of that name already exists, a prompt requesting confirmation
for overwrite will appear.

<p>
If the calculation is a new one, it will use the atoms from the MOE main
window as the molecular structure starting point. If the calculation is being
continued, the already-extant molecular structure will be used, with atomic
coordinates as-determined at the end of the previous calculation.

<p>
Pressing the <b>Load</b> button instructs the SCF framework to try and
process the output file(s) from the current SCF engine.  It brings up a
file browser and the user can select the appropriate output file.
If, for example, the <tt>Gaussian</tt> engine is used and the files
are contained in <tt>/tmp/gaussian_run</tt>, clicking on
<tt>/tmp/gaussian_run/gaussian.out</tt> will process the output and
formatted checkpoint file (<tt>gaussian.fchk</tt>).  Successful processing
is based on the versions of MOE and the SCF engine involved.

<a name="Results"></a>
<h3>Results</h3>

<p>Once a calculation is complete, the
<span class="nobr"><b>SCF Results</b></span> panel will be shown.
Alternatively, an existing Wavefunction file can be opened using
<span class="nobr"><b>MOE | File | Open</b></span>,
which will also lead to this panel being shown:

<p><div align="center"><img src="scf/results.png"></div>

<p>The
<span class="nobr"><b>SCF Results</b></span> panel is a multi-page panel.
The page is controlled by the
option list at the top of the panel, which defaults to <b>Results</b>. Other
pages which are available include <b>Atoms</b>, <b>Spectra</b>,
<b>Eigenvalues</b>, <b>Transitions</b> and <b>Notes</b>.

<p>The most prominent information summarizing the calculation is displayed on
the <b>Results</b> page:

<p><table border="0" cellpadding="5">

<tr><th align="left" valign="top">Summary</th><td>

The top left section of the page shows a 2D chemical diagram representation
of the structure, and various other statistics including filename, engine, basis
set, chemical formula, number of atoms, overall charge, number of atomic
orbitals, number of electrons involved in the calculation, the total SCF
energy (in Hartrees), the dipole moment (in Debye), the heat of formation
(in kcal/mol, if available), the solvent model used and the number of
negative vibrational frequencies (if available).

</td></tr><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Molecular&nbsp;Orbitals</th><td>

The right hand side of the page is taken up by a graphical representation of
the molecular orbital energy levels (eigenvalues). The levels are arranged in a
form similar to that displayed in many textbooks, and attempt to capture the
relative scale of the frontier orbitals, and show any degeneracies. Each
orbital is marked with the number of electrons with which it is filled. The
selected orbitals (HOMO and LUMO by default) are highlighted, and the energy gap
between them is shown.

</td></tr><tr><th align="left" valign="top">
<img src="scf/mobutt1.png" alt="Zoom in & Zoom out"></th><td>

Using the Zoom In and Zoom out buttons, the zoom level of the molecular orbital
display can be adjusted.

</td></tr><tr><th align="left" valign="top">
<img src="scf/mobutt2.png" alt="Up & Down"></th><td>

Using the Up and Down buttons, the zero-energy position of the molecular orbital
display can be moved.

</td></tr><tr><th align="left" valign="top">To, From</th><td>

At any given time there are two orbital selections. The initial default
selection is <b>From</b> = HOMO and <b>To</b> = LUMO.
Unless they are changed to the same
orbital, a red arrow is drawn onto the main graphic to illustrate the
transition.

</td></tr><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Energy</th><td>

The energy values of the two selected molecular orbitals are shown
(<b>E(high)</b> and <b>E(low)</b>, respectively).
By default the energies are given in <tt>au</tt> (atomic
units, also known as Hartrees). Note the unit selection radio button to the
right; the energies can also be shown in <tt>eV</tt> (electron volts). Note that
<tt>nm</tt> (nanometers) is only appropriate for energy transitions, and so is
not used for the individual energy levels.

</td></tr><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Delta&nbsp;E</th><td>

If the <b>To</b> and <b>From</b> selections are not the same, the
energy difference between
them is shown using the selected units, be they <tt>au</tt>, <tt>eV</tt> or
<tt>nm</tt>. Note that <tt>nm</tt> (nanometers) is a reciprocal unit and is
proportional to the inverse of the energy difference.

</td></tr><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Plot&nbsp;Style</th><td>

The manner in which plots are displayed is controlled by this option menu,
which consists of the following:

<ul>

<li><tt>Solid Surface</tt> (default): Plots are represented as a solid shell
with a fully reflective surface.

<li><tt>Transparent Surface</tt>: Partial transparency is used in order to allow
viewing of superimposed portions.

<li><tt>Wireframe Surface</tt>: The surface of the plot is represented with
lines, which allow interior portions to be seen as well.

<li><tt>Point Grid</tt>: Each point within the grid is plotted as a small dot.

</ul>

</td></tr><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Plot&nbsp;Orbitals</th><td>

Plots at least one molecular orbital. The orbitals which are plotted are all
those which lie within the range From .. To (inclusive). In order for the
orbital plots to be meaningful, the molecular system must be created within the
MOE Window, which is done automatically, prompting for permission if
necessary. The calculation required to generate each molecular orbital as a 3D
grid is moderately time-consuming, and so a progress indicator is provided.
Display of the orbitals can be changed using the Graphics Object Manager.

</td></tr><tr><th align="left"
valign="top">Plot&nbsp;Electron&nbsp;Density</th><td>

Plots the electron density of the molecule, which is derived from the total
of the occupied orbitals. Electron density grids take longer to calculate
than do individual molecular orbitals.

</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Two examples of graphical plots are shown below. For both types, the shapes
are plotted to encapsulate approximately 80% of the integral of the evaluated
grid points. The spacing of the grid points depends on the dimensions of the
molecular species, and is automatically adjusted to trade-off between quality
and time. The plot style shown is <tt>Solid Surface</tt>.

<p><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="20">
<tr>
<th><img src="scf/plot1.jpg"></th>
<th><img src="scf/plot2.jpg"></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital</td>
<th>Electron Density</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>In many cases, it is useful to plot frontier molecular orbitals using the
<tt>Transparent&nbsp;Surface</tt> mode, which more readily facilitates
visualization of the nodal lobes:

<p><div align="center"><img src="scf/plot3.png"></div>

<p>Other pages in the Results panel are specific to particular data categories:

<p><table border="0" cellpadding="5">

<tr><th align="left" valign="top">Atoms</th><td>

Each of the atoms involved in the calculation is displayed, with its index,
element symbol, atomic number, coordinates and partial charge (if available).
The coordinates are given in atomic units (Bohr), not angstroms.
Also, for convenience, the 2D diagram is shown,
alongside a redrawn version which shows the atomic indexes of each atom.

<tr><th align="left" valign="top">Spectra</th><td>

If IR or UV-vis spectra are generated by the calculation, they are
displayed here.  Individual spectra are displayed by clicking on the
appropriate value of the <b>Spectrum Type</b> radio button.

</td></tr><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Eigenvalues</th><td>

Each of the eigenvalues resulting from the calculation is shown, with its
index, energy in atomic units (Hartrees), occupancy (number of electrons
attributed to it), label, and energy difference from the appropriate frontier
orbitals. Energy differences for occupied orbitals are calculated relative to
the HOMO, unoccupied orbitals relative to the LUMO.

</td></tr><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Transitions</th><td>

Shows a selected subset of the transitions between molecular orbitals, along
with the from/to orbital, occupancy, energy difference and relative
transition intensities.

</td></tr><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Notes</th><td>

Textual input relevant to the underlying engine and any unusual conditions is
shown on this page, which is divided into three sections: Input, Output and
Errors.

<p>
The typical input for the external SCF engines is a single text file with
coordinate and control information.  As this is usually small, the entire
input file is shown in the Input box.  This provides a means of checking
the specific information passed to the SCF engine.

<p>Similarly, the Output box contains a portion of the text generated by such
an external application, though it is generally edited for brevity since such
documents can be large.

<p>The Errors box shows any problems which were explicitly recognized by the
engine.

</td></tr>
</table>

The Results panel has the following command buttons:

<p><table border="0" cellpadding="5">

<tr><th align="left" valign="top">Recompute</th><td>

It is possible and useful to chain together calculations, by restarting a new
calculation using the molecular system and optimized geometry resulting from a
previous calculation. For example, it may be desirable to perform a preliminary
geometry determination using a <tt>MOPAC</tt> semi-empirical Hamiltonian,
followed by a refinement using an ab initio method. The Recompute button brings
up the SCF Setup panel, which is pre-filled with the parameters of the current
system.

</td></tr><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Realize</th><td>

Viewing the geometry resulting from a calculation is most conveniently done
by creating the molecular system in the MOE Window. The Realize feature
does this. If MOE already contains the atom keys (which is usually the case when
a calculation has been run during the same session), only the coordinates are
updated. Otherwise a dialog box is shown which requests whether to clear various
data in order to make way for the new atoms. Note that plotting orbitals and
electron density are preceded by an implied Realize.

</td></tr><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Load...</th><td>

An alternative Wavefunction file may be loaded into the current panel.

</td></tr><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Save As...</th><td>

The wavefunction data may be saved to the specified file. Note that if the
Results page indicates that there is a known filename, it is correct to assume
that the file has been saved. Since the
<span class="nobr"><b>SCF Results</b></span> panel is read-only, and the
calculation features save their results at any important checkpoint, the only 
circumstance in which the data is transient is when no filename has been
provided. If this is the case, the data will be lost after closing all the
panels which retain a copy of it.

</td></tr><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Print</th><td>

This button brings up the <b>Print Wavefunction</b> panel, which is described
below.

</td></tr>
</table>

<a name="Print"></a>
<h3>Print</h3>

<p>Wavefunction data can be formatted for printing, and is presented in the
standard MOE print preview panel:

<p><div align="center"><img src="scf/print.png"></div>

<p>A variety of checkboxes control the content, each of which will cause the
corresponding data to be arranged on however many pages are deemed necessary:

<p><table border="0" cellpadding="5">

<tr><th align="left" valign="top">Header&nbsp;Page</th><td>

Standard information about the molecule and the calculation is presented,
which is the same as the summary shown in the
<span class="nobr"><b>SCF Results</b> panel.

</td></tr><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Molecular&nbsp;Orbitals</th><td>

The schematic diagram of the molecular orbital energy levels is drawn below
the summary.

</td></tr><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Atom&nbsp;Positions</th><td>

A schematic of the atom numbering scheme corresponding to the chemical
diagram is shown, followed by a table of each of the atoms and their Cartesian
coordinates. Note that the coordinates are given in atomic units (Bohr), not
angstroms.

</td></tr><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Basis&nbsp;Functions</th><td>

The data which comprise the basis functions are displayed. The basis
functions combined with the eigenvalues make up the wavefunction description of
the molecule. Wavefunctions in MOE can be composed of either of two
different varieties of basis functions: Slater orbitals or Gaussian orbitals.
The former are typically favored by semi-empirical methods, the latter by ab
initio methods.

<br /><br />
Regardless of type, each basis function has an index, an associated atom, and
a center position (usually that of the associated atom). Both types have
momentum terms for each Cartesian coordinate (MX, MY, MZ), which are zero for
spherical orbitals and non-zero for the degenerate orbitals. Slater functions
have an additional radial term (MR). 

<br /><br />
Slater functions complete their description with the pre-exponential constant
(zeta) and post-exponential constant (N). Gaussian functions are further divided
into some number of contractions (usually 6 or less), each of which has a
pre-exponential coefficient (Exp#) and a post-exponential constant (Coef#).

</td></tr><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Eigenvalues</th><td>

The individual eigenvalues (molecular orbital energy levels) are displayed in
columns.

</td></tr><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Eigenvectors</th><td>

The list of eigenvectors is displayed as a square matrix, split over as many
pages as necessary. The atomic orbitals are shown by columns, and the molecular
orbitals by rows.

</td></tr><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Density&nbsp;Matrix</th><td>

The density matrix, which is the iterative variable during the SCF iteration
and the precursor to the wavefunction, is displayed as a square matrix. 

</td></tr><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Overlap&nbsp;Matrix</th><td>

The atomic orbital overlap matrix is displayed as a square matrix, if
available. Not all computational engines make this information available.

</td></tr><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Vibrational&nbsp;Frequencies</th><td>

If available, numerical tables showing the calculated vibrational frequencies
are shown.

</td></tr><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Font&nbsp;Size</th><td>

The base font size can be adjusted, which is useful for affecting the number
of pages used by the entire output.

</td></tr>
</table>

the summary.

<a name="Configuration"></a>
<h2>Configuration</h2>

<p>Several SCF engines are included with MOE, each of which provides an
interface to an external package. Specific configuration, as described below,
may be required in order to run these applications.

<p>It is still possible to review data which has been calculated using one of
these engines, even if the application itself is not available on the current
workstation.

<a name="MOPAC"></a>
<h3>MOPAC Engine</h3>

<p>The <tt>MOPAC</tt> application is included with MOE, and is generally
fully functional without any special configuration steps. The SCF framework
interface is an additional layer based on preexisting SVL functions. See <a

information.

<h3>MOPAC2007/2009 Engine</h3>

<p><tt>MOPAC2007</tt> is a modern version of MOPAC 7, which is not public domain
and is not provided as part of the MOE package. It may be obtained from <a
href="http://openmopac.net">Stewart Computational Chemistry</a>. 
</p>

<p>When using the <tt>MOPAC2007</tt> engine rather than the default available
<tt>MOPAC</tt> engine, the most important differences are:

<ul>

<li>PM6 and RM1 Hamiltonians

<li>No 60 heavy atom limit

<li>Drastically improved convergence

<li>Operational COSMO solvent model

</ul>

<p>
<tt>MOPAC2009</tt> is <tt>MOPAC2007</tt> plus the MOZYME function.
The most important
improvements from <tt>MOPAC2007</tt> are:

<ul>

<li>Giant molecule capability

<li>Drastically improved convergence

<li>New PM6 parameterization including a wider range of elements

</ul>

<p><span class="tip">Tip</span> <tt>MOPAC2009</tt> is configured identically
to <tt>MOPAC2007</tt>.  The RC variables referring to <tt>mopac2007</tt>
are used for <tt>MOPAC2009</tt> as well.
</p>

<p><tt>MOPAC2007/2009</tt> is largely keyword-compatible with the earlier
version, so most optional keywords function in the same way. The output of the
newer engine is also very similar, but in addition it provides for a structured
output format, which can be more reliably parsed by software, and is used by the
MOE wrapper functions.

<p>Because <tt>MOPAC2007/2009</tt> is not a default part of MOE,
it is necessary to
specify the location of the executable program, which must be installed
separately. The executable location is stored in the RC file, and can be
configured using the <tt>SetRC</tt> command, e.g.:

<pre>    SetRC ['mopac2007.exe', '/opt/mopac/mopac.exe']</pre>

<p>Some editions of <tt>MOPAC2007/2009</tt> require a license file in
order to run.
The recommended way to ensure that this file is available is to set the
corresponding value in the RC file to the directory (no
trailing '<tt>/</tt>') in which the license
file is found, e.g.:

<pre>    SetRC ['mopac2007.license', '/opt/mopac']</pre>

<p>If the system environment variable <tt>MOPAC_LICENSE</tt> is set before MOE
is run, then this step is optional. Similarly it may not be necessary to specify
the location of the license file if the current working directory is the
location of the <tt>MOPAC2007/2009</tt> executable.

<h3>ADF Engine</h3>

<p>The <tt>ADF</tt> (Amsterdam Density Functional) program is not provided as
part of the MOE distribution. It may be obtained by license from <a
href="http://www.scm.com">Scientific Computing &amp; Modelling</a>, and has been
ported to most modern platforms.

<p>The SCF interface to <tt>ADF</tt> uses several configuration settings
in order to run the executable files.  They can be specified by clicking
on the configure icon of <b>Engine:</b> when the ADF engine is used:

<p align="center">
<img src="scf/ADFRC.png" alt="ADF setup panel"></p>

<p>Only the first of these entries is mandatory for a conventional installation
of <tt>ADF</tt>.  The
<span class="nobr"><b>bin Directory</b></span> and
<span class="nobr"><b>Atomic Data</b><span> directory are optional, as they
can be derived from the
<span class="nobr"><b>ADF Directory</b></span>
and the number of <b>Threads</b> defaults to 1.

<p>Additional information is available in the
<span class="nobr">
<a href="../moe/extprog.htm#ADF">Interfacing to External Programs</a>
</span>
section of the manual.

<a name="GAMESS"></a>
<h3>GAMESS Engine</h3>

<p>The <tt>GAMESS</tt> (General Atomic and Molecular Electronic Structure
System) program is not provided as part of the MOE distribution. It must first
be obtained by requesting permission from <a
href="http://www.msg.chem.iastate.edu/gamess">Iowa State University</a>,
then compiled and installed on the appropriate workstation.

<p>The SCF interface to <tt>GAMESS</tt> uses several configuration settings
in order to run the executable files.  They can be specified by clicking
on the configure icon of <b>Engine:</b> when the GAMESS engine is used:

<p align="center">
<img src="scf/GAMESSRC.png" alt="GAMESS setup panel"></p>

<p>Only the first of these entries is mandatory for a conventional
installation of <tt>GAMESS</tt>.  The location of <b>ddikick</b>,
<b>ericfmt</b>, the <span class="nobr"><b>Restart Dir</b></span</b>
and the <b>Version</b> are optional as they can be derived from the
<b>Executable</b> path and the value of the <tt>TMP</tt> constant.

<p>During the execution of the <tt>GAMESS</tt> application, the SCF engine sets
up a large number of environment variables to instruct <tt>GAMESS</tt> as to
where to find its input, output and temporary storage data. These are
constructed based on the value of the <tt>TMP</tt> constant and are written
in the execution directory.

<p>Additional information is available in the
<span class="nobr">
<a href="../moe/extprog.htm#GAMESS">Interfacing to External Programs</a>
</span>
section of the manual.

<a name="Gaussian"></a>
<h3>Gaussian Engine</h3>

<p>The <tt>Gaussian</tt> program is not provided as part of the MOE
distribution.  It may be obtained by license from
<a href="http://www.gaussian.com">Gaussian, Inc</a>, and has been ported to
most modern platforms.

<p>The SCF interface to <tt>Gaussian</tt> uses a single configuration
setting to identify the <tt>g09</tt> executable.  All other information
is derived from this setting:
