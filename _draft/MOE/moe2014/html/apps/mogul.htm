<h2>Introduction</h2>

<a href="http://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/SupportandResources/Support/Documentation/pages/Documentation.aspx" target="_blank">Mogul</a>
from the <a href="http://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre</a>
provides precise information on preferred molecular
geometries using millions of chemically classified bond lengths,
angles and acyclic torsion angles derived from the
Cambridge Structural Database.  Mogul includes a graphical user interface
that allows users to load and analyze individual structures:

<p align="center">
<img src="mogul/biotinmogul.png" alt="Biotin in Mogul" /></p>

The results are presented as a histogram, and full descriptive statistics
are included.  Users can also review the individual fragments drawn from
the Mogul database (containing the specific geometric parameter) used to
construct the histogram.

<p>
Mogul can also be run in the background via instruction files written in a
simple text-based
command language.  This allows Mogul to be integrated into MOE in several
ways: (a) Mogul Analysis, an application allowing users to interactively
review, modify and monitor all or part of their structure (described below),
(b) the
<a href="../moe/gui/mainwin.htm#DihedralProfile">Dihedral Profile</a>
display has been modified to show the Mogul
histogram data if available and (c) as a
<a href="../install/web_inst.htm">MOE/web</a> SOAP service that provides
easy access to a remote Mogul server.


<!-- ============================ RUNNING ================================ !-->

<p>
<a name="Panel"></a>
<h2>Running Mogul Analysis</h2>

To use the Mogul Analysis application, load a structure into the main MOE
window and select
<span class="menu">MOE | Compute | Conformations | Mogul Analysis</span>
to start the application:

<p align="center">
<img src="mogul/mogulpanel.png" alt="Mogul Analysis Panel" /></p>

This panel is divided into two parts: the top contains information on the
composition, value and quality metric for each of the desired geometric
features. The bottom displays a histogram of the structural information
provided by Mogul.   This display is dynamic, reflecting the
current values of the geometric features and is cleared when the topological
changes are made.

<table cellpadding="5">
<tr>
<td valign="top">
<b>Info</b>
<td valign="top">
Indicates whether the value of the geometric feature is sufficiently different
from the
tabulated data (unusual) or whether there is limited or no information
about the feature in Mogul's database (insufficient).  Unusual features
are indicated by a <b>u</b> and features with insufficient information
are indicated by an <b>i</b>.

<tr>
<td valign="top">
<b>Atom1&nbsp-<br />Atom4</b>
<td valign="top">
The atoms making up the specific geometric feature:
<span class="nobr"><tt>Atom1-Atom2</tt></span> for
a bond length, etc.  If the atoms have a name, it is provided in
parentheses.

<tr>
<td valign="top">
<b>Value</b>
<td valign="top">
The value of the specific geometric feature, angstroms for bond lengths
and degrees for bond angles and torsions.

<tr>
<td valign="top">
<b>Metric</b>
<td valign="top">
The value of the quality metric used by Mogul to determine whether the
specific geometric feature is unusual.  For bond length and angles
the Z-Score is used while for torsions the local density,
defined as the percentage of observed values within 10&deg;, is used.

<tr>
<td valign="top">
<b>Type</b>
<td valign="top">
The type of each geometric feature: <b>torsion</b>, <b>bond</b> or
<b>angle</b>.

<tr>
<td valign="top">
<b>Current Value</b>
<td valign="top">
The value of the currently selected geometric feature.  To modify, enter
a new value and press return.  Bond angles are restricted to [0,&nbsp;180]
degrees and torsions to [-180,&nbsp;180] degrees.  Changing the value might
change other geometric features related by shared atoms.

<tr>
<td valign="top">
<b>Reverse</b>
<td valign="top">
By default, changing the Current Value moves the rightmost atom
(<tt>Atom2</tt> of <span class="nobr"><tt>Atom1-Atom2</tt></span>, etc).
Pressing <b>Reverse</b> causes the leftmost atom (<tt>Atom1</tt> of
<span class="nobr"><tt>Atom1-Atom2</tt></span>) to move instead.
The first atom of the moving side, <tt>Atom1</tt>,
will be rendered with a starry
halo.  The button turns <font color="red">red</font> as a reminder.
Press the <b>?</b> button to the right to briefly highlight (in the
MOE window) the moving atom.

<tr>
<td valign="top">
<b>Settings</b>
<td valign="top">
The Mogul Analysis Settings panel can be used to specify how to find the
Mogul executable and whether Mogul should ignore geometric information
from organometallic or solvent molecules.  The panel is described
<a href="#Settings">below</a>.

<tr>
<td valign="top">
<b>Histogram Plot</b>
<td valign="top">
The plot shows a histogram of the structural information provided by Mogul
for the currently-selected geometric feature.  The X-axis is the range
of values in angstroms or degrees.  The Y-axis is the number of entries
returned by Mogul.  The current value is displayed as a line on the histogram,
<font color="red">red</font> if unusual and <font color="green">green</font>
otherwise.  This value can be changed by picking
in the plot or changing the Current Value field.  The setting of the
Reverse button specifies which end of the molecule will move.
Changing the value might
change other geometric features related by shared atoms.

<tr>
<td valign="top">
<b>Run</b>
<td valign="top">
Select two or more adjacent heavy atoms and press <b>Run</b> to analyze
the current structure using Mogul.

<tr>
<td valign="top">
<b>Reset</b>
<td valign="top">
Pressing <b>Reset</b> restores the geometry and selection state of the
current structures to that of the last Mogul calculation (when Run
was pressed).

<tr>
<td valign="top">
<b>Open in Mogul</b>
<td valign="top">
This button is active if a local copy of Mogul is available.  Pressing
<span class="nobr"><b>Open in Mogul</b></span> opens Mogul to display the
current structure and the currently selected geometric feature.  This
can be used for detailed investigation of individual parameters using the
structural information found by Mogul.

</td></tr>
</table>

After selecting the appropriate atoms, press <b>Run</b> to start the
Mogul analysis.  A message appears in the main MOE window while Mogul
is running.  Upon completion, the structural information is read and
the Mogul Analysis panel is updated:

<p align="center">
<img src="mogul/mogulpanel2.png" alt="Updated Mogul Analysis Panel" /></p>

In this case, the <tt>C(1)-C(2)</tt> bond length is unusual (marked with a
<b>u</b>), with a Metric (Z-score) greater than 2.0.  Picking a geometric
feature loads the histogram plot with the data from Mogul.  If the
feature is not in a ring, the first atom of the moving side will be 
rendered with a starry halo.  This is
demonstrated <a href="#Analyze">below</a>.


<!-- ============================ CONFIG PANEL =========================== !-->

<p>
<a name="Settings"></a>
<h2>Mogul Analysis Settings</h2>

Selecting the <b>Settings</b> icon in the Mogul Analysis application brings
up the settings panel:

<p align="center">
<img src="mogul/mogulsettings.png" alt="Updated Mogul Analysis Panel" /></p>

<table cellpadding="5">
<tr>
<td valign="top">
<b>Executable</b>
<td valign="top">
This specifies the full or relative path of the Mogul executable or the
URL of the MOE/web Mogul SOAP service.  It is sufficient to specify the
URL of MOE/web.  Press <b>Browse</b> to select the filename of
the Mogul executable.  Consult the Mogul User's Guide
for the name of the Mogul executable for your specific operating system.
This sets the name of the <tt>mogul.exe</tt> RC variable for later use such
as in Dihedral Profile.

<tr>
<td valign="top">
<b>Exclude organometallics</b>
<td valign="top">
If on,  Mogul will
ignore any fragments in the Mogul database that contain a transition metal,
lanthanide, actinide or any of Al, Ga, In, Tl, Ge, Sn, Pb, Sb, Bi, Po while
performing a search.

<tr>
<td valign="top">
<b>Exclude solvent</b>
<td valign="top">
If on, Mogul will ignore any fragments in the Mogul database that come from
structures in the CCDC catalog of known solvents while performing a search.
If a crystal structure contains only solvent molecules then the largest
molecule will be assumed to be a non-solvent.

</td></tr>
</table>

All changes are also recorded in the MOE configuration file and take effect
the next time Mogul Analysis is used.


<!-- =============================== EXAMPLE ============================= -->

<a name="Examples"></a>
<h2>Examples</h2>

In this section, we will present a number of example calculations using
Mogul.  The input file, used in both examples,  is available
in <span class="nobr"><tt>$MOE/sample/mol</tt></span>.

<div class="example">

<a name="Analyze">
<h3>Analyze a Structure</h3>
<ol start="1">
<li>
Clear the system:
<p class="indent_novspace">
<span class="menu">MOE | File | Close</span></p><br />

<li>
Load a structure into MOE:
<p class="indent_novspace">
<span class="menu">RHS | Open</span></p>
In the Open panel, select
<span class="nobr"><tt>$MOE/sample/mol/biotin.moe</tt></span>.<br /><br />

<li>
Start <b>Mogul Analysis</b>:
<p class="indent_novspace">
<span class="menu">MOE | Compute | Conformations | Mogul Analysis</span>
</p><br />

<li>
<i>Select a portion of the molecule</i><br>
Orient the molecules as shown below.<br />
Select the atoms of the tail.<br />

<p align="center">
<img src="mogul/biotinpix.png" alt="Biotin Selected Subset" /></p>

</ol>
Press <b>Run</b> to analyze the selected subset with Mogul.  A message
appears in the MOE window while Mogul is running.  When completed, the
Mogul Analysis panel will be updated:

<p align="center">
<img src="mogul/biotinresults1.png" alt="Biotin Subset Results 1" /></p>

The panel contains the Mogul information for all geometric features contained
in the selected subset: 4 torsions, 6 bonds and 6 angles.  Selecting the
first torsion
<span class="nobr"><tt>C(C9)-C(C10)-C(C11)-O(O11)</tt></span> displays
the histogram from Mogul:

<p align="center">
<img src="mogul/biotinresults2.png" alt="Biotin Subset Results 2" /></p>

The atom selection in the MOE window has been changed to reflect the
specific torsion.  The Current Value is shown as a red line in the
histogram.  If a local installation of Mogul is available,
<span class="nobr"><b>Open in Mogul</b></span> can be pressed to bring up
the specific torsion in the Mogul GUI:

<p align="center">
<img src="mogul/biotinmogul.png" alt="Biotin in Mogul" /></p>

This allows the user to explore the fragments and other information used
by Mogul to create the histogram.

<p>
As mentioned previously, the histogram in in the Mogul Analysis panel is
dynamic; changes to the geometry of the system are reflected by changes
to the appropriate geometric parameters.  The value of the currently
selected torsion angle can be changed by entering a different value
in the Current Value field and hitting return or by picking elsewhere
on the histogram plot.

<p>
For example, the value of this dihedral can be changed by picking on the
histogram in the low-valued histogram bar at roughly -155 degrees.  The
line on the histogram and the Current Value are changed to reflect the
new value and the geometry of the carboxylate group is adjusted.  The line
becomes green because there is sufficient information in the adjacent bins:

<p align="center">
<img src="mogul/adjust1.png" alt="Adjusted Biotin Results 1" /></p>

Note that the value for 
<span class="nobr"><tt>C(C9)-C(C10)-C(C11)-O(O12)</tt></span>, which
shares the same rotatable bond, has changed to roughly 25&deg;.  
By default, changing the dihedral moves the oxygen atoms (Atom4).
If Reverse is pressed, the ring and unselected chain atoms
will move.  <tt>Atom1</tt> will be rendered with a starry halo to indicate
the root of the moving portion.
Picking on the histogram will keep the position of the
carboxylate group constant and move the rest of the structures.
Alternatively, pressing <span class="menu">RHS | Minimize</span>
will relax the current structure, simultaneously changing all of the
parameters as the calculation progresses.  If a strained geometry
results, some of the geometric parameters might be marked unusual.

<div class="example">

<a name="Dihedral">
<h3>Annotated Dihedral Profile</h3>
<ol start="1">
<li>
<div class="floatright">
<img src="mogul/biotinbond1b.png" alt="Biotin Dihedral 1" /></p>
</div>

Clear the system:
<p class="indent_novspace">
<span class="menu">MOE | File | Close</span></p><br />

<li>
Load a structure into MOE:
<p class="indent_novspace">
<span class="menu">RHS | Open</span></p>
In the Open panel, select
<span class="nobr"><tt>$MOE/sample/mol/biotin.moe</tt></span>.<br /><br />

<li>
<i>Pick the desired bond</i><br />
Orient biotin to expose the side chain<br />
Pick the central C-C bond:<br /><br />

<li>
Calculate the energy profile:
<p class="indent_novspace">
<span class="menu">Footer | <img src="mogul/plot.png" style="vertical-align:middle;"/></span></p>
</ol>

The energy profile appears in a popup.  If Mogul is available, as either a
local executable or a SOAP service, the dihedrals spanning the selected bond
are analyzed and their resulting histograms are combined and added to the
energy profile.  In this case there are thousands of fragments in the
Mogul database for this geometric parameter so the histogram counts are
scaled to the [0,&nbsp;10] scale used for strain energy.  Notice that there is
excellent correspondence between the energy curve and the histogram data:

<p align="center">
<img src="mogul/biotinbond2.png" alt="Biotin Dihedral 1" /></p>

Note that the energy minima correspond, for the most part, to the histogram
maxima.  The crystal structures tend to occur in lower-energy conformations.
The asymmetry of the energy curve is due to more distant steric interactions
of this particular structure.
