<p>
The Combinatorial Builder enumerates a virtual library of all possible
products that are combinatorially generated from a core scaffold and a set of
monodentate R-group databases.  The user indicates the atom(s) to be used as
<i>attachment points</i> and associates an R-group library with each (or
accepts the default).  For substituents with multiple connections,
<a href="../apps/scaffold.htm">Scaffold Replacement</a> or
<a href="../apps/combitools.htm">Combinatorial Library</a> should
be used.  If a receptor is available, Forcefield Refinement can be used
to generate bound poses along with various docking scores.


<!-- ============================= METHODOLOGY -=========================== -->

<p>
<a name="Method"></a>
<h2>Methodology</h2>

<p>
The Combinatorial Builder application performs a series of operations on
behalf of the user, as indicated in the following flowchart.  Each will
be described in detail in following sections.

<p align="center">
<img src="frag_combi/combiflow.png" alt="Combinatorial Builder Flowchart" /></p>

<p>
The starting point for the Combinatorial Builder is a ligand that will be
used as the scaffold.  If a receptor is present, the scaffold is assumed to
be in the cleft and pocket atoms are used to constrain molecular construction.
In such cases, Forcefield Refinement and Scoring can be used to evaluate
protein/ligand poses.

<h3>Generate Rotamers</h3>
<p>
Attachment points define the sites where R-groups from the user-specified (or
default) libraries are connected to the scaffold.  Thus, they define an axis
about which low-energy, rigid-body rotamers of each R-group can be generated.
The sets of rotamers for each axis are used to construct output
molecules.  A multi-step process is applied to each R-group for each axis:

<p>
<ol start="1">
<li>
If present, a SMARTS filter is used to eliminate undesirable chemistry (such
as forming a peroxide).  This can be tailored for individual R-groups and
is stored in the R-group library.
<p>
<li>
The Torsion Driver (described below) is used to generate all possible
rotamers.  Clashes with the scaffold and the receptor (if present) are
removed via a soft clash energy filter.
<p>
<li>
Duplicate and/or high-energy structures are removed and the remaining
rotamers are sorted by increasing energy.
</ol>

<a name="TorsDriver"></a>
<h3>Torsion Driver</h3>
<p>
Many modeling applications require finding the minimum-energy or the set
of low-energy rotamers about a bond:

<p align="center">
<img src="frag_combi/bondrot3.png" alt="Bond Rotation Example" /></p>

The <a href="../moe/gui/mainwin.htm#FooterEditing">Profile</a> button in
the MOE footer is such an example, using the current forcefield
to provide a graphical tool to review and set the torsion angle of the
selected bond.

<p>
The Torsion Driver assumes that a library of rigid-body R-groups
(which might be large) will be oriented about an axis defined by a rotatable bond.
As with
<a href="../apps/ph4_search.htm">pharmacophore search</a>,
R-group libraries should contain one or more
conformations of each structure as appropriate.
The possible positions of R-group atoms can be visualized as a cylindrical
grid, with each point specified by a particular distance along the bond axis
and distance perpendicular to the axis.  Interaction energies with the
scaffold (and
the receptor if present) can be calculated at each point using a soft
clash 800R3 potential:


<span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{align}
E_{ij} = 800 \sqrt{\epsilon_{i} \epsilon_{j}} \left[ 1 - \frac{r_{i}}{R_{i} + R_{j}} \right]^{3}
\end{align}
</span>

<p>
where atom <span class='LaTeX'>\(i\)</span> is an sp3 carbon probe and atom <i>j</i> is an
atom of the scaffold or receptor.
<span class='LaTeX'>\(\epsilon_{i}\)</span> and
<span class='LaTeX'>\(\epsilon_{j}\)</span> are
the van der Waals well-depths (in kcal/mol), <span class='LaTeX'>\(r_{ij}\)</span> is the
point-atom distance and
<span class='LaTeX'>\(R_{i}\)</span>
and <span class='LaTeX'>\(R_{j}\)</span> are the van der Waals radii.
The parameters are modified OPLS-AA van der Waals parameters tuned to
reproduce the free energy of solvation of a collection of small molecules.
A clash energy cutoff can be used to exclude points with unfavorable
interactions with the scaffold (or protein, if present).  This yields
the set of positions where a R-group atom is sterically allowed:

<p align="center">
<img src="frag_combi/bonddots4.png" alt="Bond Axis Example" /></p>

In this example, you can see the grid of valid atom locations (in green)
along with
the regions excluded by contact with the receptor or scaffold.  Receptor
excluded volumes are located at the top and bottom (white regions) and
the scaffold excluded volume is indicated at the right.  
The atoms of
a small portion of the receptor are shown as space-filled spheres, which lie
in an excluded region.

<p>
The clash grid can be used to reduce the number of rotamers that must be
examined when adding an R-group to the scaffold.  Each R-group (passing
any SMARTS filter that might be present) is joined to the scaffold in a
standard orientation and the position of the R-group atoms relative to the
grid is determined.  The location of each atom is used to define a
circular set of points at a common distance and radius about the bond
axis:

<p align="center">
<img src="frag_combi/bondarcs3.png" alt="Atom Allowed Example" /></p>

The points in blue define the permitted positions for each atom (several
are superimposed).  The indicated gaps
for the meta hydrogen atoms result from steric clash with the receptor.
The specific geometry of the pyridyl group does not clash with the scaffold,
so there are no restrictions on the ortho hydrogens.  The radial resolution
of the clash grid used to generate these points was 5 degrees.

<p>
For calculations involving free rotors (such as <b>-CH<sub>3</sub></b> or
<b>-NH<sub>2</sub></b>), the Combinatorial Builder (by default) assumes the
hydrogen positions are not well-defined.  In such cases (below left), an
initial scan is done:

<ol start="1">
<li>Substitute a methyl for the selected hydrogen.
<p><li>Generate the unique, low-energy rotamers for the bond connecting the
terminal heavy atom to the scaffold
(in this case <b>-CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub></b>).
<p><li>Record the position(s) of the carbon atom of the methyl group.
<p><li>Restore the original molecule.
</ol>

<p><table align="center">
<tr>
<td><img src="frag_combi/rotpix1b.png" alt="Original Selection" />
<td><img src="frag_combi/rotpix2b.png" alt="Low-Energy Alternatives" />
<tr>
<td align="center">original selection
<td align="center">low-energy alternatives
</table></p>

The position(s) of the methyl carbon atom (above right) are used as attachment
point locations and the rotamers for each generated axis are combined.  This
results in better sampling of the available conformation space of the free
rotor.  This process is not used if more than one hydrogen on the heavy atom
is selected.  Fixed atoms are considered invariant.

<p>
The circular set of points associated with each R-group atom can be expressed
as bit strings, where 1 is an allowed location and 0 is a forbidden one.
These can be compared if they are transformed into a standard orientation
relative to the bond axis.  This is done via circular shifts, rotating each
set of bits by an offset set to the
negative of the atom's initial torsion angle.  In the pyridyl example
above, the offsets would be 0<sup style="font-size: 70%">o</sup> and
180<sup style="font-size: 70%">o</sup>, but the specific geometry of
individual R-groups determines the offset for each atom.   Once transformed,
a boolean AND of the 1's and 0's of the transformed sets yields the torsion
angle subset that must be checked.

<p>
A toy example is provided below, using a low-resolution grid with a radial
resolution of 30 degrees (12 points per circular set).
The R-group is assumed to have an arbitrary 3D geometry, with different
offsets for each atom.  The bits for four of the atoms are shown below left:

<p align="center">
<img src="frag_combi/andOp2.png" alt="Angle Subset Example" /></p>

The bits in <font color="red">red</font> are those that must be circularly
shifted to transform them into standard orientation.  Once this is done,
the bits on the right can be ANDed together to yield the torsion angle
subset.  These are indicated in <font color="#3090C7">blue</font>,
corresponding
to 30<sup style="font-size: 70%">o</sup>,
210<sup style="font-size: 70%">o</sup> and
330<sup style="font-size: 70%">o</sup> angles.  This can greatly reduce
the number of forcefield calculations required to generate rotamers,
particularly for cases involving tight receptor pockets.  If multiple
attachment points are generated, the boolean calculation is performed for
each and the results are merged.

<p>
The rotamer energy must be calculated for each value in the torsional angle
subset, given by

<span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{align}
\textbf{E}_{rot} = \textbf{E}_{rp} + \left( \textbf{E}_{rs} - \textrm{min } \textbf{E}_{rs} \right)
\end{align}
</span>

where <span class='LaTeX'>\(\textbf{E}_{rp}\)</span>
is the R-group/protein energy and
<span class='LaTeX'>\(\textbf{E}_{rs}\)</span> is the R-group/scaffold energy.
<span class='LaTeX'>\(\textbf{E}_{rp}\)</span> is calculated from the van der Waals and charge
terms of the current forcefield, while <span class='LaTeX'>\(\textbf{E}_{rs}\)</span> uses these
terms along with the torsional energy of the R-group/scaffold bond.
As the system is a rigid rotor, the other terms are constant and
can be ignored.  The second term is
always positive and is a conformation energy penalty for higher-energy
rotamers.  Duplicates, defined as higher-energy rotamers within the specified
torsional angle window, and rotamers failing the maximum energy threshold are
removed. The remaining rotamers (if any) are returned (sorted by increasing
<span class='LaTeX'>\(\textbf{E}_{rot}\)</span>).

<h3>Construct Molecule</h3>
<p>
The information provided by the Torsion Driver for each bond is used
to construct candidate molecules.  This is a two-step process:

<p>
<ol start="1">
<li>
For each bond, all rotamers whose <span class='LaTeX'>\(\textbf{E}_{rp}\)</span> exceeds the
Protein-Ligand Clash Energy parameter and/or all rotamers whose
<span class='LaTeX'>\(\textbf{E}_{rs}\)</span> exceeds the Intra-Ligand Clash Energy parameter
are discarded.
<p>
<li>
If only one bond is present, the axis rotamer energy is used as the
candidate molecule energy.  However, if more than one bond is present,
the conformation energy penalty for R-group interactions must be determined
as well.  The candidate molecule energy becomes:

<span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{align}
\textbf{E}_{mol} =
    \sum_{bond} \textbf{E}_{bond}
    + \sum_{i \lt j} \left( \textbf{E}_{ij} - \textrm{min } \textbf{E}_{ij} \right)
\end{align}
</span>

where <span class='LaTeX'>\(\textbf{E}_{bond}\)</span> is the rotamer energy returned by the Torsion
Driver and <span class='LaTeX'>\(\textbf{E}_{ij}\)</span> is the interaction energy between R-groups
<span class='LaTeX'>\(i\)</span> and <span class='LaTeX'>\(j\)</span>.
Candidate molecules exceeding the maximum
energy threshold are discarded.
</ol>

<h3>Filters</h3>
<p>
Constructed molecules can be filtered in three ways.  First, a
<a href="../quasar/fcnref/descrfcn.htm#DescriptorExprSyntax">
Descriptor Filter</a> can be specified and the calculated MOE
<a href="../quasar/descr.htm">Descriptors</a>
must satisfy the range/boolean values specified.  Second, a
<a href="../quasar/modcomp.htm#Composer">Model file</a> can be provided,
and each new molecule must satisfy the specified criterion.  Finally,
a pharmacophore query can be provided, which the absolute positions of each
new molecule must satisfy.
Structures failing any of these filters are discarded.  For the
molecules that pass the filters, all calculated properties are written
to the output database.

<h3>Synthetic Score</h3>
<p>
A <a href="../moe/fcnref/rsynthfcn.htm">Synthetic Feasibility Score</a> is
calculated for every new molecule that has passed the specified filters.
This is a score in the range of 0 to 1 with 1 meaning fully synthesizable
and 0 meaning not feasible.  This can be used as a term in the
Descriptor Filter via the <tt>rsynth</tt> descriptor.

<h3>Refine + Score</h3>
<p>
If a receptor is present,
<a href="docking.htm#Refinement">Forcefield Refinement</a> can be used to
relax each new molecule in the pocket.  Sidechains can be treated flexibly
(with or without a tether), but backbone atoms are always held fixed.
This generates an energy score using the
<a href="../moe/pot.htm#Equation">Generalized Born solvation model (GB/VI)</a>
[Labute&nbsp;2008].  This value, along with the protein coordinates if the
sidechains were not fixed, is written to the output database.
Molecules can be scored using one of the methods in MOE's
<a href="docking.htm#Scoring">Docking</a> application.

If the
<tt>London&nbsp;dG</tt> score is calculated, the ligand efficiency (estimated
pKi divided by the number of heavy atoms) is also written to the output
database.

<p>
If no Receptor is present, tethered minimization (using the current forcefield)
can be used to generate relaxed structures with as little global change
in ligand alignment or orientation as possible.  A variable, parabolic
force constant is applied to each heavy atom of the scaffold.
This allows the portion of the scaffold in each new structure proximate to
the R-groups to relax freely while preserving the overall geometry.

<p>
If a pharmacophore query filter is used, minimization or refinement will
use forcefield restraints between the features in the query and the
pharmacophore annotations in the molecule.  Such restraints will only be
applied if the pharmacophore query uses the
<a href="ph4_annot.htm">Unified Annotation Scheme</a>.

<!-- =============================== EXAMPLE ============================= -->

<p>
<a name="Example"></a>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>
In this section we will present a number of example calculations using the
Combinatorial Builder, using both user-specified and default R-group libraries.

<div class="example">

<h3>Prepare Input</h3>
<p>
<ol start="1">
<li><i>Prepare the protein/ligand pair.</i><br />
First clear the system:
<p class="indent_novspace">
<span class="menu">MOE | File | Close</span></p><br />
Open the PDB file:
<p class="indent_novspace">
<span class="menu">MOE | File | Open</span></p>
In the Open panel, select
<span class="nobr"><tt>$MOE/sample/mol/1ioe.pdb</tt></span>.<br /><br />
Set the optimal protonation state:
<p class="indent_novspace">
<span class="menu">MOE | Compute | Prepare | Protonate 3D</span></p>
Take the default options and press <b>OK</b>.  This will take a minute or
so to complete.<br /><br />
Hide the Receptor, ribbons and hydrogen atoms:
<p class="indent_novspace">
<span class="menu">RHS | Hide | Receptor</span></p>
<p class="indent_novspace">
<span class="menu">MOE | Footer | Ribbon | Style | 
<img src="../tutorials/protalign_tut/apat_image011.png" alt="ribbon style" style="vertical-align: bottom;" />
</span></p>
<p class="indent_novspace">
<span class="menu">RHS | Hydrogens</span></p><br />
Select and delete pyridine terminal group:
<p class="indent_novspace">
<span class="menu">RHS | Delete</span></p>
This creates a hydrogen that will be used in the next two examples.<br /><br />
Save it to disk:
<p class="indent_novspace">
<span class="menu">MOE | File | Save</span></p>
In the Save panel, enter
<span class="nobr"><tt>CBtest.moe</tt></span>.  This can be used
when rerunning the sample calculations.
<p>
<li><i>Start the Combinatorial Builder.</i>
<p class="indent_novspace">
<span class="menu">MOE | Compute | Fragments | Combinatorial Builder</span></p>
Ensure that the Receptor set is set to Receptor Atoms and the Ligand set is
set to Ligand Atoms.  Toggle on
<span class="nobr"><b>Open Database Viewer</b></span> to see the output
as it is created.
</ol>
</div>

<div class="example">

<h3>Simple Addition</h3>

<ol start="1">
<li>
<div class="floatright">
<img src="frag_combi/selpix1.png" alt="Single Bond Selection">
</div>

<i>Decrease the filtering.</i><br />
Change the <b>Descriptor Filter</b> to <tt>Weight<600</tt>
<tt>SlogP[-4,8]</tt> <tt>TPSA[40,140]</tt>.  This increases the maximum
molecular weight that will be accepted.
<p>
<li>
<i>Set up the calculation.</i><br />
Select the hydrogen created when setting up <span class="nobr">
<tt>CBtest.moe</tt></span> (it should be the only one visible).  The
atoms should be labeled <font color="#00CC00"><b>A1</b></font> and the
GUI will indicate a single connection is present.
</ol>

<p>
Press <b>Search</b> to start the Combinatorial
Builder.  The calculation will run quickly as the default library,
<span class="nobr"><tt>$MOE/lib/buildfrag.mdb</tt></span>, is small.
Progress is reported at the bottom of the GUI.  The output molecules have
molecular weights less than 600,
logP's in the range of -4 to 8 and TPSA in the range of 40 to 140.
The <span class="nobr"><b>SVL Commands</b></span> window provides information
about the calculation.

</div>

<div class="example">

<h3>Variable Free Rotor</h3>

<ol start="1">
<li>
<div class="floatright">
<img src="frag_combi/selpix2.png" alt="Free Rotor Selection">
</div>

<i>Show the hydrogens.</i><br />
Clear the atom selection, and display the hydrogens:
<span class="menu">RHS | Hydrogens
<p>
<li>
<i>Set up the calculation.</i><br />
Select one of the hydrogens of the terminal methyl group.  As above, the
GUI will indicate a single connection is present.
</ol>

<p>
Press <b>Search</b> to start the Combinatorial Builder.  The portion of the
scaffold containing the selected atom is outside the cleft, so it is likely
that the <b>-O-CH<sub>3</sub></b> rotor will have several possible positions.
The calculation should take less than a minute, with progress reported at
the bottom of the GUI and in the
<span class="nobr"><b>SVL Commands</b></span> window.

<p>
You can examine the output, <tt>combibuild.mdb</tt> in the Database
Viewer.  There are roughly 1200 structures, with multiple rotamers
associated with each R-group.  Browsing the first few structures shows
the orientations for each generated attachment point.

</div>

<div class="example">

<h3>Combinatorial Building</h3>

<ol start="1">
<li>
<i>Load the scaffold.</i><br />
First, clear the system:
<p class="indent_novspace">
<span class="menu">RHS | Close</span></p><br />
Open the scaffold database:
<p class="indent_novspace">
<span class="menu">RHS | Open</span></p>
In the Open panel, select
<span class="nobr"><tt>$MOE/sample/mol/gmp_scaffold.mdb</tt>
</span>and press <b>OK</b>.<br />
Double click on the molecule to load it into MOE.
<p>
<li>
<i>Specify the connections</i><br />
Press <b>Define Connections...</b> in the GUI.  This brings up the
<span class="nobr"><b>Edit Connections</b></span> window.
In the <b>R-group</b> file browser, enter
<span class="nobr"><tt>$MOE/sample/mol</tt></span> and hit return.  This shows
a collection of databases under <b>Files</b>.<br /><br />
The four R-group libraries are <tt>gmp_r1.mdb</tt>, <tt>gmp_r2.mdb</tt>,
<tt>gmp_r3.mdb</tt> and <tt>gmp_r4.mdb</tt>.  Select each in turn and
press <span class="nobr"><b>Add Connection</b></span> or by double-clicking
in the file list. The panel should look like this:

<p align=center><img src="frag_combi/EditSel.png" alt="Connections Panel"></p>

Press <b>OK</b> to accept the connections.
<p>
<li>
<div class="floatright">
<img src="frag_combi/selpix3.png"
alt="Atom Name Selection" />
</div>

<i>Increase the filtering.</i><br />
Change the <b>Descriptor Filter</b> to <tt>Weight<250</tt>.  This decreases
the maximum molecular weight that will be accepted and removes the logP and
TPSA filters.
<p>
<li>
<i>Set up the calculation.</i><br />
Change the Receptor Atom set to <b>None</b>.<br />
Change <b>Specify connection points</b> to <b>Atom Names</b>.  The
atoms with names <b>A1...A4</b> are labeled in green.  The GUI indicates
there are 4 Connections and 6480 possible combinations to examine.
</ol>

<p>
Press <b>Search</b> to start the Combinatorial Builder.  The calculation
should take a few seconds, and generate roughly 1300 structures.  Progress
is reported at the bottom of the GUI and in the <b>SVL Commands</b> window.

<p>
You can examine the output, <tt>combibuild.mdb</tt> in the Database
Viewer.  As no receptor is present, <b>ERgr</b> (the R-group energies)
reflects only R-group/scaffold and R-group/R-group conformation energy
penalties.  You can extend the size of the <b>mol</b> field to see which
R-groups were used to create each output molecule, or browse the results
to see the various structures and rotamers that were generated.
