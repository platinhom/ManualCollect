<!-- OVERVIEW -->

<a name="Overview"></a>
<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
The purpose of Site Finder is to calculate possible active sites in
a receptor from the 3D atomic coordinates of the receptor.  Such a
calculation is useful for site-directed
mutagenesis experiments to help determine potential sites for ligand
binding docking calculations or for calculating restriction sets for
rendering partial molecular surfaces or for MultiFragment Search.
</p>

<p>
Methods such as
[Goodford&nbsp;1985] or [Miranker&nbsp;1991] use interaction energies between
the receptor and different probes in an attempt to locate energetically
favorable sites.
While van der Waals energies can indicate sterically available
regions, the long-range nature of electrostatic potentials make the
interpretation of energy levels difficult (e.g. a carboxylate in an active
site will emphasize positively charged probes even though negatively charged
probes like carbonyl oxygen may be part of the bound ligand).
Alternatively, purely geometric methods seek to locate "pockets" without
the use of energy models.  This is advantageous since proton locations are
not required.  LigSite [Hendlich&nbsp;1997] uses a grid representation of the
molecular volume and computes exterior site scores by projecting rays from
the receptor exterior to the surface.  The deeper and more surrounded a
site is, the higher its score.  [DelCarpio&nbsp;1993] uses an analytical
geometric algorithm to compute pocket sites.

<p>
MOE's Site Finder falls into the category of geometric methods since
no energy models are used.  Instead, the relative positions and accessibility
of the receptor atoms are considered along with a rough classification of
chemical type.
The Site Finder methodology is based upon Alpha Shapes [AlphaShapes] which are
a generalization of convex hulls developed in [Edelsbrunner&nbsp;1995].
In brief, the method is as follows:

<ol>
<li>
Identify regions of tight atomic packing. This is not the same as locating
pockets, since surface sites may still be regions of tight packing.
</li>

<p>
<li>
Filter out sites that are &quot;too exposed&quot; to solvent.  In other
words, sites that are on protrusions are unlikely to be good active sites.
</li>

<p>
<li>
Classify the sites as either hydrophobic or hydrophilic.
This coarse classification of
chemical type is used to separate water sites from the more likely
hydrophobic sites.  
Use a definition of hydrophilic that is invariant to protonation state and
tautomer state (this means no distinction between donor and acceptor atoms).
Use a definition of hydrophobic that is invariant to tautomer state
(this means that aromaticity cannot be used).
</li>

<p>
<li>
Calculate alpha spheres on the sites as follows:
Collections of 3D points in the site
are triangulated
using a modified Delaunay
triangulation.  For each resulting simplex (collection of four points)
there is an associated sphere called an <i>alpha sphere</i>.  These
spheres have differing radii including infinite radii (corresponding to the
planes of the convex hull of the point set).

<p>
<li>
The collection of alpha spheres is pruned by eliminating
those that
correspond to inaccessible regions of the receptor as well as those that
are too exposed to solvent.
In addition, only the small alpha spheres
are retained since these correspond to locations of tight atomic packing
in the receptor.

<p>
<li>
Classify the alpha spheres as either "hydrophobic"
or "hydrophilic" depending on whether the sphere is in a good hydrogen bonding
spot in the receptor.  Hydrophilic spheres not near a hydrophobic sphere
are eliminated (since these generally correspond to water sites).

<p>
<li>
Cluster the alpha spheres
using a double-linkage clustering
algorithm to produce a collection of sites.  Each site consists of one or
more alpha spheres at least one of which is hydrophobic.
</li>
</p>

<p>
<li>
Rank sites according to their Propensity for Ligand Binding (PLB) score,
which is based on the amino acid composition of the pocket as described in
[Soga&nbsp;2007].
</li>
</p>

</ol>

<!-- VALIDATION -->

<a name="Validation"></a>
<h2>Validation</h2>

<p>In order to parameterize and validate the Site Finder method, a
number of tests were performed.  The test data was chosen to be
the core dataset of PDBBind
(<a href="http://www.pdbbind.org" target="_blank">www.pdbbind.org</a>),
based on its popularity with docking studies and its
diversity.  The dataset consists of 3 examples of each of 77 diverse base
structures,
for a total of 231 structures, with the 3 examples comprising
a tight binder, a medium binder and a weak binder.
</p>

<p>The Site Finder methodology was applied to this dataset using
different clustering methods, clustering parameters, and scoring
functions.  For each structure, the full Biological Unit was generated
using REMARK 350 of the PDB file.  Redundant pockets were ignored, and
when multiple copies of a ligand&ndash;pocket complex existed due to symmetry,
any one of them was considered an equally correct prediction.  A
successful prediction was defined using the Mutual Overlap Criterion
similar to that described in [Le&nbsp;Guilloux&nbsp;2009] &ndash; namely,
50% of the ligand atoms must be within the predicted pocket and at
least 20% of the predicted pocket surface must be within 4.5&Aring;
of a ligand heavy atom.</p>

<p>Single-linkage, double-linkage, and average-linkage clustering
were each tested, and in each case, the distance cutoff was varied as well.
The PLB score was compared to a simple ranking based on number of
hydrophobic alpha spheres.  It was found that
the overall best performance was obtained
when double-linkage clustering with a connection distance of 2.5&Aring;
was employed, and PLB scoring used for ranking.
This resulted in a 63.9% success
rate on the dataset for the correct pocket being ranked first, and an
83.5% success rate for the correct pocket ranked in the top 3.
Further tests on
the larger <i>refined</i> PDBBind dataset, of which the core
was a subset, yielded 63.6% and 80.1% success rates for the top and for among
the top 3 predictions, respectively.</p>

<p>Out of the 231 structures in the core dataset, 19 found the
correct pocket, but the ranking was below 3rd place,
7 had the correct pocket predicted too large, 12 had the pocket
predicted too small,
and only in one was the correct
pocket missed altogether.</p>

<p>In light of the foregoing analysis, the method selected for
the Site Finder application was double-linkage
clustering, with a default connection distance of 2.5&Aring;,
and pocket ranking by PLB score.</p>
 
<p>A further refinement step inspired by the work of [Volkamer 2010] was found
to slightly improve performance and remove unusually large clusters, often
found at dimer interfaces, as follows.  The alpha spheres of each site were
subjected to another round of clustering with bias towards small compact
globular clusters, resulting in one or more 'subsites' for each identified
site.  Each subsite was replaced by a single point at its geometric center, and
these centers reclustered using single-linkage (for small proteins) or
double-linkage (for larger proteins) clustering, to produce a final set of
sites comprising clusters of the sub-sites.  This modification improved
performance on the core dataset to 65.8% and 87.5% success rates for the top
and for among the top 3 predictions, respectively.

<a name="Running"></a>
<h2>Running the Site Finder</h2>

<p>
To use the Site Finder, perform the following steps:

<ol>
<li>Load a receptor molecule into MOE.  The Site Finder uses only
heavy atoms so there is no need to add
hydrogens nor is there a need to set protonation states.
<p>
<li>Choose <nobr><b>MOE | Compute | Site Finder</b></nobr> to open the
Site Finder panel.
<p>
<li>Configure the options in the <b>Atoms</b> section of the panel
(see below) and press <b>Apply</b>.
</ol>

<p>The following panel will appear (although the list body will be empty
until <b>Apply</b> is pressed).

<p><center>
<img src="sitefind/sitefind_panel.png" alt="Site Finder Panel">
</center>

<p><table width=100% cellpadding=5>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Atoms</b>
<td valign="top">
The Atoms options control the interpretation of the atoms currently
loaded in MOE.  Select the appropriate collection of atoms from the list.
If <b>Solvent</b> is on, water molecules, salt ions, and common
solvents that are in the specified atom set will be retained, otherwise they
will be ignored.  If <b>Visible Only</b> is on then hidden atoms will be
ignored, otherwise they will be included.  In all cases, atoms with the Inert
attribute set will be ignored as will all Dummy atoms (LP atoms with no
bonded neighbors).

</tr><tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Site List</b>
<td valign="top">
When <b>Apply</b> is pressed, the calculated sites will be summarized in
the list.  Each site is numbered (starting from 1).  The Size column
indicates the number of alpha spheres comprising the site.  The PLB column
indicates the Propensity for Ligand Binding [Soga&nbsp;2007] score for
the contact residues in the receptor.  The Hyd column
indicates the number of hydrophobic contact atoms in the receptor.  The Side
column indicates the number of sidechain contact atoms in the receptor.
The Residues column indicates the residues that make up the calculated site
in the format <i>chain</i>:<i>residue-name</i>.  The list is sorted by
the PLB column (descending order).

</tr><tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Render</b>
<td valign="top">
The Render options control the way alpha spheres in selected sites are
displayed in the MOE window:
<ol>
<li><b>No Centers</b> does not display the alpha spheres.
<li><b>Alpha Centers</b> draws a small sphere at each alpha sphere center.
<li><b>Alpha Spheres</b> draws a sphere of radius alpha at each center.
<li><b>Pocket Surface</b> draws a smooth surface enveloping the alpha spheres.
</ol>
<p>
Red spheres indicate hydrophilic atoms, white spheres, hydrophobic.

</tr><tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Isolate</b>
<td valign="top">
Controls how atoms will be displayed and the backbone rendered
when sites are selected:

<ol>
<li><b>None</b> means no action will be taken.
<li><b>Atoms</b> means that the atoms of residues of the selected sites 
will be shown and all other atoms will be hidden.
<li><b>Backbone</b> means that only the backbone cartoon of residues of the 
selected sites will be shown.
<li><b>Atoms and Backbone</b> means that both the Atoms and Backbone rendering
will be performed.
</ol>

</tr><tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Options</b>
<td valign="top">

<p>
If <b>Select Contact Atoms</b> is on then atoms within 4.5 &Aring; of 
the selected sites will be selected and all other atoms deselected.

<p>
If <b>Select Residues in SE</b> is on then the residues in the selected 
site(s) will be selected and all other residues deselected.

<p>
If <b>Show Ligands</b> is on then the ligand in the selected sites will
be displayed, otherwise it will not be displayed.

<p>
If <b>Show Solvent</b> is on then solvent atoms in the selected sites will
be displayed, otherwise they will not be displayed.

</tr><tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Dummies...</b>
<td valign="top">
When Dummies is pressed, a dummy atom will be created for each alpha
sphere in the sites selected in the list.  The dummy atoms will have element
LP and will be named either HYD (for hydrophobic) or LPA (for lone pair
active; i.e. hydrophilic).  In addition, the temperature factor of the
dummy atom will be set to the alpha sphere radius.
The spheres for a particular site will be collected in a single residue that
is named according to the site number.
All of the site residues will be collected into a single new chain.

<p>
Press the <b>Apply</b> button to begin the Site Finder calculation (which
requires a few seconds to complete). It needs to be pressed only when the
Atoms options are changed or the molecular system is changed.  It does
not need to be pressed when list items are selected or the Highlight
options are changed.

<p>
The Settings panel controls various parameters used in the Site Finder
calculation.  It is opened by pressing the <b>Settings</b> button:

<p><center>
<img src="sitefind/settings.png" alt="Settings Panel">
</center>

<p><table width=100% cellpadding=5>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width=25%><b>Probe Radius 1</b>
<td valign="top">
The radius (in angstroms) of a hypothetical hydrophilic hydrogen bonding atom
(such as N or O).
<tr>
<td valign="top" width=25%><b>Probe Radius 2</b>
<td valign="top">
The radius (in angstroms) of a hypothetical hydrophobic atom (such as C).
<tr>
<td valign="top" width=25%><b>Isolated Donor/Acceptor</b>
<td valign="top">
If a hydrophilic alpha sphere has no hydrophobic alpha sphere within the
specified distance (in angstroms) then the hydrophilic alpha sphere is
discarded.  Set this value to a large number (e.g. 1000) if water sites
are of interest.
<tr>
<td valign="top" width=25%><b>Connection Distance</b>
<td valign="top">
Individual alpha spheres are collected into separate sites by a double-linkage
clustering algorithm.  Two clusters are merged if there are at least two pairs
of spheres (with one from each cluster) within the specified Connection
Distance (in angstroms).
<tr>
<td valign="top" width=25%><b>Minimum Site Size<br>Radius</b>
<td valign="top">
After clustering, sites with fewer than the specified number of alpha
spheres are discarded.  Sites with a bounding sphere smaller than the Radius
(in angstroms) are also discarded.  Set both of these values to 0 if water
sites are of interest.
</table>

<p>
The <b>Apply</b> button in the Settings panel needs to be pressed for changes
to take effect.  Once the settings are changed, press <b>Apply</b> in the Site
Finder panel for the changes to be used in the alpha site calculations.

<!-- A WORKED EXAMPLE -->

<a name="WorkedExample"></a>
<div class="example">
<h2>Example: Streptavidin</h2>

We shall demonstrate a use of the Site Finder with streptavidin,
the biotin receptor.  Close the current molecular system in MOE and open
<tt>$MOE/sample/mol/biotin_rec.moe</tt>.  Choose
<nobr><b>MOE | Compute | Site Finder</b></nobr> and press the <b>Apply</b>
button.

<p>
<div class="floatright">
<img src="sitefind/biotin1.gif" alt="Biotin" />
</div>

By default, the first calculated site is selected in the list and the Draw
Alpha Centers option is selected.  Thus, the first calculated site
is displayed in the MOE Window as a collection of colored spheres: red
for hydrophilic and white for hydrophobic.  In the case of
the biotin receptor, 8 sites result from the calculation.
<p>
If individual sites are selected in the list, those sites will
be rendered with alpha spheres.  Use <tt>Shift</tt>-click to select a range of
sites and use <tt>Ctrl</tt>-click to toggle individual sites in the list.
<p>
<p>
In the case of streptavidin, the first site in the list is the active site.
In general, active sites of receptors will appear near the top of the
list.  Some sites may appear lower in the list (such as surface binding
sites).  Dimer interfaces can also push the active site lower in the list.

<p>
Set <b>Isolate</b> to <b>Atoms and Backbone</b> in the Site Finder panel.
Ensure only the first site in the list is selected.  It should now be possible
to manipulate the MOE view to obtain an image similar to the one below.

<p><center>
<img src="sitefind/biotin_site.png" alt="Biotin Active Site" />
</center>

<p>This depiction of the active site of streptavidin clearly shows the
contact residues (along with the local backbone and secondary structure).
In addition, each of the alpha spheres indicates the type of atom
(red=hydrophilic, white=hydrophobic) preferred by the atoms of the site.

<p>
Hide all of the receptor atoms with
<nobr><b>MOE | Render | Hide | Receptor</b></nobr> and open
<tt>$MOE/sample/mol/biotin.moe</tt> (the ligand co-crystallized with
streptavidin).  It is now possible to compare the locations of the alpha
spheres and the locations of the ligand nuclei:

<p><center>
<img src="sitefind/biotin_ligand.png" alt="Ligand in Biotin Active Site" />
</center>

<p>Note the good correspondence between the hydrophobic alpha spheres and
the hydrophobic groups of the ligand.  The urea carbonyl group is also
well-matched, by hydrophilic alpha spheres.  Finally, the shape of the
alpha sphere collection is reasonably close to the shape of the ligand.

<p>
Press the <b>Dummies</b> button to create dummy atoms
for each alpha sphere in the active site and press the <b>Close</b> button
in the Site Finder panel.  The dummy atoms can now be used as
superposition targets for docking calculations
or as restriction sets for
rendering partial molecular surfaces.
