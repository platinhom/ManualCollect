<h2> <a name="Introduction">Introduction</a> </h2>

<p>
The purpose of the Pharmacophore Search is to use a pharmacophore query
to filter databases of 3D conformations based on the positions of annotation
points derived from each of the conformations.
The main characteristics of the Pharmacophore Search are:

<ul>
<li><b>Boolean Expressions</b>.
Query features can contain boolean expressions to encode concepts
such as &quot;Donor&nbsp;and&nbsp;not&nbsp;Cationic&quot;.
<p>
<li><b>Substructure Matching</b>.
Pharmacophore query features can be augmented with SMARTS patterns to
search for particular functional groups.  The substructure tests are
efficiently performed during the search itself (not as a post-filter).
<p>
<li><b>Volume and Shape Filtering</b>.
The query can be focused by adding restrictions on the shape of
the matched ligands in the form of a union of spheres.  Alternatively,
ligand hits can be filtered to enforce shape occupancy.  SMARTS patterns
can be applied to individual volume and shape constraints.
<p>
<li><b>Partial Matching</b>.
Only those features of the query that are marked as "essential" must be
matched to a corresponding ligand annotation point.  Other query features
may be left unmatched, resulting in a "partial match".  The search
outputs all partial matches of the query that contain at least a given
minimum number of matched features.
<p>
<li><b>Group Constraints</b>.
Match constraints can be applied to, for example,
match &quot;exactly one of&quot; a subset of features,
or to impose that a hydrogen bond heavy atom matches with its
projected feature simultaneously.
<p>
<li><b>Existing Conformations</b>.
External conformation databases can be searched efficiently since no
indexing or prior preparation steps are required.
<p>
<li><b>Systematic Matching</b>.
All possible matches of a ligand conformation and the query are
systematically examined (and are reproducible).
</ul>

<p>
The Pharmacophore Search searches databases of 3D conformations.
Existing <a href="confgui.htm">conformation databases</a> may be searched
(such as those distributed
with MOE or generated by other programs) without pre-processing.

A pharmacophore query is required for use by the Pharmacophore Search.
A query can be built manually using the
<a href="ph4_query.htm">Pharmacophore Query Editor</a>
or automatically using the
<a href="ph4_elu.htm">Pharmacophore Elucidator</a>.
</p>

</p>
A general introduction to pharmacophores can be found in
<a href="ph4_guide.htm">Introduction to Pharmacophores in MOE</a>.
</p>


<h2><a name="Methodology">Methodology</a></h2>

<p>
<a name="InputFiles"></a>
The Pharmacophore Search applies a pharmacophore query to each conformation
of each molecule in a 3D conformation database.  This database can be
in one of the following formats:

<ol>
<li><b>Unpacked MOE Molecular Database - 1 Conformation per Entry</b>.
An unpacked molecular database must contain the following fields:
    <ul>
    <li>a <i>molecule</i> field with a single conformation per entry.
    <li>an optional <i>molecule sequence</i> field with any numerical
	field such as the molecule sequence number.  The conformations
	of the same molecules are stored in consecutive entries that
	share the same molecule sequence number.
	Use of this field is optional: if the molecule sequence field
	is not used, the molecule sequence is calculated from the molecule
	field.
     </ul>

The unpacked database is the default way of storing
molecular conformations in MOE.

<p>
<li><b>Packed MOE Molecular Database - 1 Molecule per Entry</b>.
A packed molecular database must contain the following fields:
    <ul>
    <li>a <i>molecule</i> field containing a (possibly 2D) molecule.
    <li>a <i>conformation</i> field containing multiple conformation coordinates
	of the atoms in the molecule field, compressed into a single binary vector.
	The name of the conformation field must be formed by appending
	the suffix <tt>':conf'</tt> to the name of the molecule field,
	e.g. <tt>'mol:conf'</tt>.

	Optionally, the conformation field may also store the energies of
	the compressed conformations.

	The presence or absence of the conformation field indicates that
	the database is packed or unpacked, respectively.
    </ul>

The packed database must be generated from an unpacked version using
the <tt>db_ConfPack</tt> utility function.

<p>
<a name="OMEGA"></a>
<li><b>OMEGA OEB - 1 Molecule per SD Entry</b>.
    <ul>
    <li>The OEB file must have been previously generated by the OMEGA program
	and given extension <tt>.oeb</tt> or <tt>.oeb.gz</tt>.

    <li>A special extractor is used to convert (at run-time) the OEB data
	into SD format with a special convention on conformation and
	energy encoding.

    <li>The default name of the extractor is <tt>'oeb2sdconf'</tt>.
	The user can specify a different name
	by setting the RC variable <tt>'oe_omega'</tt>, e.g.
	<br><tt>
	&nbsp; &nbsp;
	    SetRC ['oe_omega', 'my_new_oeb2sdconf']
	</tt><br>

    <li>The extractor is expected to be an executable file located either
	in the <tt>$MOE_DIR/bin/</tt> directory or one of the directories
	listed in the <tt>$PATH</tt> environment variable. 

    </ul>

Searching OEB files is only possible on machines that have access
to the OMEGA OEB extractor.  The OEB extractor is not a part of MOE
distribution files.

</ol>

<p>The database type is automatically detected from the specified input file.

<p>
<a name="OutputFields"></a>
Given a pharmacophore query and a collection of conformation files, the
Pharmacophore Search will produce a MOE Molecular Database with the
following fields (all of which are optional):

<blockquote><dl>
<dt><b>Molecule: <tt>mol</tt></b> (molecule)
<dd>
Contains the conformations found in the input databases
possibly rotated and translated to match the pharmacophore query.
<p>
<dt><b>RMSD: <tt>rmsd</tt></b> (float)
<dd>
The root of the mean square distance between the query features and
their matching ligand annotation points.
<p>
<dt><b>Sequence: <tt>mseq</tt></b> (int)
<dd>
An integer value that has the properties of a molecule sequence number.
The value of the field starts at 1 and is incremented with every new
hit molecule.
<p>
<dt><b>Row: <tt>row</tt></b> (int)
<dd>
The entry number of the matched conformation
in the searched input database.
<p>
<dt><b>Map: <tt>hitmap</tt></b> (int)
<dd>
A numerical representation of the mapping between the query
features and their matching ligand annotation points.  All
annotation points are distinguished, regardless of their symmetry.
For each feature of the query, the field stores the index of the
matched ligand annotation point or 0 if the feature is not
matched.

</dl></blockquote>

<p>
The search compares each ligand conformation in the database to
the query.  Instead of formal output, the algorithm can select
hits in an opened Molecular Database Viewer.
The algorithm for generating matches is as follows.

<p>
<blockquote>
<a name="FindMatch"></a>
<b>Input</b>: A single molecular conformation and a query.
<br><b>Output</b>: New entries in a database of hits created as the
output of Pharmacophore Search.
<p>
For each possible mapping between the query features
and the ligand annotation points:

<p><b>Step 1a</b>.

If the set of labels present on the ligand annotation points does not
satisfy the expressions associated with the matched query features,
reject the mapping.

<p><b>Step 1b</b>.

If the distances between the ligand annotation points do not agree with
the distances between the matched query features (after discounting the
radial tolerances), reject the mapping.


<p><b>Step 2</b>.
If the matched query features do not satisfy the additional
group constraints, reject the mapping.

<p><b>Step 3</b>.
Superpose the ligand annotation points and the matched query features
using rigid-body superposition.  If the ligand features fail to fall
within the specified tolerance radii of the matched query features,
reject the mapping.  During the superposition, the relative weights
of the matched query features are inversely proportional to their radii.

<p><b>Step 4</b>.
Read the atoms of the ligand from the database and superpose the ligand
atoms onto the query using the superposition transformation calculated
in Step 3.  If any of the ligand atoms violate any of the
volume restrictions in the query, reject the mapping.

<p><b>Step 5</b>.

If the mapping has not been rejected, there is a "hit".
Report the result by increasing the hit count.

<p><b>Step 6</b>.

If there is a hit
and there is an output database,
generate a new entry in the output database.
The amount and nature of the information written to the
output database for each match found is customizable.

<p><b>Step 7</b>.

If there is a hit,
and only one hit per conformation or
one hit per molecule is requested or
there is no output database,
skip all remaining mappings.

</blockquote>

<p><b>Note!</b>
Steps <b>1a</b> and <b>1b</b> are accomplished using a special low-level
state machine that iteratively generates all subgraph isomorphisms of clique
graphs with labeled edges and vertices that satisfy given constraints.
The state machine is accessed with the SVL built-in functions
<a class="svl" href="../svl/fcnref/dmatch.htm">dmatch_XXX</a>.


<h2> <a name="RunningSearch">Running Pharmacophore Search</a> </h2>

<p>
MOE's Pharmacophore Search is used to apply a query to a database
of ligand conformations and report those conformations that satisfy
the query.  The query must have been created
with MOE's Pharmacophore Query Editor.

<p>The Pharmacophore Search panel can be opened using one of the following
methods:

<ul>

<li>From the Database Viewer, choose
<nobr><b>DBV | Compute | Pharmacophore | Search...</b></nobr>.

<li>From the Pharmacophore Query Editor press the <b>Search</b> button at
the bottom of the panel.  Use the Open panel that appears to choose the
database of conformations to be searched and press <b>OK</b>.

</ul>

The following panel appears:
<br clear="both" />

<p align=center><img src="ph4_search/ph4_search.png" width="400px" 
alt="Pharmacophore Search panel"></p>

<p>If the input database is in the packed format, the
<b>Sequence</b> option will be replaced by a <b>Conf</b> textfield
showing the name of the conformation field.

<p align="center"><img src="ph4_search/molconf.png">

<h3><a name="InputSettings"></a>Input Settings</h3>
<br clear="both" />
<p><div class="floatright">
<img src="ph4_search/browse.png" width="400px" 
alt="browse in Pharmacophore Search" />
</div></p>

The <b>Input</b> database shows the name of the database(s) to be searched.
The <b>Open</b> button (to its right) is provided as a convenience to open
the specified database in a Database Viewer (if possible).
If the <b>Entries</b> or <b>Hits</b> options are to be used in the search,
the Database Viewer must be opened.
<p>
The <b>Input</b> field is not directly editable but can be changed using the
<b>Browse</b> button to the right whereupon a panel (depicted to the right)
will appear. 
It is possible to specify more than one database on which to operate the
search.
Locate as many databases as desired, and double click or select then press
<b>Add</b>. The <b>Remove</b> button correspondingly removes databases from
the list.
After pressing <b>OK</b>, the Pharmacophore Search window will
display the path of the database in the <b>Input</b> field if there was only
one, or <tt>(...multiple files...)</tt> if more than one.
<p>
The <b>Entries</b> option menu determines which entries to search
(subject to the <b>Subrange</b> discussed below).  The choices are:

<ul>
<li><b>All</b>.  All the input entries are searched.
<li><b>Selected</b>.  If the input database is open in the Database Viewer,
only selected entries are searched.
<li><b>Visible</b>.  If the input database is open in the Database Viewer,
only visible entries are searched.
</ul>

<p>
If <b>Subrange</b> is on, only the input entries within the specified range
(to the right) are searched.  Note that the entries searched are actually
the intersection of this subrange with the <b>Entries</b> setting above.

<p>
The <b>Molecule</b> menu specifies the name of the molecule field containing
conformations (or topology, as the case may be) to be searched.  Conformations
of the same molecule must be stored in consecutive entries or in a packed
conformations field (see <a href="#Methodology">Methodology</a> section).

<p>
The <b>Sequence</b> field specifies a data field
used to differentiate molecules in the input database when one conformation
per entry format is used.  In such a case,
conformations of a single molecule must have the same molecule sequence number
and must be stored in consecutive entries.  Different molecules must use different
sequence numbers.  If the pre-calculated field is not used, new molecules in the list
of conformations will be detected during the search by comparing the
molecular graphs.
If the Molecular Sequence field is not used,
the <b>Sequence</b> option must be set to '(none)'.


<h3> <a name="SpecifyQuery">Specifying the Query</a> </h3>


<br clear="both" />

<div class="floatright">
<img src="ph4_search/queryfile.png" alt="Pharmacophore Query File" />
</div>

To perform a search, a query needs to be specified.
There are two methods of specifying the query:

<ul>
<li>
<i>Specifying the query from a file</i>.
The <b>Browse</b> button next to the <b>Query</b> field allows you to use a
predefined query from a file.  The name of the query file will be displayed in
the Query text field and the Title field will show the title of the query if
one has been saved with the query.  The query file must have been created using
the Pharmacophore Query Editor.
</li>

<br clear="both" />

<div class="floatright">
<img src="ph4_search/queryedit.png" alt="Pharmacophore Query Edit" />
</div>
<li>
<i>Using the Pharmacophore Query Editor</i>.
If the Pharmacophore Search panel was opened from the Pharmacophore Query
Editor, the query is already specified.  Press <b>Edit</b> to open the
Pharmacophore Query Editor to create or modify an existing query.  If this is
the case then the <b>Browse</b> button is removed and the Query text field will
show the text 'Pharmacophore Query Editor'.
</ul>

<p>The <b>Use Absolute Positions</b> toggle allows for two methods
of determining the output molecules.
If absolute positions are used,  the molecules are assumed to be
pre-aligned and fixed in space.  The atoms of each hit molecule will <i>not</i>
be repositioned to minimize the RMSD between the query points and the
matching ligand annotation points.


<h3><a name="SearchOutput">Output Configuration</a></h3>

<p>Each ligand typically has multiple conformations.  During the search
only some may match the query. Moreover, a single conformation may match
the query in more than one way.
Pharmacophore Search offers several alternatives for viewing
the results of the search:

<ol>
<li>A report can be generated showing the number of <i>hits</i> and
other statistics.  The report is displayed in an SVL Text Editor.

<p>
<li>The conformations that matched the query can be indicated in the
searched database, either by selecting the matching entries or by
showing the matching entries and hiding all non-matches.
This functionality is controlled by the <b>Hit Entries</b> option.

<p>
<li>
A new, output database can be created that contains only the molecules
that match the pharmacophore query.  The output database is controlled by the
<b>Results</b> option.

</ol>

<p>The output of the  Pharmacophore Search window
is controlled by the following options:

<blockquote>
<p><b>Hit Entries</b>. Determines whether the search will highlight entries in
the input database that match the query, either by selecting the matching
entries or by showing the matching entries and hiding all non-matches.

The number of "hits" (matches) and other statistics can
be displayed as a textual report in an SVL Text Editor.

<p>
<br clear="both" />
<p><div class="floatright">
<img src="ph4_search/results.png" alt="Results Panel" />
</div>
<b>Results</b>.

Determines the contents of the output database:

<ul>

<li><b>No Output</b>. No output database is generated.  The
number of hit molecules is still written to the CLI and displayed in the
search status area of the window.  The hit conformations can still be
highlighted in the Database Viewer of the input database using the
<b>Hit Entries</b> option.  Choosing "No Output" desensitizes the rest
of this section and generates no output database.

<p><li><b>Conformations</b>.  Generates an output database that
contains alignments of the input conformations that match the query.
The <b>Hits</b> option further determines whether all or only some of the
hit conformations are to be output. The fields to be generated are
determined by the toggles in the <b>Setup Page</b> (press the <b>Setup</b> 
button) of this panel. The fields to be copied from the search database are also
 chosen from the <b>Setup Page</b> via the list of field names.

<p>If <b>Use Absolute Positions</b> is set, the conformations are <i>not</i>
aligned to match the query.  Note: multiple hits of one conformation
can still be reported in the output, each corresponding to a different
matching of query features to the ligand annotation points .

<p><li><b>Molecules</b>.  Generates an output database that is
a subset of the input database, which contains only hit molecules.
If any conformation of a molecule matches the query, then <i>all</i>
conformations of that molecule will be copied to the output, as-is.
All other fields of the input database are also copied to the output database.
</ul>

<p><b>Output</b>. Name of the output database to contain the
matching conformations.  The <b>Mode</b> determines
whether the new result replaces any previous data stored in
the output database or appends to the existing data.  The three options are:

<ul>
<li><b>Create</b>. Creates a new output database or rewrites an existing
database.  Before a non-empty output database is to be rewritten, the user
is prompted for confirmation.

<p><li><b>Append</b>. Creates a new output database or appends to an existing
database.

<p><li><b>Rewrite</b>. Similarly to <b>Create</b>, this case also
creates a new output database or rewrites an existing database.
In this case, however, there <i>no warning</i> given when a non-empty
database is about to be rewritten.
</ul>

<p><b>Hits</b>. Restrict the matches that are reported when <b>Results</b> is
set to "Conformations".

<ul>
<li><b>All</b>.
Reports all matches found.

<p><li><b>First&nbsp;Per&nbsp;Conformation</b>.
Reports only the first match found for any conformation.

<p><li><b>First&nbsp;Per&nbsp;Molecule</b>.
Reports only the first match found for any molecule.

<p><li><b>Best&nbsp;Per&nbsp;Conformation</b>.
Reports only the N lowest RMSD matches found for any conformation. The number
of best conformations written to the output (N) can be 
specified using the <b>N:</b> field.

<p><li><b>Best&nbsp;Per&nbsp;Molecule</b>.
Reports only the N lowest RMSD matches found for any Molecule. The number
of best molecules written to the output (N) can be 
specified using the <b>N:</b> field.

</ul>

<p><b>Setup</b>.
The output database can be specified to contain a copy of any or all
of the fields in the input database as well as the results of the
search.
The choice of fields to write to the output database is defined in the
<b>Setup Page</b> of the Pharmacophore Search panel. To see this page
press the <b>Setup</b> button.  The following is displayed:

<p align="center"><img src="ph4_search/settings.png" alt="Settings Panel" /></p>

<p>The <b>Generated Fields</b> toggles on the left side of the page are
possible output fields as described in the methodology section <a
href="#OutputFields">Output Fields</a>.

<p>The list of <b>Copied Fields</b>
shows the fields of the input database.
Fields selected in this list will be
copied from the input database to the output database.
Fields with names identical to names of generated
fields will not be copied.

<p>Press <b>Back</b> to return to the page containing the search controls.

</blockquote>

<h3><a name="ExecuteSearch">Executing the Search</a></h3>

<p>
Once the input database, the query, and the output settings have
been specified, the search can be executed.
Press the <b>Search</b> button
at the bottom of the Pharmacophore Search panel.
Progress of the search is shown in the status line at the bottom
of the panel.
When the search is complete, the word 'Finished'
appears in the  status line and the number of
hits (matches) appears next to it.

<p>
To see the results of the search, the <b>Open</b> button can be
used to open the output database.
Each entry in the output database shows the conformation
aligned with the query.
Each alignment corresponds to one possible mapping of
ligand annotation points and the query features.

<p>
A report can be produced that summarizes various statistics
regarding the results of the last pharmacophore search of the query
against the conformation database.
To create the report, press the <b>Report</b> button at the bottom of the
Pharmacophore Search panel.  The report is displayed in an SVL Text
Editor and is divided into sections.

<p>
The command section records the parameters used in the search.  It does so in
the form of an SVL command that can be executed to repeat the search.  This
code fragment can be copied and pasted directly into an SVL program or the
CLI. Note, however, that if the query was taken from the Pharmacophore Query
Editor instead of a file then the second parameter will say:
<nobr><tt>[... Pharmacophore Query Editor Data ...]</tt></nobr> instead of a
filename.  The following is an example of the command section:

<pre>
    COMMAND:
    ph4_Search [
	'work.mdb',
	'serotonin.ph4',
	[

	    use_o_rowfield     : 0,
	    use_out_dbfile     : 1
    ]];
</pre>

<p>
The query section summarizes the query used in the search.  It includes
the title of the query, the number of features, group constraints, and
volumes comprising it, and the minimum number of features
required to be matched.  The following is an example of the query
section:

<pre>
    QUERY:
        Title: Serotonin Agonist Query
        Features: 4,  Constraints: 1,  Volumes: 1
        Minimum Match Size: 4
</pre>

<p>
The timing section gives measurements of the speed of the search.  The
information shown consists of the duration of the entire search in seconds, and
then data for individual parts of the search.  For each item we give the total
number of instances of that item that were found, the average time in seconds
spent processing each such item, and the same speed expressed alternatively as
the number of instances of that item processed per second.

<p>The following information is given:

<blockquote>

<b>molecules</b>.
Molecules in the input database.  Each molecule can be represented
by several conformations.

<br><b>conformations</b>.   Conformations in the input database.

<br><b>hit molecules</b>.
Molecules for which at least one mapping has been found
that satisfies the query.

<br><b>hit conformations</b>.
Conformations for which at least one mapping has been found
that satisfies the query.

<br><b>all hits</b>.
Mappings of query features to ligand annotation points that
satisfy the query.  There may be multiple mappings for the
same conformation.
</blockquote>

<p>The following is an example of a time section:

<pre>

<!--
<p>
The last section summarizes the number of items processed.

Filters lists the
number of mappings produced at each stage of the search algorithm (the <a

Number of mappings that satisfied the distance constraints
of the query.  (These mappings are generated by the low-level
state machine in steps 1a and 1b of FindMatch.)

<br><b>constraint hits</b>.
Mappings that also satisfied the group constraints of the query.
(Step 2 of FindMatch.)

<br><b>position hits</b>.
Mappings that, after rigid-body superposition, satisfied the
positional constraints of the query.  (Step 3 of FindMatch.)

<h3>MOE/cluster</h3>

<p>
When Pharmacophore Search is used in MOE/cluster, all computation nodes
(instances of MOE/batch) must be located the same file system and be able
to use the same pathnames to locate the source and destination databases.
Each node will then search a different portion of the source database set
and output a temporary file that contains the search result for that portion.
The root node will then collate the partial results into one output file and
delete the temporary files.
</p>
<p>
The application will automatically detect the presence of additional computation
nodes in MOE/cluster.
