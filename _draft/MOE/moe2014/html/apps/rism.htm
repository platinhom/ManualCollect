<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>

The MOE Solvent Analysis application uses the 3D-RISM (three-dimensional
reference interaction site model) method to analyze the role of solvent
in macromolecular systems. The application computes a time-averaged
distribution of water H and O densities, along with free-energy maps for
analyzing solvent stability and solvation contributions to binding
free-energy.  A unique feature of 3D-RISM is its ability to include
various concentrations of salt or hydrophobic molecules as part of the
solvent, thereby producing density maps for ions and hydrophobic groups
as well as for water.  The Solvent Analysis tool can be applied to
various water-related tasks such as water placement in low resolution
X-ray protein structures, estimating solvent effects in protein-ligand
binding, and designing ligands to exploit solvation effects such as
water displacement.

<a name="SolventDistributionDensity"></a>
<h3>Solvent Distribution Density</h3>

<p>

The structure of water or any solvent can be described by measuring or
calculating the time-averaged (or ensemble averaged) spatial
distributions of the solvent atoms.  These distributions are often
computed by processing the output of molecular dynamics (MD) or
Monte-Carlo (MC) simulations to produce probability densities of finding
solvent particles (such as oxygen or hydrogen atoms) at any given point
in space. The particle densities reflect the spatial distribution of
solvent atoms, which in turn characterizes the organization of solvent
around a solute in a thermodynamic fashion.  The solute can be an apo
protein, a ligand, or a bound complex. Although solvent densities are
typically calculated by analyzing the results of long MD or MC
simulations, the 3D-RISM approach computes solvent particle density
directly by using a system of self-consistent equations to iteratively
converge density values. The advantage is that no simulations are
required, reducing run-times dramatically and rendering simulation
options (such as run-length, clustering options etc.) a non-issue.  The
results obtained with 3D-RISM are in qualitative and often even
quantitative agreement with MD for less than 0.5 % of the computer work.
More information on the origins of 3D-RISM and its computation can be
found elsewhere [Beglov 1997, Kovalenko 1999, Kovalenko 2000].

</p>

<p>

The following examples of solvent densities calculated using 3D-RISM
demonstrate how these densities reflect solvent organization. In Figure&nbsp;1,
the 3D-RISM water O and H densities are plotted around a single water
molecule. The oxygen density is in solid blue and the hydrogen density
is in white mesh.  The 3D-RISM densities reflect ensemble averages of
solvent H and O water positions. The first layer of high oxygen and
hydrogen density next to the water molecule indicates the location of H
and O atoms directly H-bonded to the water molecule.  The second layer
of density indicates the positions of H and O atoms covalently bonded to
the H-bonding partners, and is separated from the first by the length of
an O-H covalent bond.

and H water positions.  Using 3D-RISM, these quantities can be
calculated without having to run a simulation.

<p>

In Figure&nbsp;2, the 3D-RISM water O and H densities are plotted around
a single phenol molecule. The O density is in transparent blue and the H
density is in white. The 3D-RISM densities highlight the major polar
interactions between the solvent and the phenol atoms. Explicit water
molecules are also drawn to depict a potential arrangement of water
molecules that would lead to these time-averaged densities.

<p>

The ability of 3D-RISM to include ions is demonstrated in Figure&nbsp;3,
which plots the 3D-RISM sodium (Na<sup>+</sup> yellow) and chloride ion
(Cl<sup>-</sup> cyan) densities around a fixed
Na<sup>+</sup>Cl<sup>-</sup> ion pair.  The plot shows the alternating
charge layers around each of the ions.

</p>

<p>

When applied to protein-ligand complexes, the solvent density maps can
reveal solvent organization effects upon binding. In Figure&nbsp;4, the
3D-RISM water O density of the apo structure (plotted in solid blue) is
compared with the water O density of the bound complex (plotted in blue
mesh).  The ligand is a molecule of the aminopyrrolidine series bound to
Factor Xa (PDB code 2VVC). The  organization of water in the
active site is captured by 3D-RISM; the peaks of density reflect regions
of greater localization of water molecules.

<a name="SolventStabilityFreeEnergy"></a>
<h3> Solvent Stability and Free Energy </h3>

<p>Solvation free energy is also called the vacuum-to-water transfer
free energy since it corresponds to the reversible work needed to
transfer 1 mol of solute into pure water at infinite dilution.
Statistical mechanics gives a few rigorous ways of calculating this
quantity; one of them is the thermodynamic integration technique (TI)
that gives a very general formulation to compute free energies:

</p>

<span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{equation}
\Delta G_{solv}
=
    k_{B} T
    \int_{0}^{1} d \lambda
    \left< \frac{\partial U_{\lambda}}{\partial \lambda} \right>_{\lambda}
\label{eqn:1}
\end{equation}
</span>

<p>

where <span class='LaTeX'>\(k_{B}\)</span> is the Boltzmann constant,
<span class='LaTeX'>\(T\)</span> the temperature,
<span class='LaTeX'>\(U\)</span> the
potential energy and
<span class='LaTeX'>\(\lambda\)</span> a coupling parameter. The
<span class='LaTeX'>\(\lambda\)</span>
parameter provides a means of gradually increasing the interaction
between a solute molecule and water.
The angle brackets represent ensemble averages at a
given value of
<span class='LaTeX'>\(\lambda\)</span>
(at constant temperature and for a given solvent bulk density).

</p>
<p>

Typically, calculating the free energy is computationally intensive.
For example, with MD or MC, one needs to converge approximately 20 different
extensive simulations.  However, the 3D-RISM theoretical framework
is able to use a much smaller computation for evaluating the
solvation free energy by
recasting the problem in an elegant manner.
Using the single solution for the fully coupled system
<span class='LaTeX'>(\(\lambda = 1\))</span>,
<span class='LaTeX' style="white-space:nowrap">Eq. \eqref{eqn:1}</span> becomes

</p>

<span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\Delta G_{solv}
& = k_{B} T \sum_{\alpha}^{H,O}
    \int_{0}^{1} d \lambda
    \int_{V} \rho_{\alpha} \left( \vec{r}; \lambda \right)
    \frac{\partial U_{\alpha} \left( \vec{r}; \lambda \right)}{\partial \lambda}
    d V
    \\
& = \int_{V} \Delta G_{solv} \left( \vec{r} \right) d V
\end{aligned}
\label{eqn:2}
\end{equation}
</span>

<p>

where <span class='LaTeX'>\(\rho_{\alpha} \left( r; \lambda \right) \)</span>
is the number of particles, and
<span class='LaTeX'>\(\alpha\)</span>, the water Oxygen or water Hydrogen per
volume unit at a given
point <span class='LaTeX'>\(r\)</span>.
This is the density distribution function discussed previously
in units of particles per cubic angstrom. The potential energy between
the solute and the solvent average particles is computed using a
two-body additive forcefield such as the AMBER or the MMFF94 forcefields.
The key point is that the integral of
<span class='LaTeX' style="white-space:nowrap">Eq. \eqref{eqn:2}</span>
submits to analytic solution when the Hypernatted Chain or the
Kovalenko-Hirata closure relationships are used.

</p>

<p>

The consequence of the second equality in
<span class='LaTeX' style="white-space:nowrap">Eq. \eqref{eqn:2}</span> is that
contributions to the total solvation free energy can be evaluated
as a local function whose value can be computed at each point on a grid.
This grid is referred
to as a <i>solvent free energy map</i>, and can be used to compute
the free energy of solvation for a given solute.  Following the arrows
of the ligand binding thermodynamic cycle in Figure&nbsp;5, one obtains

</p>

<span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{equation}
\Delta G_{solv}^{bind}
=
      \Delta G_{solv}^{complex}
    - \Delta G_{solv}^{receptor}
    - \Delta G_{solv}^{ligand}
    + \Delta G_{gas}^{bind}
\label{eqn:3}
\end{equation}
</span>


<p align="center"><img src="rism/thermo.png" alt="panel" /></p>
<p>
<blockquote>
<b>Figure&nbsp;5. Binding Thermodynamic Cycle</b>:

The solvent contribution to ligand binding can be decomposed into three
vacuum-to-solution transfer free energies:
<span class='LaTeX'>\(\Delta G_{complex}\)</span>,
<span class='LaTeX'>\(\Delta G_{receptor}\)</span> (<i>prot</i>) and
<span class='LaTeX'>\(\Delta G_{ligand}\)</span>
(<i>lig</i>).

</blockquote>
</p>

<p>

In 3D-RISM calculations, the last term (free energy of
binding in the gas phase), which accounts for
protein-ligand interactions, will be ignored since the focus is only on
solvent effects. Substituting
<span class='LaTeX' style="white-space:nowrap">Eq. \eqref{eqn:2}</span> into
<span class='LaTeX' style="white-space:nowrap">Eq. \eqref{eqn:3}</span> yields:

</p>

<span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\Delta G_{solv}^{bind}
& = \Delta G_{solv}^{complex} - \Delta G_{solv}^{receptor} - \Delta G_{solv}^{ligand} \\
& = \int_{V} dV \left[
	  \Delta G_{solv}^{complex}  \left(\vec{r}\right)
	- \Delta G_{solv}^{receptor} \left(\vec{r}\right)
	- \Delta G_{solv}^{ligand}   \left(\vec{r}\right)
    \right] \\
& = \int_{V} d V \Delta G_{solv}^{bind} \left(\vec{r}\right)
\end{aligned}
\label{eqn:4}
\end{equation}
</span>


The consequence of <span class='LaTeX' style="white-space:nowrap">Eq. \eqref{eqn:4}</span>
is that solvation contributions to the
binding free energy are distributed over a grid, henceforth referred to as
the <i>solvent binding free energy map</i>.
<span class='LaTeX' style="white-space:nowrap">Eq. \eqref{eqn:4}</span> also leads
to interpretations for  each of the individual solvation free energy
maps. In the diagram below, idealized solvent densities and their
corresponding <span class='LaTeX'>\(\Delta G_{binding}\)</span> maps are given, along with
their interpretations.

<a name="ExplicitImplicitSolvent"></a>
<h3>Explicit vs. Implicit Solvent: The 3D-RISM Perspective</h3>

<p>
3D-RISM does not use explicit solvent in its calculations.
However, an examination of the potential of mean force calculation
under the 3D-RISM paradigm reveals that,
although solvent is treated implicitly in 3D-RISM,
it is still possible to draw inferences about explicit solvent behaviour.
This distinguishes 3D-RISM from other implicit solvent
models, in particular Poisson-Boltzmann.
</p>

<p>
The <i>potential of mean force</i> (PMF) calculation computes the reversible
work required to bring two molecular entities to
within a certain distance of each other in solvent.
When PMF is plotted against distance, explicit solvent
behaviour manifests as
maxima and minima at distances consistent with solvent shells.
In the figure below,
the potential of mean force is calculated, within the 3D-RISM
framework, for
a guanidinium and an acetate molecule being brought to
within a certain
O..H H-bond distance in pure water.
</p>

<h4 align="center">Potential of Mean Force along the Guanidinium-Acetate
H-bond</h4>
<p align="center"><img src="rism/acetate_guanidinium.png" alt="panel" /></p>

<p>
When 3D-RISM results are compared to
Poisson-Boltzmann and molecular dynamics

[Rozanska&nbsp;2000]

the first thing to note is the similarity between the 3D-RISM and MD
curves. Although shifted, the 3D-RISM curves exhibit the same kind of
explicit solvent behavior as the MD ones.
Indeed, running MD simulations at different H-bond lengths reveals that
the first maximum is due to the cost of forming a cavity in water as the
volume of the complex increases. Eventually, a single water layer
comes between the two moieties to bridge optimally at the second minima.
Two very stable water arrangements observed in an MD run are shown below
at the second MD H-bond minima.  This trend is repeated until the second
layer of bridging waters appears.  Poisson-Boltzmann
completely misses these explicit solvent effects.

</p>

<h4 align="center">Two Stable Bridging Water Configurations at the MD
Second PMF Minima</h4>
<p align="center"><img src="rism/acetate_guanidinium_md.png" alt="panel" /></p>
<p>

The following images show how 3D-RISM is able to express this
<i>explicit</i> behavior of water while not performing a simulation.
Below, the water oxygen density is rendered at positions indicated by
circles on the potential of mean force plot. The first maximum
corresponds to a large cavitation penalty. At the second minimum, both
the middle bridging water and the two bridging water arrangements as seen
in MD simulations are reproduced.  As the two ions separate further, a
second minimum forms, indicating that a second water molecule layer can
fit.

<a name="Applications"></a>
<h3>Examples of 3D-RISM Applications</h3>

<p>
The following examples demonstrate how 3D-RISM density and energy maps can
be used to analyze solvent effects in protein binding pockets.

<h4>Application: Water Placement</h4>

<p>3D-RISM can be used to analyze water placement in a binding pocket.
Figure&nbsp;6 compares the positions of crystallographic waters (yellow)
with the 3D-RISM water oxygen density plotted at two iso-levels
(solid = 3, mesh = 6).

The high density regions correspond to regions of localized water. The
higher density mesh contours are in close agreement with the X-ray water
positions. 3D-RISM does not always give a full water position, which in
a way may better reflect room temperature and non-crystalline water
arrangements. The density peaks can be used to infer water to
ligand-receptor bridging.

<p>
<p align="center"><img src="rism/oppa.png" alt="panel" /></p>
<blockquote>

density plotted at two iso-levels (solid = 3, mesh = 6).
</blockquote>
</p>

<h4>Application: Differentiate H-Bond Desolvation Penalty</h4>
<p>

In Figure&nbsp;7, the 3D-RISM computed <span class='LaTeX'>\(\Delta G_{binding}\)</span> is
plotted at two iso-levels (PDB code 3FKT).  These are positive
<span class='LaTeX'>\(\Delta G_{binding}\)</span> contributions which indicate regions where
desolvation is detrimental to binding.  The black mesh iso-level is 8
times larger (more positive) than the red iso-level. The iso-levels
indicate that there is a much larger penalty for desolvating H-bond partners
in the Phe128 region than in the Gln93 region.  The lower desolvation
penalty in the Gln93 region suggests that forming an H-bond here may
have a higher impact on affinity because less of the binding energy goes
to compensate for the desolvation penalty.

<p align="center"><img src="rism/bace_hbonds.png" alt="panel" /></p>

<blockquote>

iso-level is 8 times larger (more positive) than the red iso-level.
</blockquote>

<h4>Application: Characterizing Binding Sites</h4>
<p>

In Figure&nbsp;8(A), the 3D-RISM water O density (blue-mesh) and the
positive (red) and negative (green) contributions to
<span class='LaTeX'>\(\Delta G_{complex}\)</span>
are plotted in the S3 subpocket of renin (PDB
code 2IKO). This subpocket is left empty upon ligand binding,
leaving room for water molecules.  The water O density shows some water
localization in this subpocket, but the overall positive value of
<span class='LaTeX'>\(\Delta G_{complex}\)</span> indicates that the water localization is not
particularly stable. In Figure&nbsp;8(B), the 3D-RISM water O density
(solid-blue) and hydrophobe (mesh-orange) densities are compared in the
same renin S3 subpocket.  The fact that the hydrophobe distribution
(orange mesh) fills the S3 subpocket more completely than the water O
density, and that the positive <span class='LaTeX'>\(\Delta G_{complex}\)</span> indicates
unstable ordered waters in this pocket suggests that filling the pocket
with a hydrophobic group would be preferred.
Furthermore, such a group could be decorated with
H-bonding groups to take advantage of backbone donors responsible for
the two small negative <span class='LaTeX'>\(\Delta G_{complex}\)</span> regions (shown in
green in Figure&nbsp;8(A)).

</p>

<p align="center"><img src="rism/renin_sp3a.png" alt="panel" /></p>
<p align="center"><img src="rism/renin_sp3b.png" alt="panel" /></p>

<blockquote>

3D-RISM water O (solid-blue) and hydrophobe (mesh-orange) densities are
shown in the same renin S3 subpocket.

</blockquote>

<h4>Application: Highlighting Hydrophobic Sites</h4>
<p>

In Figure&nbsp;9, the receptor water O density (blue solid surface),
the positive <span class='LaTeX'>\(\Delta G_{receptor}\)</span> (solid red), and the negative
<span class='LaTeX'>\(\Delta G_{binding}\)</span> (green mesh) are shown in a hydrophobic
pocket of BACE (PDB code 3FKT). The positive
<span class='LaTeX'>\(\Delta G_{receptor}\)</span> around the localized water density indicates
that this water can be favorably displaced by a ligand. The negative
<span class='LaTeX'>\(\Delta G_{binding}\)</span> further confirms this by indicating
that desolvation will result in free energy gains.

</p>
<p align="center"><img src="rism/bace_p.png" alt="panel" /></p>

<blockquote>

pocket of BACE

</blockquote>

<h4>Application: Exploring Displaceable Waters</h4>

<p>

In Figure&nbsp;10, the 3D-RISM water O density (solid blue) has a peak in
a non-obvious region.  However, the <span class='LaTeX'>\(\Delta G_{complex}\)</span> solvation
free energy is close to zero at the location of this peak, suggesting it
might be interesting to try to displace a water in this region using a
small greasy substituent. The green R-vector highlighted in this picture
shows a potential point of substitution on the ligand.  This specific
strategy has been shown to increase significantly the activity of the
parent structure (shown) [McGhaughey&nbsp;2011].

</p>

<p align="center"><img src="rism/bace_w.png" alt="panel" /></p>
<p>
<blockquote>

to zero at the location of this peak.

</blockquote>
</p>

<h3>Advanced Considerations when Using 3D-RISM</h3>
<p>

There are several considerations that should be
taken into account when interpreting
3D-RISM results. Firstly, the equations are solved with respect
to a fixed geometry of the solute.
It is possible, for example, for a ligand to suffer from
an intra-molecular desolvation penalty if it is in a ligand bioactive
conformation. This situation cannot be detected by 3D-RISM.
The same is true for
the receptor that can often adopt a different arrangement in a bound
state.

<p>

The orientation of the polar hydrogen atoms of both the ligand and the
receptor may have an impact on the calculated solvent distributions.
When in doubt, one may want to repeat the 3D-RISM calculation with
different geometries.

</p>
<p>

In analyzing the results, it is important to always account for the
receptor-ligand interactions that are in direct competition with the
desolvation effects. 3D-RISM does not account for any direct
receptor-ligand interactions. H-bonds are obvious cases where the
desolvation penalty is large and compensated for by a strong polar
interaction energy. One can also find: water
proton-<span class='LaTeX'>\(\pi\)</span>,
cation-<span class='LaTeX'>\(\pi\)</span>,
attractive non-polar vdW interactions, salt bridges, etc.

</p>
<p>

Sometimes one may find strange water hydrogen density in places it
should, in principle, not be. This is due to actual limitations of
the method. The effect can be exacerbated close to negatively charged
groups found in aspartate or glutamate residues for instance.

</p>
<p>

The quantitative aspect was deliberately left out of the current 3D-RISM
implementation. Although we have found ways to improve 3D-RISM in this regard,
more research is needed.

<td valign="top"><b>Salt</b></td>
<td valign="top">
The concentration of salt (NaCl ions) in the solvent. The presence of salt
reduces the effects of formally charged systems and adds robustness to the
results. The calculation time and memory requirements
will increase with the use of salt.  Separate anion and cation 3D density
maps will be generated.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Hydrophobe</b></td>
<td valign="top">
The concentration of a given hydrophobe in the solvent (a Lennard-Jones
particle).  The hydrophobe will be correlated with solvent and salt atoms.
The calculation time and memory requirements will increase with the use
of a hydrophobe.  A separate hydrophobic 3D density map will be generated.
Note that in this map the
hydrophobe distribution does not represent hydrophobic regions, but rather
where a probe of the size of a neutral Cl atom could better interact with the
solute.

Press <b>3D-RISM</b> to change various options that affect the underlying
3D-RISM calculation.  Normally, the defaults should be used; however,
changes are reasonable if memory requirements are prohibitively large or
if very approximate (fast) calculations are desired.
<ul>
<p><li>Grid Spacing. The dimensions of each grid cell (<span class='LaTeX'>\(\mathring A\)</span>).
Smaller values provide better results but use more memory.
</li></p>
<p><li>Buffer. The distance (<span class='LaTeX'>\(\mathring A\)</span>) by which the bounding box
of atoms is extended.  Two solvation shells is sufficient.
</li></p>
<p><li>Convergence. The precision at which the 3D-RISM equations
are solved: Loose (approximate), Medium or Tight (very accurate).
</li></p>
<p><li>NDIIS. In the DIIS (Direct Inversion in the Iterative Subspace)
method, the number
of copies (N) of the various 3D grids retained in memory for accelerating
convergence by extrapolation.
Smaller values use less memory but slow down the convergence rate.

<td valign="top"><b>Options</b></td>
<td valign="top">
Options to control various aspects of the Solvent Analysis calculation:
<ul>
<p><li><b>Calculate Partial Charges</b>.
If on, then the AM1-BCC partial charges will be used on the small molecule
ligand and AMBER10 on the rest of the system. This does not change the
current partial charges of the system. Otherwise,
the existing partial charges will be used as-is.
</li></p>
<p><li><b>Simultaneous Run</b>. If on, then the various grids for the
complex, receptor and ligand will be calculated in parallel; however,
more computer resources will be required.  This option is only applicable
to a Binding calculation.

<td valign="top"><b>Message</b></td>
<td valign="top">
The text line at the bottom gives an estimate of the memory
that will be used at
the peak of the calculation. When performing a simultaneous run on a binding
calculation, the estimated memory sums the requirements of the three
calculations. Many fields affect the memory: the system size <b>Within</b>,
the presence or not of <b>Salt</b> and <b>Hydrophobe</b> and all the
<b>3D-RISM</b> options except the Convergence criteria. The text also
reports the stage of the calculation when creating
the input file; the input file is created when
<b>Run</b> or <b>Batch</b> is pressed.

<p>
Press <b>Run</b> to
begin the calculation.  Progress will be displayed in the MOE Window. The
panel will close. The calculation time depends on the size and complexity
of the system as well as whether Binding or Solute is selected.  Typically,
several minutes are required for a protein:ligand complex. Once the
calculations are ongoing, they can be terminated using
<b>MOE | Cancel | rism3d</b>. To defer the run,
press <b>Batch</b>. A file named using the file prefix specified
in the <b>Filename</b> textfield, e.g. <tt>rism3d_rism.svl</tt>
if <tt>rism3d</tt> is specified, is written containing all the
instructions and data, including the input file,
needed for a solvent analysis calculation.
This file is standalone and
can be run using moebatch. Running instructions are printed on the CLI.
Press <b>Close</b> to close the panel.
</p>

<p>
The batch file can be run either inside MOE or
independently in a shell.
In MOE, the file is run from a MOE CLI
by typing
</p>

<pre>
    run 'rism3d_rism.svl'
</pre>

<p>
In a shell, the file is run using:
</p>

<pre>
    % moebatch -run rism3d_rism.svl -p <i>outputpath</i> -m <i>[0|1]</i>
</pre>

where the <tt>-p</tt> option specifies the directory (path) in which
to write the output file.  This is useful if the
the output file is to be saved to
a directory different than the current working directory or
&quot;working folder&quot; (default). The <tt>-m</tt>
option specifies if the calculations are to be simultaneous (<tt>-m 0</tt>)
or not (<tt>-m 1</tt>).
When not specified, the default running mode is determined by the
state of the <b>Simultaneous Run</b> checkbox
when the batch file as created.

<td valign="top"><b>Complex<br />Receptor<br />Ligand<br />Binding</b></td>
<td valign="top">
The 3D grid data contours are controlled by a matrix of buttons.
Each row of the matrix corresponds to Complex, Receptor, Ligand or
Binding data.  Each column of the matrix contains a single type of grid:
<span class='LaTeX'>\(\Delta G\)</span>, Water Occupancy, Salt Occupancy or Hydrophobe Occupancy.
If a matrix element is not associated with data from the <tt>.rism</tt> files
then it is disabled; otherwise it appears as dark gray (for hidden) or
colored (for shown).  Click a matrix button to toggle on or off the display of
iso-contours of a particular 3D map (e.g. Receptor <span class='LaTeX'>\(\Delta G\)</span>).
</p>
<p>
Right-click on a particular matrix button to raise a popup control panel
that allows one to change the contour iso-levels, surface color and
material properties, etc.
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="rism/popup_a.png" alt="panel" /></p>
<p>
In the case of maps that correspond to two items (e.g., H and O in water,
&lt;0 and &gt;0 in <span class='LaTeX'>\(\Delta G\)</span>, etc.)
then each of the items may be separately
controlled and the two colors are displayed in the matrix button. The density
iso-level value is relative to bulk density; a value of 4 means four fold denser
than bulk. In the popups related to the free energy maps for ligand, receptor
and complex, the iso-levels are in units of
kcal/mol/<span class='LaTeX'>\(\mathring A\)</span><sup>3</sup>.

<td valign="top">
The iso-contour surfaces will be restricted to display information within
the specified distance (<span class='LaTeX'>\(\mathring A\)</span>)

<b>Note!</b> Typically, a Solvent Analysis calculation is inherently
