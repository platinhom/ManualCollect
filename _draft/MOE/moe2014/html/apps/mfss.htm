<!-- OVERVIEW -->

<a name="Overview"></a>
<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
The purpose of MultiFragment Search (MFS) is to help understand the
interactions between chemical functional groups (referred to as fragments)
with the active site of a receptor.  MFS uses a 3D structural model of the
receptor, making it a structure-based ligand design methodology.
Structure-based design is a term used to describe the design of an active
ligand from scratch (<i>de novo</i> design) or the improvement of a known
(structurally) active ligand.  This document describes the individual
steps of MFS as well as its input and output.

<p>
The fundamental idea behind MultiFragment Search is to place a relatively
large number of copies of a fragment, say 200 copies of ethane, into the
receptor's active site.  
The fragments are placed randomly around the
active site atoms and are assumed not to interact with each
other; no regard is paid to fragment overlap.  Next, a special energy
minimization protocol is used to refine the initial placement: the receptor
atoms feel the <i>average forces</i> of the fragments, while each fragment
feels the <i>full force</i> of the receptor but not of the other fragments. 

<p><center>

Energy Minimization of Fragments in the Active Site of a Receptor">
</center>

<p>
The above diagram depicts the energy minimization of a collection of
fragments (represented as white discs) inside the active site of a
receptor (blue region).  In a real calculation, more than one type of
fragment would be used; for example, 200 copies of ethane, 200 copies of
water and 200 copies of dimethylsulfone.  Even though more than one
fragment class is used, the basic principle remains the same.  The flow of
operations of MultiFragment Search is depicted below (it is assumed that
the molecular system currently loaded in MOE is the receptor and that the
atoms of the active site are selected):

<p>
<center>
<img src="mfss/flow.jpg" height=307 width=394
    alt="Flow of Operations of the MultiFragment Search">
</center>

<p>
Processing begins by saving the original molecular system into the file
<tt>mfss_orgsys.moe</tt>.  This is done because the molecular system will be
heavily processed and modified.  Next, many (potentially tens of thousands)
small molecular fragments are randomly placed around the active site atoms.
The initial placement of the fragments together with the receptor will be saved
as <tt>mfss_orgcop.moe</tt> (the original copies).  The final preparatory step
is to fix most or all of the receptor, i.e. constrain the receptor so
that no movement is possible.  This is done for reasons of computational
efficiency and also to prevent gross motion of the receptor's atoms.

<p>
After preparation, the calculation begins.  In turn, each of
the fragment classes (i.e. all chemically identical fragments) are
energy minimized, while the other fragments and the receptor are held fixed.
During this energy minimization, fragments interact only with the receptor
and not with any other fragments.  This is followed by the energy
minimization of the receptor atoms with the fragment atoms held fixed.
The receptor is subjected to the mean force of the fragments.  This energy
minimization protocol is repeated until convergence within a user-defined
RMS gradient.

<p>
Once the receptor and fragment atoms have converged, fragment copies are
deleted, leaving only uniquely placed fragments. If the positions of two
chemically identical fragments are within the RMSD tolerance specified by the 
Copies RMSD parameter, one of the copies is deleted.  
The resulting unique fragments and receptor are saved to the
file <tt>mfss_mincop.moe</tt> (the minimized copies).  Next, the
individual fragments are written out to the molecular database called
<tt>mfss_output.mdb</tt> along with interaction energy information.  Once
written to the database, the fragments are deleted from the MOE system.
The resulting minimized receptor (without fragments) is saved as
<tt>mfss_minrec.moe</tt> which completes the calculation.

<p>
The most important output files are the minimized receptor 
(<tt>mfss_minrec.moe</tt>) and the fragment
database containing the interaction energies (<tt>mfss_output.mdb</tt>).
These fragments may be inspected in order to identify those fragments and
conformations that exhibit the best binding energies.  In this way, a
collection of "preferred" functional groups can be calculated for a
particular receptor.

<a name="Running"></a>
<h2>Running MultiFragment Search</h2>

<p>
To start MultiFragment Search, perform the following steps:

<ol>
<li>Load a receptor molecule into MOE.  This receptor <b>must</b> be
prepared for MultiFragment Search by adding all hydrogens and calculating
suitable partial charges. If necessary, minimize the energy of the 
receptor atoms.
<p>
<li>Configure the forcefield.  Use the Potential Setup panel to
choose an appropriate forcefield for receptor-ligand interactions.  MMFF94
is a reasonable choice.  Decide if the solvation term will be used in
the energy minimization; using it will significantly slow down the
calculation.  Also, decide on the use of non-bonded cutoffs and choose
a dielectric constant.
<p>
<li>Select the atoms of the active site.  This step is necessary if
fragments are to be generated.  Try to pick only the solvent exposed
atoms of the active site (to improve the speed of fragment generation).
<p>
<li>Choose 
<span class="nobr"><b>Compute | Fragments | MultiFragment Search</b></span>
in the MOE Window to open the MultiFragment Search panel.
</ol>

<p>
The MultiFragment Search panel
consists of a number of pages, each of which describes or configures a
portion of the MultiFragment Search procedure.  These pages are described
below.

<h4>Step 1: Fragment Generation</h4>

<p>
The Ligand Fragments page allows you to specify the fragments to generate
around the active site atoms of the receptor.  The list of available
fragments is read from a molecular database file and is displayed in the
page.  The default collection of fragments is described below.  You can
add more fragments by creating your own fragment database and specifying
it in the Fragments field of the page.

<p><center>
<img src="mfss/pgfrag.png" alt="Ligand Fragments Page">
</center>

<p>

<table border="0" width="100%" cellpadding="5">
<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Fragments</b>
<td valign="top">Name of the molecular database file containing the
fragments displayed in the list.  To load a different list, enter the
filename in the text field and press the Load button.

</tr><tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Copies</b>
<td valign="top">Number of copies of each fragment to generate.  For each
fragment selected in the list, an attempt will be made to generate the given
number of copies.  In some cases, less copies will result due to steric
clashes.
</tr><tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Copies&nbsp;RMSD</b>
<td valign="top">
Two chemically identical fragments will be considered to be in the same
position if the Root Mean Square Distance of their coordinates is less than
the given value.  This duplicate test applies to initial fragment generation
as well as to post-minimization duplicate removal.
</tr><tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Fragment&nbsp;List</b>
<td valign="top">
Select the fragments to generate from the list.  The list displays the
name of the fragment, its class (residue name) and a string representing its
chemical formula.  <b>Note:</b> If no fragments are selected, none will be
generated.  Also, generated fragments are placed in the vicinity of 
selected atoms in the MOE window. Thus, the receptor atoms around the
binding pocket must be selected for fragments to be placed.
</tr>
</table>

<p>
Press the <b>Next</b> button to proceed to the next page.

<h4>Step 2: Energy Minimization Parameters</h4>


<p>
Fundamentally, the MFS calculation is that of repeated energy minimization.
Although the receptor and fragment class atoms are minimized in turn, each
energy minimization step will terminate when the <b>Root Mean Square (RMS)
Gradient</b> falls below a given threshold.  At the default level of 0.01,
the coordinates of fragments are such that a comparison for duplicates
can be effected with very little chance that the resulting cluster will
diverge with subsequent minimization.  The RMS gradient is set on the
Minimization Options page depicted below.

<p>
<center>
<img src="mfss/pgmin.png" alt="Minimization Options Page">
</center>

<p>
The <b>Belly Distance</b> controls the extent to which the receptor
atoms will be frozen at their initial positions.  For each atom <i>i</i> in
the receptor, let <i>d<sub>i</sub></i> denote the distance to the closest
atom in any fragment.  Receptor atom <i>i</i> will be held fixed if
<i>d<sub>i</sub></i> is greater than or equal to the given Belly Distance.
If the value of Belly Distance is zero, all atoms in the receptor will
be held fixed for the duration of the calculation.  If the Belly Distance
is, say, 10, then all receptor atoms farther than 10 angstroms 
from a fragment
atom will be held fixed while closer receptor atoms will be allowed to move.

<p>
Press the <b>Next</b> button to proceed to the next page.


<h4>Step 3: Assigning Output Files</h4>

<p>
The Start Simulation page contains text fields for specifying the names
of the output files.  

<p><center>
<img src="mfss/pgfile.png" alt="Start Simulation Page">
</center>

<p>
All MFS output files begin with a common prefix; the default is <tt>mfss</tt>.
You can either leave the default prefix as is or supply a new one.  This prefix
will be prepended to each of the subsequent files in the page.  The output
files are (along with their default values):

<p>
<center><table class="titlebar">

<td valign="top"><i>prefix</i><tt>_log.txt</tt>
<td valign="top">

</tr>
</table></center>

<h4>Starting the Calculation</h4>

<p>
Finally, press the <b>Start</b> button to begin the MFS calculation. Depending
on the size of the receptor and the number of fragments around the active
site atoms, the MFS calculation may take up to several hours to complete.
When done, the specified output files will be available for analysis.


<!-- ANALYZING -->

<a name="Analyzing"></a>
<h2>Analyzing the Output</h2>

<p>
The primary output of the MultiFragment Search is the fragment database
(by default, <tt>mfss_output.mdb</tt>).  This database contains the unique
chemical fragments at the end of the energy minimization.  For each
fragment, individual fragment-receptor interaction energies are calculated
and stored.  The following fields are stored in the database:

<table border="0" cellpadding="5">
<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>mol</b>
<td valign="top">Fragment structure and coordinates.
</tr></tr>
<td valign="top"><b>name</b>
<td valign="top">Name of the fragment.
</tr></tr>
<td valign="top"><b>dU</b>
<td valign="top">Interaction potential (without solvent model) calculated
as <nobr>U(complex) - U(receptor) - U(fragment)</nobr>.  All other fragments are ignored.
Values are in kcal/mol.
</tr></tr>
<td valign="top"><b>dE</b>
<td valign="top">Interaction energy (with solvent model) calculated
as <nobr>E(complex) - E(receptor) - E(fragment)</nobr>.  All other fragments are ignored.
Values are in kcal/mol.
</tr></tr>
<td valign="top"><b>dU(class)</b>
<td valign="top">Value of dU for each fragment minus the minimum dU taken
over all chemically identical fragments.
Values are in kcal/mol.
</tr></tr>
<td valign="top"><b>dE(class)</b>
<td valign="top">Value of dE for each fragment minus the minimum dE taken
over all chemically identical fragments.
Values are in kcal/mol.
</tr>
</table>

<p>
The Database Viewer sort facility <nobr><b>(Compute | Sort)</b></nobr> can be used to
select fragments.  By sorting on different energy fields, different selection
criteria can be used:

<ul>
<li><b>Best binding:</b>  Sort Up on the dE field to bring to the top of the
database the fragments with the best overall binding energy (including
solvation effects).
<p>
<li><b>Lowest potential:</b>  Sort Up on the dU field to bring to the top
of the database the fragments with the lowest interaction potential energy
(ignoring solvation effects).
<p>
<li><b>Best binding in fragment class:</b>  Sort Up on the dE(class) to bring to
the top of the database the best binding fragments (including solvation effects)
within each fragment class.  <b>Note:</b> The best in each class will have a
dE(class) value of zero.
<p>
<li><b>Lowest potential in fragment class:</b>  Sort Up on the dU(class)
to bring to the top of the database the fragments with the lowest
interaction potential (ignoring solvation effects) within each fragment
class.  <b>Note:</b> The best in each class will have a dU(class) value of
zero.

</ul>

<p>
The Browser in the Database Viewer <nobr><b>(File | Browse...)</b></nobr> can be
used to step through each of the output fragments.  If the receptor atoms
are still loaded, each fragment will be placed in the receptor context.

<!-- CREATING A FRAGMENT LIBRARY -->

<a name="NewFragLib"></a>
<h2>Creating a Fragment Library</h2>

<p>
MultiFragment Search uses a precalculated fragment library to populate a
receptor with fragment copies.  In principle, any molecular structure can
be used as a fragment; however, small rigid units are best (otherwise,
multiple conformations should be put into the fragment library).  Perform
the following steps to create a new fragment library.

<ol>
<li>Create a new molecular database with <b>File&nbsp;|&nbsp;New | Database</b>.
<p>
<li>In the Database Viewer, use <b>Edit&nbsp;|&nbsp;New&nbsp;|&nbsp;Field...</b> to create four database fields: 
<br><b>mol</b> of type molecule
<br><b>name</b> of type char
<br><b>formula</b> of type char
<br><b>rname</b> of type char

<p>
<li>Use <nobr><b>Edit | New | Entry</b></nobr> to add an entry to the database for each fragment structure.  

<p>The fragment structure should be built in the MOE Window
and energy minimized.  Make sure that partial charges have been calculated
for each atom because MultiFragment Search does not calculate fragment
charges.  Put the full name of the fragment in the Header field of the
chain (use the Atom Manager).  Make sure that the fragment has a single
residue name and give it a reasonable three-letter code.

</ol>

<p>
Once the library has been created, it can be specified in the MultiFragment
Search panel and loaded.

<!-- DEFAULT FRAGMENT LIBRARY -->

<a name="DefFragLib"></a>
<h2>Default Fragment Library</h2>

<p>
The MOE installation provides a default fragment library for use with
MultiFragment Search.  The file is located in <tt>$MOE/lib/mfssfrag.mdb</tt>
and contains the following molecular fragments:
