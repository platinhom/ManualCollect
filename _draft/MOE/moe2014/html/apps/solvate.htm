<p>
The purpose of the Solvate application is to add solvent molecules to a
molecular system, typically prior to a molecular dynamics simulation.
The Solvate application provides for:

<ol>
<li>Centering and axis aligning the solute.
<li>Selection of solvent: water, DMSO, methanol, carbon tetrachloride.
<li>Addition of solvent molecules to a solute or to an empty system.
<li>Support for periodic (cell) or aperiodic (droplet) systems.
<li>Configuration of Crystal Parameters or Wall Restraint.
</ol>

<p>
Solvate adds solvent by replicating precalculated periodic systems of
molecules so as to envelop a solute.
Solvent molecules that clash with the solute are eliminated.  Solvent molecules
farther away from the solute
are removed to produce a droplet or periodic cell of a specified size.
An optional additional margin of solvent depth can be added.
The resulting molecular system, which will not contain large strain energies,
is briefly minimized to remove the remaining strain.
For periodic systems, fine tuning of the cell volume is best conducted with
<a href="md.htm">NPT molecular dynamics</a>
with careful attention to the protocol.
</p>

<!-- METHODS -->

<a name="Methods"></a>
<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>
Solvent molecules are added to the current molecular system using
the following steps:

<ol>
<li><b>Delete</b>.
Optionally, distant (no atom less than 4.0&nbsp;&Aring; from the solute) or all
of the existing solvent molecules currently in the system are deleted
prior to solvation.
Compounds selected via
<b>MOE&nbsp;|&nbsp;Select&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="../moe/gui/mainwin.htm#Solvent">Solvent</a></b>
are candidates to be removed in this step.
<p>
<li><b>Transform</b>.
Optionally, the atoms in the current system are transformed
by a rigid body rotation and translation so that the solute center of mass
is at the origin and principal mass moments are aligned to the
<i>x</i>-, <i>y</i>- and <i>z</i>-axes.  Note that <i>all</i>
atoms in the system will be affected.
<p>
<li><b>Neutralize</b>.
Optionally, salt counterions are added to neutralize the system.  The
smallest number of counterions are added to achieve neutrality; they are
placed sequentially at optimal locations.
<p>
<li><b>Read Solvent</b>.
One of the precalculated periodic solvent files in <tt>$MOE/lib/solvent</tt>
is read and replicated so as to surround all of the atoms in the system
plus a specified margin.  The precalculated files were prepared by performing
molecular dynamics simulations at experimental density.
<p>
<li><b>Remove Clashes</b>.
Solvent molecules that clash with atoms in the system are deleted as are
solvent molecules outside the droplet or solvent layer (if specified).
If the system is periodic, certain solvent molecules are removed to
reduce clashes due to periodicity (see below).
<p>
<li><b>Update Parameters</b>.
Optionally, update the Crystal Parameters (for periodic systems) or
the Wall Restraint (for droplets) to reflect the solvated geometry:
sphere, ellipse, box, cube, etc.
</ol>

<p>
Retaining pre-existing solvent molecules is useful when counterions have
already been positioned or to retain crystallographic waters found in PDB
files.  The 4.0&nbsp;&Aring; cutoff used for the &quot;nearby&quot; test
is consistent with the first layer contact statistics &ndash; water molecules
beyond the cutoff are unlikely to be bound waters.  The rigid body
transformation in the Transform step aligns the eigenvalues of the
mass-weighted covariance matrix of the solute atoms with the canonical axes.
Typically, such a transformation is used to position a small molecule at
the center of a droplet which is itself centered at the origin or to
position a molecular system at the center of a periodic cell.
<b>Note!</b> Atom tether parameters are transformed along with the atoms
and fixed atoms are temporarily unfixed and re-fixed after the transformation.

<p>
Solvent files are pre-calculated periodic systems of solvent molecules.  The
file format is a modified SD file.  The first line marks the file as a
solvent file and is followed by
an SD file record that ends with <tt>$$$$</tt>.  The record consists of a
connection table, which defines a single solvent molecule using 2D depiction
coordinates, followed by data fields of which four are specific to the
solvent format.  These fields define the solvent name, SMARTS
pattern and periodic cell parameters along with the total molecule count
in the 3D coordinate data.
The 3D Coordinate data, provided for all the solvent molecules
in the periodic system, follow the
<tt>$$$$</tt>.
</p>

<p>
The optional SMARTS pattern is
used to delete pre-existing copies of the solvent
molecule.  The pattern does not need to include
light atoms as
the Solvate application will automatically delete any attached
light atoms.

<p>
The solvents available to the Solvate graphical user interface
are those specified by solvent files
in the <tt>$MOE/lib/solvent</tt> directory.  The
<a class="svl" href="../moe/fcnref/solvfcn.htm">Solvate</a> function
further allows specification of
a solvent file located elsewhere than in <tt>$MOE/lib/solvent</tt>.

<p>
After replication of the solvent periodic system, some solvent molecules
may clash with the solute.
In periodic systems, additional clashes may arise if the pre-calculated
periodic cell does not evenly divide the desired periodic cell, in which
case some solvent molecules may clash with other solvent molecules
due to the change in periodicity conditions.
All such offending molecules are eliminated.  Likewise,
candidate solvent molecules outside the droplet
or solute layer dimensions are removed, as are
any solvent molecules that violate droplet
geometry (this applies to aperiodic systems only).
</p>

<p>Solvent molecules that clash with either solute or (in periodic
systems) other solvent molecules
are identified by applying an energetic clash test
parameterized by a strain energy cutoff <i>C</i>, typically
10&ndash;20&nbsp;kcal/mol.  The interaction energy
between two molecules (whether solvent or solute) is the sum of the
Coulomb and van der Waals energies.  In
periodic systems, this interaction energy
is calculated between each pair of candidate solvent molecules under
the contemplated periodic boundary conditions rather than the pre-calculated
periodic boundary conditions.
Any candidate solvent molecule that
has a total interaction energy with the rest of the system greater
than <i>C</i> is removed.
</p>

<p>Formally,
let <b>U</b>&nbsp;=&nbsp;[<i>U<sub>ij</sub></i>] denote the matrix
of molecular interaction energies between solvent molecules
<i>i</i> and <i>j</i>.
Let <b>u</b>&nbsp;=&nbsp;(<i>u<sub>i</sub></i>) denote the vector of
interaction energies between solvent molecules <i>i</i> and the solute.
Let <b>x</b> be a binary vector with a 1 indicating that a particular
solvent molecule is to be included and 0 indicating that the molecule is
to be removed.  For a particular vector, <b>x</b>, we define the total
system energy to be

<p align=center>
<i>E</i>(<b>x</b>) =
      <b>x</b><sup>T</sup> <b>U</b> <b>x</b> / 2
    + <b>u</b><sup>T</sup> <b>x</b>
    + <i>C</i> <b>e</b><sup>T</sup> (<b>e</b> &ndash; <b>x</b>)
</p>

<p>
where <b>e</b> denotes a vector of all 1 values.  This total energy function 
is such that if a solvent molecule is removed
(<i>x<sub>i</sub></i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0) then an energy penalty of <i>C</i>
is paid.  Thus, in order for a candidate solvent molecule to be removed,
its interaction energy with the rest of the system will have to be greater
than <i>C</i>.  Minimization of <i>E</i> over all binary vectors <b>x</b>
will result in the optimal removal of solvent molecules that cause too
much strain were they to be included.  This combinatorial optimization
is conducted using an iterative Dead End Elimination algorithm.

<h2>Running the Application</h2>

<p>
To start Solvate, select <nobr><b>MOE | Edit | Solvate</b></nobr>;
however, before running Solvate, ensure that the molecular system is
topologically correct; i.e. it has proper ionization states, no missing atoms,
etc.  Solvate will add missing hydrogens according to the topology of the
system but ionization state will not be changed. It is recommended that
<a href="protonate3d.htm">Protonate3D</a>
be run prior to solvating the system to perform the protonation and
ionization state assignment.
</p>

<p><center><img SRC="solvate/panel.png" alt="Solvate Panel"></center>

<p><table cellspacing=5>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Mode</b>
<td valign="top">
Specifies the fundamental geometry type of the solvated system.
<b>Droplet</b> will
create an aperiodic system with ellipsoidal or rectilinear boundary
conditions.  <b>Layer</b> will create solvent in a layer
that coats the solute.  <b>Periodic</b>
will create a P1 rectilinear periodic system with 90&deg; cell angles.
In all cases (except when using Crystal Parameters or Wall Restraint
dimensions), the depth of the solvent surrounding the solute is
specified by <b>Margin</b>.
<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Shape</b>
<td valign="top">
Specifies the particular geometry of the solvated system,
depending on the specified <b>Mode</b>.
In Droplet Mode, the shapes
can be <b>Sphere</b>, <b>Ellipse</b>, <b>Cube</b>, <b>Box</b>
(bounding box) or <b>Wall</b>.  Wall uses the current dimensions of the
Wall Restraints in the
<a href="../moe/pot.htm#Wall">Potential Setup</a> panel.
In Layer Mode, the shape options are disabled as
the solvent follows the contours
of the solute.  In Periodic Mode, the shape can be one of
<b>Cube</b>, <b>Box</b> or <b>Crystal</b>.  Box uses the current
settings of the
<a href="crystal.htm">Crystal Parameters</a> unit cell.
<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Solvent</b>
<td valign="top">
Specifies the solvent molecule.  The solvent systems are pre-calculated
periodic systems of solvent specified in solvent files found
in the <tt>$MOE/lib/solvent</tt> directory.  A 2D
depiction of the selected solvent is displayed, along with the residue name of
the solvent.
<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Salt</b>
<td valign="top">
Specifies the salt used to neutralize charged systems.  Enter the chemical
formula of the salt; e.g. NaCl, or KCl.  Only salts with monatomic ions
are permitted.  The salt is ignored for neutral systems.
<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Margin</b>
<td valign="top">
Solvent is added to the system to surround the specified solute atoms to
a depth specified by <b>Margin</b>.  Except when Wall Restraints or
Crystal Parameters are being used (in which case this value is
ignored), this setting affects
the ultimate size of the periodic box or droplet.
For periodic systems, it is recommended that this value be set to
half of the Potential <a href="../moe/pot.htm#Cutoff">non-bonded cutoff</a>
plus one (i.e. the &quot;off&quot; cutoff value plus one).
In the case of Cube or Sphere geometries, the largest solute dimension is
used to set the Cube or Sphere size; in other cases, each axis will be given
its own dimension according to the solute dimensions along each axis.  For
example, if the largest dimension of the solute is 12&nbsp;&Aring; and the
value of <b>Margin</b> is 5&nbsp;&Aring; then a droplet of radius
12&nbsp;+&nbsp;5&nbsp;&Aring; or a periodic cube with
edge length 12&nbsp;+&nbsp;10&nbsp;&Aring; will be created.
<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Delete</b>
<td valign="top">
Specifies how to treat existing solvent in the system.  <b>Keep All</b> will
delete nothing; <b>Delete All</b> will delete all existing solvent;
<b>Delete Far</b> will delete all existing solvent with
minimum interatomic solute distance greater
than 4.0&nbsp;&Aring;.  <b>Note!</b> Candidates for deletion are atoms
identified by <span class="menu">MOE | Select |
<a href="../moe/gui/mainwin.htm#Solvent">Solvent</a></span>,
which may include
molecules other than that specified by the <b>Solvent</b> setting.
<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Solute</b>
<td valign="top">
Specifies the solute atoms:  <b>All</b> means all atoms, <b>Selected</b>
means selected atoms and <b>Ligand</b> means atoms identified by
<span class="menu">MOE | Select |
<a href="../moe/gui/mainwin.htm#Ligand">Ligand</a></span>.
The solute atoms are
used to determine centering and orientation (see below).  Droplet dimensions
are determined from the solute atoms only;
periodic systems, however,
are always fully solvated: <i>all</i> atoms in the
system are solvated whether or not they are specified as the solute.
<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Center<br>Axis&nbsp;Align</b>
<td valign="top">
If on then the <i>entire system</i> is translated and/or rotated (including
any atom tethers) so that the <b>Solute</b> center of mass is at the origin
and the principal mass moments are aligned to the <i>x-</i>, <i>y-</i>,
<i>z-</i>axes.  Atoms are temporarily unfixed and re-fixed, consequently,
fixed atoms are transformed as well.  Typically, these options are used
for periodic systems to center the solute at the cell origin and to reduce
the volume of the periodic cell.
<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Potential</b>
<td valign="top">
If on, then the Wall Restraint parameters (for Droplet solvations) or the
Crystal Parameters (for Periodic solvations) will be updated to reflect
the new system geometry.  This option has no effect when the Shape is
Wall (Droplet Mode) or Crystal (Periodic Mode).
