<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Flat graphics objects consist of device-independent 2D drawing primitives,
which can be created and manipulated by SVL programs. Such objects can be
owned and displayed by widgets, printed, previewed on screen, or output to
bitmap or vector file formats. They can also be serialized and deserialized, as
well as written to files or byte streams in their own format. There is no need
for any immediate display context, and flat graphic objects can be created and
handled in batch as well as in interactive applications.
</p>

<p>A flat graphics object is defined in terms that enable it to be rendered on
a number of different devices. Each supported device has its own rendering
engine which is charged with the task of representing the graphics primitives
as accurately as possible. Such devices include, but are not necessarily
limited to: X-window graphics (Unix and Linux), Microsoft GDI (Windows, screen
and printer), PostScript (all platforms), raster bitmap formats (such as PNG,
GIF, JPG, etc.) and potentially other formats which may be added in future
releases.
</p>

<p>Objects can be created without any foreknowledge of the devices on which
they will be rendered, and so very few assumptions about the nature of the
device are necessary. It is simple to generate a flat graphical object which is
suitable for displaying on the screen, encapsulating in a widget, printing on a
sheet of paper, and/or embedding in a document using a third-party application.
</p>

<p>The object itself consists of a header which contains layout hints (such as
size and units), and a list of <i>primitives</i> (such as lines, boxes, circles,
etc.) which make up the graphics content.
</p>

<p>There are three main ways in which flat graphics objects are used once they
are created and the desired primitives have been drawn into it:
</p>

<ol>

<li>A one-way output device is selected (such as a printer or a foreign file
format), and the object is transmitted to the appropriate rendering engine,
then discarded;
</li>

<li>The object is handed over to a widget, which takes over its management,
displaying while active, and destroying once finished;
</li>

<li>The object is serialized and stored in a byte stream (such as a file), for
later retrieval.
</li>

</ol>

<h4>Object Management</h4>

<p><a name="gr_create"></a></p>
<p><hr noshade /></p>

<pre>
key = <span class="fcndef">gr_create</span>
header key = <span class="fcndef">gr_create</span> key
</pre>

<p>The <tt>gr_create</tt> function creates or duplicates a flat graphics
object. Both syntaxes return a numeric key which subsequently is used to
refer to this object.  When the object is no longer needed, the key should be
destroyed using <a class="svl" href="#gr_destroy"><tt>gr_destroy</tt></a>.
Every call to <tt>gr_create</tt> should be paired with a call to
<tt>gr_destroy</tt>.

</p>

<pre>
    svl&gt; key = gr_create [
        title: 'diagram',
        size: [100, 100],
        units: 'pt'
    ];
</pre>

<p>The above code creates a new graphics object using the provided tagged
vector as the <i>header</i>. A newly assigned <tt>key</tt> is returned.

<pre>
    svl&gt; dup_key = gr_create orig_key;
</pre>

<p>This invocation makes a duplicate of the first key and returns the
duplicate.  The two keys <tt>dup_key</tt> and <tt>orig_key</tt> are two
distinct references to the same object.  Any changes made to the object
using one key can be seen from the other.  The two keys must be destroyed
separately, as they can have different lifecycles.  The object remains
in existence as long as there are keys associated with it.  Once a key is
destroyed, it becomes invalid and must not be used again, even though the
object might still exist (owing to the presence of other valid keys that
refer to it).

</p>

<p>The following header tags are explicitly recognized:
</p>

<blockquote>

<dl>

<dt><tt>size</tt></dt>

<dd>Vector of two numbers, defining the width and height, in
units specified by the <tt>units</tt> tag.
</dd>

<dt><tt>units</tt></dt>

<dd>Token indicating the positional units. Must be either
<tt>'pt'</tt> or <tt>'pix'</tt>.
</dd>

<dt><tt>opacity</tt></dt>

<dd>Solid color background to use when rendering the object;
default is no background.
</dd>

</dl></blockquote>

<p>All tags within a header are technically optional, but a flat graphical
object cannot be expected to be rendered well without <tt>size</tt> and
<tt>units</tt>. Specification of <tt>size</tt> is in the form of <tt>[ width,
height ]</tt>; the origin is <i>always</i> at zero. The numbers given for the
size should be considered to be the smallest possible device unit larger than
the actual number, for instance if the dimensions were rendered as pixels
without scaling, the domain of the object would be x in [0 to 99], y in [0 to
99], if the graphics object were to be rendered onto a device where a logical
unit equates to a single pixel.

</p>

<p>There are only two <tt>units</tt> available, and the value must be one
of <tt>'pix'</tt> or <tt>'pt'</tt>. The former is device-specific, and is
recommended only for specific uses such as objects which will only be used
to display within widgets or be rendered into bitmaps. The preferred units
for scalable, device-independent graphics is the point (<tt>'pt'</tt>),
which is defined at the time of rendering. For screen-displayed objects,
the mapping between points and pixels is tied to the definition of font
sizes. For example, on a contemporary screen where a "12-point" font is
drawn 12 pixels high, the mapping between points and pixels is 1:1; on a
high-resolution screen where a "12-point" font is drawn 24 pixels high,
the mapping would be 1:2.

</p>

<p>For printers and printer-like devices, a point is defined specifically as
1/72th of an inch. External vector formats use the printer units as a baseline
size, but can be expected to be scaled by later applications during viewing or
prior to final output.

</p>

<p>By default a graphics object has no background. When it is rendered to an
output device, it will be drawn overlaid upon anything that may have been drawn
underneath it. This may be changed by setting the <tt>opacity</tt> header option
to a specific color. If a solid color is specified, the boundaries of the object
will be filled prior to rendering. A fully transparent color may be specified as
-1, or a mask of 0xFF000000, which is equivalent to no background. The effect of
partial transparency is undefined.

</p>

<p>Other than these, a header can consist of any number of options, which must
be specified as scalar tokens, and may be interpreted by certain rendering
devices. In the example given earlier, a <tt>title</tt> was given, which is
considered meta-information.

</p>

<p><a name="gr_destroy"></a></p>
<p><hr noshade /></p>
    
<a name="gr_destroy" id="gr_destroy"></a>
<pre>
<span class="fcndef">gr_destroy</span> key
</pre>

<p>Destroys or de-references a key. Every call to <tt>gr_create</tt>
should have a corresponding call to <tt>gr_destroy</tt>, otherwise keys
will last for the duration of the SVL task. Memory devoted to a graphics
object will be freed only when the total reference count (number of valid
keys associated with the object) drops to zero, or the SVL task ends.

</p>

<p>Once destroyed, a key is invalid and should never be used again.
</p>

<p><a name="gr_key"></a></p>
<p><hr noshade /></p>
    
<pre>
key = <span class="fcndef">gr_key</span> key
</pre>

<p>Returns 0 if the indicated key is not valid (e.g. has been destroyed or
was never created).  Using the returned key instead of the original key in
the primitive drawing functions ensures silent failure -- the functions
generate errors if a bad key is given, but do not complain about key 0.

</p>

<p><a name="gr_setheader"></a></p>
<p><a name="gr_header"></a></p>
<p><hr noshade /></p>

<pre>
header = <span class="fcndef">gr_header</span> key

<span class="fcndef">gr_setheader</span> [ key, header ]
</pre>

<p>Gets or sets a header in its entirety. <tt>gr_header</tt> returns a tagged
vector containing all the header elements; <tt>gr_setheader</tt>
replaces <i>all</i> header elements with the tagged vector provided.

</p>

<pre>
    svl&gt; hdr = gr_header key;
    svl&gt; hdr.title = 'another diagram';
    svl&gt; gr_setheader [key, hdr];
</pre>

<p>The above example fetches, modifies, and resubmits a header.

</p>

<p>There is no guarantee that changes to a header will be propagated
immediately, or even properly, if the object is already in use. For instance if
the size of an object is changed when it is already a layout feature of a
widget, the panel will not immediately resize itself, and may not display
correctly until there is an external cue to do so.

</p>

<h4>Drawing Primitives</h4>

<p>A flat graphics object starts out containing 0 primitives, and can be
extended indefinitely, subject to memory availability. Each call to one of the
drawing primitives appends one primitive to the end. Order is preserved. There
is no direct way to delete, rearrange or query the contents of flat graphical
objects, except via the serialization functions described later.

</p>

<p>While each call to a primitive drawing function creates exactly 1
primitive, most of the primitives are themselves vectors, and can have
any number of elements. For instance the <tt>gr_line</tt> function can
be used to append a primitive for drawing just one line, but it can also
be used to append a primitive containing 0, 2, or <i>N</i> lines. The
vector notations are described for the individual functions. There are
two exceptions: <tt>gr_curve</tt> describes just one specific entity,
which happens to have a variable number of points; <tt>gr_pixmap</tt>
encodes for just one pixmap, which is itself a 2D matrix of points.

</p>

<p>All of the primitives require one or more sets of coordinates. These should
generally be within the boundaries of the <tt>size</tt> parameter in the
header. Any object which lies wholly or entirely outside the region may be
clipped on rendering, depending on the device. Clipping is <i>never</i>
performed at the graphics object level, i.e. a primitive which has no overlap
with the defined boundaries will still be included in the underlying data
structure.

</p>

<p>Coordinates of the (x, y) variety are assumed to be in the units of the
object (i.e. pixels or points). The directions are in mathematical space, i.e.
the origin (0,0) is at the bottom left; increasing X is to the right, and
increasing Y is up.

</p>

<div align="center">
<img src="grfcn/mathcoord.gif" alt="Mathematical Coordinates" />
</div>

<p>This can be disconcerting if one is accustomed to screen coordinates,
which have their origin at the top right. The above diagram shows a box
specified by coordinates (x1,y1)-(x2,y2); the first point refers to the
bottom left corner of the box, the second, the top right. The exact
interpretations of the coordinates are explained with the definitions of
each primitive.

</p>

<p>All coordinates and sizes are double-precision floating point numbers.
Fractional positions are valid, because it is often possible that the final
output device may support sub-pixel addressing or be operating at a greater
resolution than anticipated.

</p>

<p>While coordinates must be considered always potentially scalable (there is
the possibility of stretching or squashing during the final rendering process),
there are two ways to specify <i>size</i> values (three, in some cases):

</p>

<ol>

<li><i>Positive numbers.</i>  These are used for features such as line
thickness or font height, and will be scaled along with coordinates; for
instance if the rendered output was magnified twofold, so also would be
the size.

</li>

<li><i>Negative numbers.</i>  These are also used for features such as
line thickness or font height, but while the numbers may be altered
by the initial mapping from points into device pixels, any subsequent
transformations will <i>not scale</i>, and the absolute value will absolutely
be used; for instance, if a thickness of -3 was specified for a line,
no amount of zooming will change this.

</li>

<li><i>Zero.</i>  This is used for thicknesses only, and implies device
minimum pixel size, typically used to draw a "hairline", or 1-pixel border.

</li>
</ol>

<p>Most of the primitives require at least one color specification. Colors
are specified as integer values of the general form 0xTTRRGGBB: 8-bits
each for transparency, red, green and blue. Pure maximum intensity red is
0xFF0000, green is 0xFF00, blue is 0xFF. Colors are interpreted as sRGB
values, gamma-corrected such that the halfway value component (0x80)
represents 50% intensity.  Note that some output devices may introduce
additional corrections, but it may be possible to calibrate them
to achieve (near-) linearity.

</p>

<p>The high order byte of a color is the <i>transparency</i> (not to be
confused with alpha channel, its complement), whereby a mask of 0xFF000000
means completely transparent, and no bits set in this range means completely
opaque. Completely transparent colors can be used to specify no-operation,
which is useful for primitives such as <tt>gr_box</tt> where two colors are
mandated. A useful shortcut for the no-operation color is -1, which is
equivalent to 0xFFFFFFFF on 32-bit platforms, but is also defined to have the
same meaning in the event of 64-bit integers being used.

</p>

<p>Color values can be entered directly, usually as hexadecimal, or
by using the <a class="svl" href="icolor.htm">icolor</a> function,
e.g. <tt>icolor'black'</tt>.

</p>

<p>The extent to which partial transparency is honored depends on the device.
Some devices do not support any intrinsic notion of alpha blending, and so the
final rendering of partial transparency may be implemented by use of dithering,
or reducing the 8 bits to merely on/off.

</p>

<p>By default, flat graphical objects have no concept of a background color,
and so all of the primitives will be drawn into their designated region,
overlaid on top of any existing content. This is not the case when the
<i>opacity</i> header attribute is set to a solid color, which causes
the rendering region to be painted with this color before drawing any of
the primitives.

</p>

<p>All of the functions for drawing primitives return the bounding box
of the primitives created by the action, in the coordinate units of the
object itself.  For the geometric drawing functions (points, lines, boxes,
ovals and curves) the bounding box can be calculated precisely. For text
primitives, the bounding region must be considered imprecise, because the
calculation is done before the output device is known, and there is some
variation in choice of fonts and kerning methodologies.

</p>

<p>The first parameter of each drawing primitive is <tt>id</tt>, which is an
arbitrary floating point number which is associated with the primitive. For
most purposes, this should be given as 0.

</p>

<p><a name="gr_point"></a></p>
<p><hr noshade /></p>

<pre>
bounds = <span class="fcndef">gr_point</span> [ key, [ id, [ x, y ], col, size ] ]
</pre>

<p>Draws some number of points at the indicated positions, with the selected
color and size. No-operation colors (i.e. full transparency colors) will
result in invisible points. A size of 0 has a special meaning, and will
result in a single device-pixel being drawn.  Nonzero sizes imply points
which are circular, and the size can be considered to be the diameter of the
circle; negative size values imply nonscalability.  Points are always
solid, unless the color indicates transparency, in which case they will
be alpha blended or dithered, depending on the capabilities of the device.

</p>

<p>The return value is 4 scalars of the form <tt>[[x1, y1], [x2, y2]]</tt>,
which is a bounding box that contains all of the points, taking into account
their sizes.

</p>

<p>Unit extension may be used for any of the parameters after <tt>id</tt>, for
instance:

</p>

<pre>
    svl&gt; gr_point [key, [0, [[1, 2, 3], [5, 5, 5]], 0xFF0000, [2, 2, 2]]
    svl&gt; gr_point [key, [0, [[1, 2, 3], 5], 0xFF0000, 2]
</pre>

<p>
are exactly equivalent, and will both draw 3 red dots lined up in a row.

</p>

<p>The following code will produce a pattern of random dots with random sizes
and colors in a 100 x 100 unit square:

</p>

<pre>
    svl&gt; gr_point [key, [0,
             [app rand rep [100, 100], app rand rep [100, 100]],
             app rand rep [0xFFFFFF, 100],
             app rand rep [5, 100]
         ]];
        
</pre>

<p><a name="gr_line"></a></p>
<p><hr noshade /></p>

<pre>
bounds = <span class="fcndef">gr_line</span> [ key, [ id, [ x1, y1 ], [ x2, y2 ], col, size ] ]
</pre>

<p>Draws some number of simple lines, with the from/to coordinates as
specified. The line points are inclusive, i.e. it may be taken as given that
the device pixels at both ends will be drawn. The line (x1,y1)-(x2,y2) is the
same as (x2,y2)-(x1,y1).

</p>

<p>This primitive supports two further parameters, <tt>col</tt> and
<tt>size</tt>. As for all primitives, the colors support transparency. The
size may be positive, zero or negative, for scalable thickness, hairline, and
nonscalable thickness.

</p>

<p>The capped ends of the line are defined to be rounded, and will be rendered
as such if the thickness is sufficient for there to be a distinction. Note that
the primitive <tt>gr_curve</tt> can be used instead to achieve more
sophisticated style control.

</p>

<p>The following example creates three black lines:

</p>

<pre>
    svl&gt; gr_line [key, [0,
             [[50, 72, 72], [70, 65, 75]],
             [[60, 78, 78], [70, 56, 84]],
             icolor'black',
             1
         ]];
</pre>

<p><a name="gr_box"></a></p>
<p><hr noshade /></p>

<pre>
bounds = <span class="fcndef">gr_box</span> [ key, [ id, [ x1, y1 ], [ x2, y2 ], col, size, fill ] ]
</pre>

<p>Draws some number of boxes, using the lower and upper coordinates to form
the rectangles.  Each set of coordinates in the form of (x1,y1)-(x2,y2) must
satisfy the conditions x1 &lt; x2 and y1 &lt; y2, otherwise the rectangle is
invalid and no box will be drawn.

</p>

<p>The <tt>col</tt> parameter refers to the color of the border drawn around
the box; a no-operation color (such as -1) will result in no border being
drawn. The <tt>size</tt> parameter is the thickness of this border (see
<tt>gr_line</tt>), and is only relevant if the border color is other than a
no-operation. The edges of the box are always drawn in a squared (rather than
rounded) manner.

<p>The <tt>fill</tt> parameter is the color for the interior of the box, and may
be a no-operation color. As with all colors, transparency is supported. If both
fill and border are enabled, there is the possibility of overlap if the border
thickness evaluates to more than one pixel on the output device; the box is
filled first, then the border is drawn around it, the line itself being drawn
centered on the exact edge of the box.

</p>

<p>The following example draws a single box with a black border and a pale gray
interior:

</p>

<pre>
    svl&gt; gr_box [key, [0, 
             [1, 1],
             [99, 99],
             icolor'black',
             1,
             0xE0E0E0
         ]];
</pre>


<p><a name="gr_oval"></a></p>
<p><hr noshade /></p>

<pre>
bounds = <span class="fcndef">gr_oval</span> [ key, [ id, [ cx, cy ], [ rw, rh ], col, size, fill ] ]
</pre>

<p>Draws some number of ovals (circles or ellipses). Coordinates are specified
as the <i>center</i> positions, and radial extents for both the axes. For
instance, the coordinates (10,10);(2,2) create a circle with the centre at
(10,10), a diameter of 4, and a bounding box of (8,8)-(12,12). Circles are drawn
by repeating the radius; ellipses are drawn by specifying different values for
the radial width and radial height.

</p>

<p>Other than the different coordinate style, the parameters and behavior are
analogous to <tt>gr_box</tt>.

</p>

<p>The following example draws a single circle with a black outline and an
empty interior:

<pre>
    svl&gt; gr_oval [key, [0,
            [30, 70],
            [14, 14],
            icolor'black',
            1,
            -1
        ]];
</pre>

<p><a name="gr_curve"></a></p>
<p><hr noshade /></p>

<pre>
bounds = <span class="fcndef">gr_curve</span> [ key, [ id, [ x, y ], [ dx, dy ], edge, col, size, cap, fill ] ]
</pre>

<p>The curve is a relatively complex primitive which encapsulates
several major drawing features, some of which are refinements of the previously
described primitives. <tt>gr_curve</tt> should be used when one or more of the
following features is needed:

</p>

<ul>

<li>open polygons, with controllable line-join styles;
</li>

<li>closed polygons of arbitrary shape, with filled interiors;
</li>

<li>curved lines with specifiable gradients;
</li>

<li>polygons with non-linear edges;
</li>

<li>lines with specific dot-pattern styles.
</li>

</ul>

<p>The <tt>[x, y]</tt> parameters contain all of the points that make up the
construct. The lines are implied by connecting up the points in order, then
reconnecting the last point to the first point. Edges are described in sequence.
For instance, a curve made up of [[x1,x2,x3],[y1,y2,y3]] has three implied
edges, which are (x1,y1)-(x2,y2), (x2,y2)-(x3,y3) and (x3,y3)-(x1,y1), in that
order.

</p>

<p>The <tt>[dx, dy]</tt> parameters specify the gradient at the corresponding
point. If the lines are to be straight, i.e. direct path between point N and
point N+1, specify the gradients as (0,0). When the curve is being depicted on
the rendering device, two points N and N+1 are converted into a curve using the
gradients at either end, if either one of them is non-null. A gradient pointing
in the general direction of the line, at both points, will result in a
near-linear or gentle curve. Gradients pointing in opposite directions to one
another, or to the line vector, produce more striking deviations from the
straight-edge case.

</p>

<p>The <tt>edge</tt> vector can be specified in two ways. If the primitive does
not make use of the various line patterns, it is convenient to use the numeric
shortcut, where 0 evaluates to no edge, and 1 evaluates to a solid edge. Unit
extension of 1 can concisely specify a closed shape; an open shape might be
specified as, say, [1,1,1,1,0] for a shape of 5 points which describe 4
consecutively connected lines.

</p>

<p>To make use of line styles, the <tt>edge</tt> vector should be specified
using tokens instead (note that it is not valid to mix numbers and tokens for
this parameter). Valid token values are <tt>'none'</tt>, <tt>'solid'</tt>,
<tt>'dashed'</tt>, <tt>'dotted'</tt> and <tt>'dashdot'</tt>. The partial-line
styles are self-explanatory. The exact spacing of the dots and dashes scales
with the line thickness, i.e. a line twice as thick will have double the
spacing.

</p>

<p>The <tt>col</tt> parameter refers to the colors of the edges. It is possible
to prevent some edges from being drawn by specifying non-operation colors, but
the proper way to disable certain edges is with the <tt>edge</tt> parameter.

</p>

<p><tt>size</tt> refers to the thickness of the edge lines, and uses the same
conventions as previously described primitives such as <tt>gr_line</tt>.

</p>

<p><tt>cap</tt> describes the manner in which points (vertices) are capped or
connected, depending on the number of connections. Vector elements correspond to
points. They may be specified as numbers or tokens, but not both. 0 or <tt>'rounded'</tt>
means that line-ends will be drawn as it capped by a circle with the diameter of
the line thickness, and that line-joins will be smoothed. 1 or <tt>'squared'</tt> means
that line-ends will be drawn as if ended with a box, rotated to be
parallel/orthogonal to the direction of the line, and line-joins will be drawn
in a mitered fashion.

</p>

<p>The <tt>fill</tt> parameter differs from the others in that it is a scalar,
and providing a vector quantity will result in an error. It is the color which
is to be used to fill the shape. A no-operation color (such as -1) will prevent
any filling. Filling is done in an even/odd fashion, if the line sequence
crosses over itself. It is quite valid to have some non-drawn edges for filled
curves; the filling process ignores the edge status.

</p>

<p>The following example uses a simple formula to generate an unfilled closed
polygon (a hexagon):

</p>

<pre>
    svl&gt; gr_curve [key, [0,
             [30 + 20 * cos ((1/3) * PI * dec igen 6),
              70 + 20 * sin ((1/3) * PI * dec igen 6)],
             [0, 0],
             1,
             icolor'black',
             1,
             0,
             -1
         ]];
</pre>

<p>This next example draws a single line between two points, which is slightly
warped, has a dotted line-style, and is unfilled and unclosed:

</p>

<pre>
    svl&gt; gr_curve [key, [0,
             [[80, 80], [60, 80]],
             [[-15, 15], 20],
             ['dotted', 'none'],
             0x808080,
             1,
             0,
             -1
         ]];
</pre>

<p><a name="gr_text"></a></p>
<p><hr noshade /></p>

<pre>
bounds_b = <span class="fcndef">gr_text</span> [ key, [ id, [ x, y ], text, font, col, size, opt ] ]
</pre>

<p>Draws some number of text fragments with indicated positions and properties.

</p>

<p>The <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt> values are the reference positions for the
text, but which point they refer to depends on the options (see below).

</p>

<p><tt>text</tt> is the text fragment to be drawn, and must be given as tokens.
A subset of HTML is supported, and the text may be multi-line. The following
HTML tags are recognized:

</p>

<pre>
    &lt;b&gt; ... &lt;/b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt; ... &lt;/i&gt;
    &lt;u&gt; ... &lt;/u&gt;
    &lt;big&gt; ... &lt;/big&gt;
    &lt;small&gt; ... &lt;/small&gt;
    &lt;sup&gt; ... &lt;/sup&gt;
    &lt;sub&gt; ... &lt;/sub&gt;
    &lt;tt&gt; ... &lt;/tt&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
</pre>

<p>The HTML parsing is simple, and tags can only be specified in their basic
form, without any accompanying attributes, and should be supplied in lower
case. Except for the line breaks (<tt>p</tt> and <tt>br</tt>), all tags should
be closed. Also, certain HTML entities such as &amp;lt; and &amp;gt; are
necessarily supported.

</p>

<p>The <tt>font</tt> parameter is the base font and style for the text which is
used throughout, except where modified by HTML tags within the text (such as
super/subscript, big/small, and tt). There are four base fonts:

</p>

<pre>
    sys
    rm
    sf
    tt
</pre>

<p>These are specified as tokens (<tt>'sys'</tt>, <tt>'rm'</tt>, <tt>'sf'</tt>,
<tt>'tt'</tt>), and approximately correspond to, respectively: "system" font
not unlike the default font used by MOE; "Roman" (such as Times New Roman),
"Serif" (such as Arial) and "TeleType" (non-proportionally spaced, generally a
Courier-like font). Although bold and italic can be accomplished by using HTML
tags within the text, it is also valid to append  <tt>'-b'</tt>, <tt>'-i'</tt>
or <tt>'-bi'</tt> to the font, e.g. 'sys-bi' refers to the emboldened &amp;
italicized version of the system font.

</p>

<p>The actual font used depends on the output device. Scalable fonts may be
assumed for all output devices, and so fractional increments in font size will
be handled reasonably.

</p>

<p>The <tt>col</tt> parameter refers to the color of the characters being
drawn. Note that there is never any background-drawing effect, and the only
device pixels which are eventually drawn are those of the characters themselves.

</p>

<p><tt>size</tt> is the nominal height of the font. Negative numbers can be used
to specify the drawing of text which is invariant to scaling. When rendering to
devices that support continuous scaling of fonts, there is no implied font size
increment. Some devices however have a limited selection of sizes, and so an
algorithm will be used to determine the closest size.

</p>

<p><tt>opt</tt> is a tagged vector, and may be omitted entirely from the
function call if all the defaults are desired. All of the options are scalar and
apply to the contents of the primitive, i.e. if multiple text items are
incorporated, the options given are the same for all.

</p>

<p>Options supported are:

</p>

<ul>

<li>

<tt>position</tt>: Determines the manner in which the (x,y) coordinates
are interpreted. The default behavior is <tt>'baselineleft'</tt>, which means
that the (x,y) coordinate is that of the baseline of the first line of text;
characters are drawn from left to right, with their ascent upward and descent
downward. Variations on baseline positioning are <tt>'baselinecenter'</tt> and
<tt>'baselineright'</tt>, in which cases the y-position also refers to the
baseline of the text, but the x-position refers to the center or right,
respectively.


<p>Other valid values are <tt>'topleft'</tt>, <tt>'topcenter'</tt>,
<tt>'topright'</tt>, <tt>'middleleft'</tt>, <tt>'middlecenter'</tt>,
<tt>'middleright'</tt>, <tt>'bottomleft'</tt>, <tt>'bottomcenter'</tt>,
<tt>'bottomright'</tt>, which are the box-based positioning modes:

</p>

<p>
<div align="center">
<img src="grfcn/grob2.gif" alt="Positioning Schematic" />
</div>
</p>

<p>As shown in the schematic above, the box represents the <i>entire</i> size
of the text, which is calculated first. Depending on the value of
<tt>position</tt>, the text is placed such that the box is relative to one of
the nine locations as indicated. The box size is the amount of space determined
<i>at the time of rendering</i> to encapsulate all of the text precisely, to the
nearest device pixel. It includes the font ascents and descents within its
bounds.

</p></li>

<li><tt>alignment</tt>: Only relevant for text that spans multiple lines.
The total bounding box of the text is drawn and positioned regardless of the
text alignment, but once text drawing commences, the lines are positioned
according to this parameter. The default value is <tt>'left'</tt>; alternatives
are <tt>'center'</tt> and <tt>'right'</tt>.

</li>

</ul>

<p>The return value of <tt>gr_text</tt> is slightly different to the other
primitives, and is of the form <tt>[[x1, y1], [x2, y2], b]</tt>, where the
first two vectors contain the bounding box, and the final number is the
y-position of the baseline of the first line of text. The return value also
differs from the other primitives in that the numbers must be assumed to
contain a systematic error. This is because depending on the output device, the
choice of font, the spacing algorithm and the device pixel rounding policy may
vary. Therefore the data must be considered to be an estimate, and relying on
the return value to provide pixel-level precision is not advisable.

</p>

<p>The following example is the simplest possible invocation style, drawing the
text "Hello World!" from its baseline:

</p>

<pre>
    svl&gt; gr_text [key, [0, 
             [10, 10], 
             'Hello World!',
             'sys',
             icolor'black',
             10
         ]];
</pre>

<p>The next example draws two lines of text, with some embedded HTML effects,
and a boxed-based text position, followed by a vectorized example:

</p>

<pre>
    svl&gt; gr_text [key, [0,
             [50, 5],
             '&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sodium benzoate&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;'
               '&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C enriched&lt;/small&gt;',
             'sf',
             icolor'black',
             8,
             [position: 'bottomcenter', alignment: 'center']
         ]];

    svl&gt; gr_text [key, [0,
             [[60, 78, 78, 50, 82], [70, 52, 88, 40, 70]],
             ['&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C', 'O', 'O', 'Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;', '-'],
             'rm',
             [icolor'red', 0, 0, 0, 0],
             8,
             [position: 'middleleft']
         ]];
</pre>

<p><a name="gr_pixmap"></a></p>
<p><hr noshade /></p>

<pre>
bounds = <span class="fcndef">gr_pixmap</span> [ key, [ id, [ x, y ], [ w, h ], matrix ] ]
</pre>

<p>Draws a single pixmap with the given position and scaling properties, and the
content matrix.

</p>

<p>The <tt>[x, y]</tt> parameters reference the top left point of the
rectangular pixmap. Consistent with most internal pixmap representations, the
pixels are drawn to the right and <i>down</i> from the given position.

</p>

<p><tt>[w, h]</tt> refer to the shape into which the pixmap should be mapped,
i.e. a bounding box of (x, y - |h|)-(x + |w|, y). This rectangle will be
stretched or compacted in either direction as eventual device scaling dictates.
Like the <tt>size</tt> parameters of the other primitives, both <tt>w</tt> and
<tt>h</tt> may be negative, which makes them nonscaling. Zero has a special
meaning: the pixmap will be drawn with a 1:1 correlation between pixels in the
pixmap and pixels on the device. This is appropriate only for device-specific
uses such as within widgets, and even then usually only in cases where it is
known that the object itself will not be scaled.

</p>

<p><tt>matrix</tt> contains the pixmap itself. The format is a 2-dimensional
matrix of pixels, the primary dimension being the Y-axis (top to bottom), the
secondary dimension being the X-axis (left to right). Each cell should be an
integer using the same TRGB color format as the other primitives, i.e.
0xTTRRGGBB. As for other drawing functions, the transparency byte is nominally
continuous between 0 .. 255, but the actual device implementations do not
guarantee this, and may round to on/off, or use a dithering pattern. It is safe
to assume that when none of the TT bits are set the point is opaque, and when
all the bits are set the point is entirely transparent. The same gamma
correction method is used for pixmaps as for other primitives, i.e. 0x80 is
defined to be 50% intensity.

</p>

<p>The following is a trivial example of a 2 x 2 pixmap, drawn in a
device-dependent pixel-to-pixel manner. The top left pixel is transparent, and
the others are RGB primary colors:

</p>

<pre>
    svl&gt; gr_pixmap [key, [0,
             [50, 50],
             [0, 0],
             [[0xFF000000, 0x00FF0000],
              [0x0000FF00, 0x000000FF]]
         ]];
</pre>

<p>The next example applies a simple formula to a vector of strings, which
represents a simple glyph; the X's are translated into solid black pixels, and
the dots are translated into transparent pixels. The width and height are
submitted such that one pixmap pixel is one object coordinate unit, so the
pixmap will be scaled as necessary during the final rendering:

</p>

<pre>
    svl&gt; delta = [
             ".....X.....",
             "....X.X....",
             "...X...X...",
             "..X.....X..",
             ".X.......X.",
             "XXXXXXXXXXX"
         ];
    
    svl&gt; gr_pixmap [key, [0,
             [0, 70],
             [l_length delta, length delta],
             (delta == ".") * 0xFFFFFFFF
         ]];

<h4>Serialization</h4>

<pre>
<span class="fcndef">gr_draw</span> [ key, source_vector, xform ]
<span class="fcndef">gr_draw</span> [ key, source_key, xform ]

data = <span class="fcndef">gr_data</span> key
</pre>

<p>Although flat graphical objects are manipulated internally by MOE, they can
be extracted and reconstructed in an SVL vector notation which is very similar
to the commands used to draw the primitives.

</p>

<p>For a sequence of drawing primitives in the general form of:

</p>

<pre>
    gr_{prim1} [ key, [ ...{data1}... ] ]
    gr_{prim2} [ key, [ ...{data2}... ] ]
    ...
    gr_{primN} [ key, [ ...{dataN}... ] ]
</pre>

<p>... the serialized analog would be an SVL vector of the form:

</p>

<pre>
[
    [ 'gr_{prim1}, [ ...{data1}... ] ]
    [ 'gr_{prim2}, [ ...{data2}... ] ]
    ...
    [ 'gr_{primN}, [ ...{dataN}... ] ]
]
</pre>

<p>Essentially the key has been substituted for a token of the actual primitive
function. This is the format of the return value of <tt>gr_data</tt>, and the
format accepted by <tt>gr_draw</tt>.

</p>

<p><tt>gr_data</tt> simply returns the primitives contained within a current
graphics object, in the above format. 

</p>

<p><tt>gr_draw</tt> has two invocations: if the source is a vector of the form
described above, the primitives will be drawn into the destination key as if the
corresponding commands had been called directly. If the source is the key of an
existing object, the content of that object will be used.

</p>

<p>The <tt>gr_draw</tt> function accepts an optional parameter for transforming
the source coordinates in the form of the <tt>xform</tt> argument: <tt>[ox, oy,
sw, sh]</tt>. The 4-number vector may be omitted or partially specified. The
scaling parameters <tt>sw</tt> and <tt>sh</tt> are applied first, followed by
the translation parameters <tt>ox</tt> and <tt>oy</tt>. Partial specifications
are such that the following equivalences hold:

</p>

<pre>
    []               === [0, 0, 1, 1]
    oxy              === [oxy, oxy, 1, 1]
    [ox, oy]         === [ox, oy, 1, 1]
    [ox, oy, swh]    === [ox, oy, swh, swh]
    [ox, oy, sw, sh] === [ox, oy, sw, sh]
</pre>

<p>The default value, <tt>[0, 0, 1, 1]</tt> is equivalent to no change of
coordinates.

</p>

<p>As described for the various <tt>size</tt> parameters of primitives, scaling
done by <tt>gr_draw</tt> is one occasion where negative values are honored where
appropriate, i.e. 2x scaling for a size of 10 will cause the new size to be 20,
but a size of -10 will remain as -10. 

</p>

<p>These two functions can be combined to create a new object with the same
data, for instance:

</p>

<pre>
    svl&gt; local newkey = gr_create gr_header oldkey;
    svl&gt; gr_draw [newkey, gr_data oldkey];
</pre>

<p>A similar method can be used to create an identical object of double the
size:

</p>

<pre>
    svl&gt; local header = gr_header oldkey;
    svl&gt; local newkey = gr_create tagpoke [
             header,
             'size',
             header.size * 2
         ];
    svl&gt; gr_draw [newkey, oldkey, [0, 0, 2, 2]];
</pre>

<p>Note that the first example explicitly serializes the content using
<tt>gr_data</tt>, whereas the second example achieves the same effect
implicitly by providing the key as the source.

</p>

<p><a name="gr_render_pixmap"></a></p>
<h4>Image Rendering</h4>

<pre>
img = <span class="fcndef">gr_render_pixmap</span> [ img, source ]
img = <span class="fcndef">gr_render_pixmap</span> [ img, source, xform ]
img = <span class="fcndef">gr_render_pixmap</span> [ img, source, xform, clip ]
</pre>

<p>Flat graphics objects can be rendered directly into an SVL data structure
using the <tt>gr_render_pixmap</tt> function.

</p>

<p>The substrate for the rendering is the <tt>img</tt> parameter which is a
matrix of integer values, in the TRGB format: 8 significant bits each for
transparency (0xFF000000), red (0xFF0000), green (0xFF00) and blue (0xFF).
<tt>source</tt> is either the key of an instantiated graphic object, or the SVL
vector representation of a graphic object. <tt>xform</tt> is an optional
transformation of the form <tt>[ox, oy, sw, sh]</tt> (identical to that
described for <tt>gr_draw</tt>), and <tt>clip</tt> is an optional bounding
rectangle <tt>[x1, y1, x2, y2]</tt> in the coordinates of the destination
system. The default clipping region is the extent of the image matrix, but it
can be reduced by using the <tt>clip</tt> parameter. The return value is the new
image matrix which has the rendering applied to it. If the graphical object
contained no primitives, it would be the same as the <tt>img</tt> parameter.

</p>

<p><tt>img</tt> should be a vector of vectors where the row corresponds to the
Y-coordinate (top to bottom) and the column to the X-coordinate (left to
right), where each element is an integer which corresponds to a pixel. Note
that this coordinate system is different from the coordinates used within the
<tt>key</tt> source and the <tt>xform</tt> and <tt>clip</tt> parameters. The
returned image is suitable for use with the <tt>gr_pixmap</tt> primitive, and
can also be used for writing bitmaps to files. The data structure is suitable
for multiple calls to <tt>gr_render_pixmap</tt>.

</p>

<p>The rendering process has complete support for transparency within the
<tt>img</tt> parameter, the returned image matrix, and all of the primitives
which are extracted from <tt>key</tt>.

</p>

<p>The input pixmap is considered to be the background for the rendering
operation. Common starting points for an image include:

</p>

<pre>
    img = rep [rep [0x00FFFFFF, width], height]; // white background
    img = rep [rep [0x00000000, width], height]; // black background
    img = rep [rep [0xFF000000, width], height]; // transparent background
</pre>

<p>The following example draws a graphical object onto an opaque black
background 50 x 50 pixels in size, and assumes that the coordinates of the
graphical object in <tt>key</tt> are already suitably positioned and scaled:

</p>

<pre>
    img = rep [rep [0, 50], 50];
    img = gr_render_pixmap [img, key];
</pre>

<p>The next example maps a graphical object onto a partially transparent red
background with size reduction, offset and clipping:

</p>

<pre>
    img = rep [rep [0x80FF0000, 100], 50];
    img = gr_render_pixmap [img, key, [25,0,0.5,0.5], [25,0,75,0]];
</pre>

<p>The following example creates a very simple graphics object, renders it into
a pixmap with a transparent background, uses translation and scaling to draw
another smaller copy overtop, then writes the resulting pixmap to a raster file
(PNG format).

</p>

<pre>
    grkey = gr_create [];
    gr_box [grkey, [0, [5,5], [45,45], -1, 0, icolor'blue']];
    gr_oval [grkey, [0, [25,25], [24,15], icolor'black', 0, icolor'white']];
    img = rep [rep [0xFF000000, 50], 50];
    img = gr_render_pixmap [img, grkey]; 			// draw full-size
    img = gr_render_pixmap [img, grkey, [20,20,0.2,0.2]]; 	// miniature
    gr_destroy grkey;
    fwrite_PNG ['test.png', img];

<pre>
mimetypes = <span class="fcndef">gr_encode</span> []
data      = <span class="fcndef">gr_encode</span> [ source, mimetype, xform, opt ]
</pre>

<p>Returns a binary representation based on the provided graphic object, in the
format specified by the given MIME type. If <tt>gr_encode</tt> is called without
arguments, the return value is a laminated vector of the form
<span class="nobr"><tt>[mimetype, extension, description]</tt></span>. The available MIME
types are various types of embeddable graphics, of both raster and vector
flavors.

</p>

<p>The <tt>source</tt> parameter must refer either to an instantiated graphic
object key, or the serialized vector representation of a graphic object.
<tt>mimetype</tt> must be a token which corresponds to a supported MIME type.
The <tt>xform</tt> parameter, of the form <span class="nobr"><tt>[ox, oy, sw,
sh]</tt></span>, is optional, and will default to <tt>[0,0,1,1]</tt>. The offset
parts, <tt>ox</tt> and <tt>oy</tt>, are irrelevant for most of the output
formats, and will be ignored. The scaling parts, <tt>sw</tt> and <tt>sh</tt>,
are honored, and will also affect the dimensions of the output. The width and
height of the output graphic are determined from the <tt>size</tt> member of the
graphic object header, to which the scaling part of the <tt>xform</tt> parameter
is also applied. The <tt>opt</tt> parameter is a tagged vector, with meaning
that varies depending on the output type.

<p>The following table has a brief description of the encoding schemes for each
of the MIME types:

<p><table class="titlebar" border="1" cellpadding="5">

<tr>
<th>MIME&nbsp;Type</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="baseline"><tt>image/png</tt></td>
<td valign="baseline">

The Portable Network Graphic (PNG) scheme. For most purposes, this format is the
preferred choice for raster images, since it provides for efficient and largely
lossless compression, as well as 24-bit color and full alpha transparency. It is
understood by almost all external applications which manipulate raster graphics.

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="baseline"><tt>image/jpeg</tt></td>
<td valign="baseline">

The Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) scheme. While this raster format is
widely implemented and highly appropriate for photograph-style graphics, the
lossy compression algorithms do not always provide a faithful representation of
line drawings, and there is no concept of transparency.

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="baseline"><tt>image/gif</tt></td>
<td valign="baseline">

The Graphical Interchange Format (GIF) scheme, an 8-bit palette-based raster
format, which has an optional single color reserved for on/off transparency.
This format is obsolete, and should not be used except for cases when an
external application may not be able to use the PNG format.

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="baseline"><tt>image/bmp</tt></td>
<td valign="baseline">

The Windows Bitmap scheme, which supports full color and alpha transparency.
This format is useful for interaction with native Windows applications, but the
compression scheme is limited, which results in large output files. It is also
not widely implemented amongst non Windows-specific applications.

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="baseline"><tt>image/x-emf</tt></td>
<td valign="baseline">

The Windows Enhanced Metafile Plus scheme, which is a serialized representation
of Windows GDI+ drawing functions, described by a <a
href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc204376.aspx">Microsoft
specification</a>. It is important to note that only the advanced EMF+ graphics
instructions are included in the output. For some implementations of the format,
older EMF graphics instructions are contained alongside the newer equivalents
for backward compatibility purposes. For most practical purposes, the output
from this encoding scheme must be considered specific to Windows platforms,
though the data can be generated on any platform.

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="baseline"><tt>image/svg+xml</tt></td>
<td valign="baseline">

<p>
The Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) scheme, which is an XML dialect described by
a <a href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/">W3C specification</a>. This
specification is a superset of the functionality provided by graphic objects,
allowing the graphic object primitives to be translated to SVG primitives.
Before using this format, it is advisable to examine the completeness of
implementation by the intended rendering devices.

</p>

<p>The SVG format does not allow for embedded pixmaps, which can only be
implemented by writing external files.  By default, <tt>gr_encode</tt> will not
include any pixmap primitives in the output. If the <tt>opt</tt> parameter
includes the tag <tt><span class="nobr">[imagepfx: <i>token</i>]</span></tt>, then for each
pixmap contained in the graphic object, a file will be written with
<tt><i>token</i></tt> as the base name. These files will be referenced from
within the SVG content.

</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="baseline"><tt>image/grob</tt></td>
<td valign="baseline">

An internal encoding scheme for graphic objects, which is a direct
translation of the serialized data. The format is whitespace-insensitive text.

</td>
</tr>

<p><a name="gr_fwrite"></a></p>
<p><hr noshade /></p>

<pre>
<span class="fcndef">gr_fwrite</span> [ file, source, mimetype, xform, opt ]
</pre>

<p>The <tt>gr_fwrite</tt> function performs the same task as the
<tt>gr_encode</tt> function, except that instead of returning the encoded data,
it is written to the given indicated file descriptor. The <tt>file</tt>
parameter can be either a filename token, or the handle of a file which is
currently open for output.
