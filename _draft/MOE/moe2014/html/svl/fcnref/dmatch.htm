<h2>Description</h2>
Functions <tt>dmatch_...</tt> are intended to produce all possible
matches (pairings) between features of a "constraint"
and an "instance":

<ul>
<p><li>
A <i>constraint</i> is a set of <i>features</i>
together with a pair of numbers associated with every pair of
features in the set.&nbsp;These numbers,
<tt>D_MIN(y1,y2)</tt> and
<tt>D_MAX(y1,y2)</tt>,
are non-negative and represent minimum and maximum distances
between the two features
<tt>y1</tt> and <tt>y2</tt>.

<p><li>
An <i>instance</i> is a set of features together
with a single number associated with every pair of features in the set.&nbsp;
This number,
<tt>D(x1,x2)</tt>,
is non-negative and represents the distance between the two features
<tt>x1</tt> and <tt>x2</tt>.

<p><li>
A <i>match</i> specifies a mapping between features of the constraint and
the features of the instance, such that the distance between any two
instance features <tt>x1</tt> and <tt>x2</tt> that map to
two constraint features <tt>y1</tt> and <tt>y2</tt> satisfies the following:

<center>
<pre>
    D_MIN(y1,y2) &lt;= D(x1,x2) &lt;= D_MAX(y1,y2)
</pre>
</center>

</ul>

<p>
The matches are obtained by interrogating a special <i>query</i> object.
The query must first be supplied
with the parameters of the constraint, the instance and the
required properties of the match.
It is then iteratively interrogated for one match at a time,
until all possible matches are obtained.
The same query object can be used successively to match several instances
to the same constraint or several constraints to the same instance.

<p> Features are numbered from 1 to <i>K</i>, where <i>K</i> is the
number of features.

The distances between features are specified by a distance matrix.
The element in row <i>i</i> and column <i>j</i> of the distance matrix
represents the distance between feature <i>i</i> and <i>j</i>.

The constraint is specified by setting
the matrix of the minimum distances and the matrix of the maximum distances
either explicitly, with <tt>dmatch_cdist</tt>,
or implicitly, with <tt>dmatch_cpos</tt>.

The instance is specified by setting
the matrix of distances
either explicitly, with <tt>dmatch_idist</tt>,
or implicitly, with <tt>dmatch_ipos</tt>.

<p>
The matches are returned by iterative calls to function
<tt>dmatch_nextmatch</tt>.  Each returned match will satisfy
the constraint requirements on the distances of matched features.
Additional requirements on the matches can be set with functions
<tt>dmatch_matchsize</tt>,
<tt>dmatch_cessential</tt>,
<tt>dmatch_cimap</tt>,
and <tt>dmatch_icmap</tt>.

<p><a name="dmatch_open"></a></p>
<p><hr noshade="noshade" />

<pre>
qkey = <span class="fcndef">dmatch_open</span> []
</pre>

<p>
Opens a new query.  The return value must be used by all
subsequent <tt>dmatch_..</tt> functions.  Any number of queries can
be open at the same time.  Each query is "attached" to the task
that opened it.  When the task terminates, any attached opened
queries are automatically closed.
Programs should contain an explicit
<tt>dmatch_close</tt> for each <tt>dmatch_open</tt>.

<p><a name="dmatch_open"></a></p>
<p><hr noshade="noshade" />

<pre>
qkey = <span class="fcndef">dmatch_open</span> qkey
</pre>
<p>
Reopens an existing query and attaches it to the current task
(without breaking attachments to other tasks).
This functionality is useful when <tt>qkey</tt> was opened in another
task that could terminate while the query is still needed.
The termination of that task would close the query.
By reopening the query in the current task we can leave the query
open and available to the current task.
Programs should contain an explicit
<tt>dmatch_close</tt> for each <tt>dmatch_open</tt>.

<p><a name="dmatch_matchsize"></a></p>
<p><hr noshade="noshade" />

<pre>
<span class="fcndef">dmatch_matchsize</span> [qkey, n]
</pre>
<p>
Specifies the minimum number of pairs of features that
must be matched for the match to be returned by <tt>dmatch_nextmatch</tt>.

If <tt>n</tt> is positive, it indicates the minimum number of
features that must be matched.
If <tt>n</tt> is non-positive, it indicates the maximum number of
features that do not have to be matched, i.e.,
if the constraint has <tt>K</tt> features, the minimum number of
features that must be matched is (<tt>K-|n|</tt>).
The default value of <tt>n</tt> for a new query is 0, i.e., all
features have to be matched.

This function resets the query.

<p><a name="dmatch_cessential"></a></p>
<p><hr noshade="noshade" />

<pre>
<span class="fcndef">dmatch_cessential</span> [qkey, [cidx1, cidx2, ...]]
</pre>
<p>
Specifies features of the constraint that must be present
in every match returned by <tt>dmatch_nextmatch</tt>.
The features are specified by their numbers.
The default set of essential features is empty,
i.e., no constraint feature is essential.

This function resets the query.


<p><a name="dmatch_cdist"></a></p>
<p><hr noshade="noshade" />

<pre>
<span class="fcndef">dmatch_cdist</span> [qkey, SD_min, SD_max]
</pre>

<p>
Specifies the minimum and maximum distance associated
with each pair of constraint features.
The square, symmetric matrices <tt>SD_min</tt> and <tt>SD_max</tt>
store the <i>squares</i> of the minimum and maximum distances, respectively.

This function resets the query.

<p>Note:
There is no default value for the minimum and maximum constraint
distances: the values must be initialized either explicitly with
<tt>dmatch_cdist</tt> or implicitly with <tt>dmatch_cpos</tt>.

<p><a name="dmatch_cpos"></a></p>
<p><hr noshade="noshade" />

<pre>
<span class="fcndef">dmatch_cpos</span> [qkey, [x,y...], rad]
</pre>
<p>
Implicitly specifies the minimum and maximum distance associated
with each pair of constraint features.

The features are assumed to be spheres in Euclidean space
of given positions, <tt>[x,y...]</tt>, and radii, <tt>rad</tt>.
The minimum and maximum distances between two features are calculated
as the minimum and maximum distances between points on the spheres.

This function resets the query.

<p>Note: The Euclidean space can be of any dimension.

<p>Note:
There is no default value for the minimum and maximum constraint
distances: the values must be initialized either explicitly with
<tt>dmatch_cdist</tt> or implicitly with <tt>dmatch_cpos</tt>.

<p><a name="dmatch_cimap"></a></p><p><hr noshade="noshade" />
<pre>
<span class="fcndef">dmatch_cimap</span> [qkey, [iidxlist1, iidxlist2, ...]]
</pre>
<p>
Specifies which features of the constraint and instance are
to be considered for the match.
For each constraint feature, <i>i</i>, the function expects
a list of instance features, <tt>iidxlist</tt><i>i</i>,
that can match <i>i</i>.

By default, the lists are empty, resulting in
no matches being reported.

This function resets the query.

<p><a name="dmatch_icmap"></a></p><p><hr noshade="noshade" />
<pre>
<span class="fcndef">dmatch_icmap</span> [qkey, [cidxlist1, cidxlist2, ...]]
</pre>
<p>
Specifies which features of the constraint and instance are
to be considered for the match.
For each instance feature, <i>i</i>, the function expects
a list of constraint features, <tt>cidxlist</tt><i>i</i>,
that can match <i>i</i>.

By default, the lists are empty, resulting in
no matches being reported.

This function resets the query.

<p><a name="dmatch_idist"></a></p>
<p><hr noshade="noshade" />

<pre>
<span class="fcndef">dmatch_idist</span> [qkey, SD]
</pre>
<p>
Specifies the distance associated
with each pair of instance features.
The square, symmetric matrix <tt>SD</tt>
stores the <i>squares</i> of the distances.

This function resets the query.

<p>Note:
There is no default value for the instance distances: the
values must be initialized either explicitly with <tt>dmatch_idist</tt>
or implicitly with <tt>dmatch_ipos</tt>.

<p><a name="dmatch_ipos"></a></p>
<p><hr noshade="noshade" />

<pre>
<span class="fcndef">dmatch_ipos</span> [qkey, [x,y,z]]
</pre>
<p>
Implicitly specifies the distance associated
with each pair of instance features.

The features are assumed to be points in Euclidean space
of given positions, <tt>[x,y...]</tt>.
The distance between two features is calculated
as the distance between the points.

Internally, each distance is calculated only when it is
necessary for finding the match.  Therefore, it is generally
more efficient to use <tt>dmatch_ipos</tt>
than to pre-calculate all instance distances and use
<tt>dmatch_idist</tt>.

This function resets the query.

<p>Note: The Euclidean space can be of any dimension.

<p>Note:
There is no default value for the instance distances: the
values must be initialized either explicitly with <tt>dmatch_idist</tt>
or implicitly with <tt>dmatch_ipos</tt>.

<p><a name="dmatch_nextmatch"></a></p>
<p><hr noshade="noshade" />

<pre>
[iidx1, iidx2, ...] = <span class="fcndef">dmatch_nextmatch</span> qkey
</pre>

<p> Returns the next match from the specified query.  Each match is a
list of <i>K</i> indices, where <i>K</i> is the number of constraint
features.  Each index is either the instance feature that matches the
corresponding constraint feature, or it is 0, indicating that the
constraint feature was not matched.  When there are no matches or all
matches have been returned, the function returns the empty vector.

Example:

<pre>
    while length (qm = dmatch_nextmatch qkey) loop
	cidx = x_pack qm;	// matched constraint features
	iidx = pack qm;		// matching instance features
    endloop
</pre>

<p><a name="dmatch_reset"></a></p>
<p><hr noshade="noshade" />

<pre>
<span class="fcndef">dmatch_reset</span> qkey
</pre>

<p>
Resets the query object back to the state ready to emit the first match.
The next call to <tt>dmatch_nextmatch</tt> will return the first match.

<p><a name="dmatch_break"></a></p>
<p><hr noshade="noshade" />

<pre>
<span class="fcndef">dmatch_break</span> qkey
</pre>
<p>
Sets the query object to the state after reporting the last match.
The next call to <tt>dmatch_nextmatch</tt> will return the empty vector.

<p><a name="dmatch_timeout"></a></p>
<p><hr noshade="noshade" />

<pre>
<span class="fcndef">dmatch_timeout</span> [qkey, new_delay]
delay = <span class="fcndef">dmatch_timeout</span> qkey
delay = <span class="fcndef">dmatch_timeout</span> [qkey, new_delay]
</pre>
<p>
Returns the current timeout value for
<tt>dmatch_nextmatch</tt>, and
(optionally) sets a new timeout value.
The timeout value is the approximate delay, in seconds, after which
the <tt>dmatch_nextmatch</tt> function is forced to stop its execution.
If the <tt>new_delay</tt> argument is positive,
<tt>dmatch_nextmatch</tt> will report an error.
If the <tt>new_delay</tt> argument is negative,
<tt>dmatch_nextmatch</tt> will return with an empty vector.
The default timeout value is 5, i.e., if the function cannot
reach any conclusion in 5 seconds, it will report an error.

This function does not reset the query.

<p>Note: The <tt>dmatch_nextmatch</tt> function will test at least
2<sup>24</sup> possible mappings between the constraint features and the
instance features before checking whether the timeout has been reached.

<p><a name="dmatch_close"></a></p>
<p><hr noshade="noshade" />

<pre>
<span class="fcndef">dmatch_close</span> qkey
</pre>
<p>
Closes (destroys) a given query.
Unlike other <tt>dmatch_...</tt> functions, this function
produces no error if <tt>qkey</tt> is not a valid query.
Programs should contain a
<tt>dmatch_open</tt> for each <tt>dmatch_close</tt>.

<p><hr noshade="noshade" />
<b>Example:</b>

<p>The following code generates all permutations of numbers 1 to 5:

<pre>
    local idx, qkey = <span class="fcndef">dmatch_open</span> [];

    <span class="fcndef">dmatch_cimap</span> [qkey, rep [igen 5, 5]];
    <span class="fcndef">dmatch_cdist</span> [qkey, rep [0, 5, 5], 0];
    <span class="fcndef">dmatch_idist</span> [qkey, rep [0, 5, 5]];

    while length (idx = <span class="fcndef">dmatch_nextmatch</span> qkey) loop
	print idx;
    endloop

    <span class="fcndef">dmatch_close</span> qkey;
</pre>

<p><hr noshade="noshade" />
<b>Example:</b>

<p>Consider two graphs G1 and G2, with vertex labels L1 and L2. It is possible to
use distance matching to find candidate mappings for cases where G1 is a
subgraph of G2:

<pre>
    local L1 = ['C', 'C', 'N'];
    local G1 = [[2,3], 1, 2];
    local D1 = graph_distance G1;

    local L2 = ['C', 'C', 'N', 'C'];
    local G2 = [[2,3], [1,3], [1,2,4], 3];
    local D2 = graph_distance G2;

    local qkey = <span class="fcndef">dmatch_open</span> [];

    <span class="fcndef">dmatch_cdist</span> [qkey, 1, D1];
    <span class="fcndef">dmatch_idist</span> [qkey, D2];
    <span class="fcndef">dmatch_cimap</span> [qkey, indicesof [L1, L2]];

    local qm;
    while length (qm = <span class="fcndef">dmatch_nextmatch</span> qkey) loop

    	// ...do something with the result...

    endloop

    <span class="fcndef">dmatch_close</span> qkey;
</pre>

<p>In each iteration, the variable <tt>qm</tt> contains a mapping
between the vertices of G1 and the vertices of G2: each vertex
<tt>i</tt> in G1 is matched with vertex <tt/>qm(i)</tt> in G2.  The
mapped vertices of graph G2 induce a subgraph, G3, which has the same
vertices as G1 and a superset of edges of G1:

<pre>
    G3 = graph_get [G2, qm];
</pre>

<p>To find out which edges occur only in G3 but not in G1, we can
compare the adjacency matrices of both graphs:

<pre>
    m = graph_adjacency G3 and not graph_adjacency G1;
    [e1A, e1B] = graph_uedges app x_pack m;
    [e2A, eq2B] = [qm[e1A], qm[e1B]];
</pre>

<p>Mask <tt>m</tt> is the adjacency matrix of graph G3 from which we
removed all edges that also occur in G1.  Variables
<tt>e1A</tt>,&nbsp;<tt>e1B</tt> store the remaining edges in G1
(or&nbsp;G3) as a laminated list of pairs of vertex indices.  Variables
<tt>e2A</tt>,&nbsp;<tt>e2B</tt> store the corresponding edges in G2.

<p>Note: since we do not use positions, we do not need to square
distances passed to <tt>dmatch_cdist</tt> and <tt>dmatch_idist</tt>.

<p>Note: The lower bound on distances in <tt>dmatch_cdist</tt> must be
1, not <tt>D1</tt>, because of the following subtle property.  The
shortest paths connecting two vertices of the matched subgraph in G2 may
all contain vertices that do not belong to the subgraph; to connect such
two vertices of the subgraph in the shortest way, we must travel outside
the subgraph.  If we restrict ourselves only to paths within the matched
subgraph, the shortest path between the two vertices will get longer.  The
two vertices will therefore be closer to each other in G2 than in G1, or,
in other words, smaller distances in G2 can match bigger distances in
G1.

<p>Note: In terms of the graph theory, G1 is <i>homomorphic</i> to G2
and G1 is a <i>factor</i> (or a <i>spanning subgraph</i>) of G3.
The above example solves the <i>subgraph isomorphism</i> problem,
which is known to be <i>NP-complete</i> for general graphs, i.e.
(most likely) not having any efficient (polynomial time) general
solution.

<p><hr noshade="noshade" />
<b>Example:</b>

<p>
Consider a set of features defined by positions of atoms N, O, P, and S.
The following code extracts the set of "receptor" features from the molecule
in the main window and compares them to the set of "ligand" features
extracted from each molecule in the molecular database
<tt>'$MOE/sample/mol/mref.mdb'</tt>.
We find all ligands whose features match almost all receptor features.
For each such ligand we print out its number and the features that match.

<pre>
local function LigandMatch []

	// Generate the receptor features from the molecule
	// in the main window and initiate the query

    local idx = indexof [aName Atoms[], ['N','O','P','S']];
    local [rec_type, rec_pos] = [pack idx, aPos (Atoms[] | idx)];

    local qkey = <span class="fcndef">dmatch_open</span> [];
    <span class="fcndef">dmatch_cpos</span> [qkey, rec_pos, 0.5];
    <span class="fcndef">dmatch_matchsize</span> [qkey, -1];	// All features except 1 must match

	// Open and scan the database.  For each entry of the database,
	// extract features of the ligand, match features of the receptor
	// with those of the ligand and report all matches found.

    local dbkey = db_Open '$MOE/sample/mol/mref.mdb';
    local ent = 0;

    local i;

<p>The above example assumes that matches are allowed only
between features of the same type.
The following modification
allows matches between features that are of "compatible types".

<b>Example:</b>

<p>The distance matching functions must be used with caution.  The
<tt>dmatch_nextmatch</tt> function attempts to systematically examine a
great number of possible matchings and its cost may become prohibitive
even for small-sized problems.

<p> The following code forces <tt>dmatch_nextmatch</tt> to examine
exponential number of possibilities before returning with no match found.
For sufficiently large N, the function will time out.

<pre>
    local N = 20;
    local x = resize [[0,1], N];

    local idx, qkey = <span class="fcndef">dmatch_open</span> [];

    <span class="fcndef">dmatch_cimap</span> [qkey, rep [x_id N, N]];
    <span class="fcndef">dmatch_cpos</span> [qkey, [x], 0.001];
    <span class="fcndef">dmatch_ipos</span> [qkey, [x + 0.1 * m_last x]];

    print <span class="fcndef">dmatch_nextmatch</span> qkey; // times out

    <span class="fcndef">dmatch_close</span> qkey;
</pre>
