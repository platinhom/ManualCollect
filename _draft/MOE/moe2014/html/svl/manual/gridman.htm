<a name="Introduction"></a>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
An SVL grid is a multi-dimensional rectangular lattice of field values,
together with their associated lattice coordinates.  Grids can be used,
for instance, to perform calculations on potential fields or to draw
surfaces.  MOE provides a set of SVL functions that simplify the SVL grid
manipulations.  Their functionality provides for</p>

<ul>
<li>Multi-dimensional grid creation and manipulation</li>
<li>Gaussian density sampling</li>
<li>Off-grid interpolation</li>
<li>Color interpolation</li>
<li>On- and off-grid derivative calculation</li>
<li>Iso-surface point, line, and triangle generation</li>
<li>Wireframe and solid surface rendering</li>
</ul>


<p>An SVL grid is stored as a pair of vectors: a <i>data vector</i> and a
<i>shape vector</i>.  The data vector is a flat numeric vector that
contains values of the field at each gridpoint. The shape vector
specifies the gridpoint coordinates.  The lattice defined by the
gridpoints is rectangular, with either uniform or non-uniform spacing.</p>

<a name="GridGeneration"></a>
<h2>Creating Grids</h2>

<p>Creating a grid consists of creating both a shape vector
and a data vector.</p>

<p>The shape vector stores gridpoint positions along each dimension. 
The number of dimensions must be between 2 and 24 with each dimension
containing at least 2 points.
Each
element of the shape vector is a flat vector of strictly increasing grid
positions along the corresponding dimension.  The values of the field at
the gridpoints are stored in row-major order, i.e. with the index
of the last dimension changing most rapidly.</p>

<p><b>1D Example.</b>
For example, consider a 1D field <i>F</i> sampled at three points
<i>x</i>=1.2, 2.2, 3.7:</p>

<div style="text-align:center">
<table border="1" cellpadding="2" 
style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; text-align:center">
<tr class="titlebar">
	<th bgcolor="#cccccc">Coordinate <i>x</i></th>
	<th bgcolor="#cccccc">Value <i>F</i>(<i>x</i>)</th>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>1.2</td><td>7</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>2.2</td><td>9</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>3.7</td><td>11</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>The grid of the above field is stored as:</p>

<pre>
    shape = [ [1.2,2.2,3.7] ];	// x
    data = [7,9,11];		// F(x)
</pre>

<p><b>2D Example.</b>
As a second example, consider a 2D field <i>F</i>(<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>)
sampled at six points arranged in a 2&times;3 matrix:</p>

<p>
<blockquote>
<i>F</i>(<i>x<sub>i</sub></i>,<i>y<sub>j</sub></i>) =
<i>f</i><sub><i>ij</i></sub>,
where <i>i</i>=1..2, <i>j</i>=1..3.
</blockquote>

<div style="text-align:center">
<table border="1" cellpadding="5" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;">
<tr bgcolor="#e0e0e0">
    <td>  </td>
    <td><b>y<sub>1</sub></b></td>
    <td><b>y<sub>2</sub></b></td>
    <td><b>y<sub>3</sub></b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <th bgcolor="#e0e0e0">x<sub>1</sub></th>
    <td>f<sub>11</sub></td>
    <td>f<sub>12</sub></td>
    <td>f<sub>13</sub></td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <th bgcolor="#e0e0e0">x<sub>2</sub></th>
    <td>f<sub>21</sub></td>
    <td>f<sub>22</sub></td>
    <td>f<sub>23</sub></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>The grid of the above field is stored as:</p>

<blockquote>
<tt>    shape = [ [x<sub>1</sub>,x<sub>2</sub>], [y<sub>1</sub>,y<sub>2</sub>,y<sub>3</sub>] ];<br />
    data = [f<sub>11</sub>,f<sub>12</sub>,f<sub>13</sub>,f<sub>21</sub>,f<sub>22</sub>,f<sub>23</sub>];   
		// y dimension changes most rapidly</tt>
</blockquote>

<a name="ShapeVector"></a>
<h3>Shape Vector</h3>

<p>An SVL grid does not have its gridpoint coordinates exhaustively
specified.  For example, a lattice whose gridpoint coordinates are:</p>

<div style="margin:0 auto 0 auto; text-align:center">
<table border="1" cellpadding="2" style="margin:0 auto 0 auto;">
  <tr>
    <td>(0,1)</td>
    <td>(0,2)</td>
    <td>(0,3)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>(1,1)</td>
    <td>(1,2)</td>
    <td>(1,3)</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>
would not be given as six pairs of numbers, but rather as an <i>x</i>
and a <i>y</i> vector:</p>

<pre>
    x = [0,1];
    y = [1,2,3];
    shape = [x,y];	// gridpoint coordinate specification
</pre>

<p>
The SVL function <tt>grid_coord</tt> can be used to return the exhaustive
list of coordinates (for more about grid coordinate transformations,
please see the section on <a href="#AccessingGridDataCoords">Accessing
grid data and coordinates</a>).</p>

<p>For example, given a grid shape:</p>

<pre>
    x = [0,1];
    y = [1,2,3];
</pre>

<p>the following code will set <tt>coords</tt> to contain all six coordinates,
specified by the 'igen 6' argument, as <span class="nobr">[x_values, y_values]</span>:</p>

<pre>
    coords = grid_coord [ [x,y], igen 6 ];
</pre>

<p>The resulting value of <tt>coords</tt> is:</p>
<pre>
    [ [0,0,0,1,1,1], [1,2,3,1,2,3] ]
</pre>

<p>Generating a shape vector consists of creating coordinate vectors along
each of the <i>n</i> dimensions of an <i>n</i>-dimensional lattice. The
intervals between the coordinates need not be regular.  To generate the
shape vector, you need the origin of the lattice and the length of
each side of the lattice, along with the coordinate spacings in each
dimension.</p>

<p>Consider, for example, a uniform 2D lattice in a rectangular region
whose lower left corner is
<tt>c1</tt>=(<i>x</i><sub>1</sub>,<i>y</i><sub>1</sub>) and whose upper
right corner is <tt>c2</tt>=(<i>x</i><sub>2</sub>,<i>y</i><sub>2</sub>).
The following function generates uniform (square) gridpoint
positions on such a lattice.  In it, the distance in either dimension
between adjacent gridpoints is given by the integer function argument
<tt>spacing</tt>.  The <tt>size</tt> variable stores the number
of gridpoints in each dimension.  Variable <tt>shape</tt> stores the
resulting gridpoint coordinates in each dimension:</p>

<a name="generate_shape"></a>
<pre>
    function generate_shape [c1, c2, spacing]

	    // calculate number of intervals 
	    // between gridpoints in
	    // each dimension; round upwards using ceil

	local num_intervals = ceil ((c2 - c1) / spacing);

	    // number of gridpoints = number of intervals + 1
	    // num_gridpoints = [num_x, num_y]

	local num_gridpoints = inc num_intervals;

	    // size = [size_x, size_y]
	    // enforce a minimum of 2 gridpoints 
	    // in each dimension

	local size = maxE [2, num_gridpoints];

	    // app igen size: generates consecutive
	    // integer indices
	    //    [ [1..size_x], [1..size_y] ]
	    // dec app igen size: generates 
	    // consecutive integer indices
	    //    [ [0..size_x-1], [0..size_y-1] ]
	    // c1 is origin of lattice
 
	local shape = c1 + dec app igen size * spacing;
	return shape;
    endfunction
</pre>

<p>If <tt>c1=[2,4]</tt>, <tt>c2=[10,6]</tt>, and the desired spacing
is 2, then the <tt>shape</tt> generated is:</p>

<pre>
    svl> generate_shape [ [2,4], [10,6], 2 ]
	[[2,4,6,8,10], [4,6]]
</pre>

<p>The above code is not restricted to two dimensions; it works for any
arbitrary number of dimensions.  For instance:</p>

<pre>
    svl> generate_shape [ [2,4,6], [10,6,12], 2 ]
	[[2,4,6,8,10], [4,6], [6,8,10,12]]
</pre>

<a name="DataVector"></a>
<h3>Data Vector</h3>

<p>The values of the field at the gridpoints are stored in a data vector.
There must be one data value for every gridpoint.  The length of the data
vector must therefore equal the product of the number of gridpoints
along each dimension.  In other words,</p>

<pre>
    length data === mul app length shape
</pre>

<p>
Suppose you have an SVL function called <tt>calc_field</tt> that
calculates field values at specified coordinates (passed as the function
argument).  The following code fragment generates field samples at all
gridpoints of a lattice and stores them into the data vector
<tt>data</tt>.  Variable <tt>ndata</tt> stores the total number of
gridpoints in the grid.  Variable <tt>coord</tt> stores the coordinates of
all gridpoints.  The <tt>size</tt> variable gives the number of
gridpoints in each of the <i>n</i> dimensions of the <i>n</i>-dimensional
lattice.  The SVL function <tt>grid_coord</tt> returns the gridpoint
coordinates associated with the data.</p>

<pre>
    local ndata = mul size;
    local coord = grid_coord [shape, igen ndata];
    local data = calc_field coord;
</pre>

<p>Grid values can be accessed and modified directly with SVL operators.
For example, to increase all grid values by 0.3:</p>

<pre>
    data = data + 0.3;
</pre>

<p>
Grid values can also be manipulated using the built-in SVL grid
functions, which are described below.</p>

<a name="AccessingGridDataCoords"></a>
<h2>Accessing Grid Data and Coordinates</h2>

<p>
It is often necessary to access a subset of all values on a grid.  For
instance, you may need to set values at the boundaries of a lattice
separately from those in the interior of the lattice.  To access a
particular grid value requires being able to determine, given a gridpoint
coordinate, the <i>index</i> of the associated field value in the grid
data vector.  The gridpoint coordinate is specified by indices into the
grid shape vector.</p>

<p>
You may also need to do the reverse operation: for a given set of grid
data values, find the grid coordinates.  In other words, given a grid
value, specified by an index into the grid data vector, calculate the
indices into the grid shape vector of the corresponding gridpoint
coordinate.</p>

<a name="SingleIndexMultipleIndexRepresentations"></a>
<h4>Single Index and Multiple Index Representations</h4>

<p>
A grid data vector is indexed by a <i>single index</i>.  By single
we mean that a scalar index is sufficient for extracting one value
from the data vector.  This is the result of the data vector being flat.
In contrast, a grid shape vector is indexed by a <i>multiple index</i>.
By multiple index we mean that a set of indices is needed to specify a
single gridpoint coordinate.  This is the result of the shape vector being
composed of a set of vectors, one per lattice dimension.</p>

<p>
Consider, for example, the following grid:</p>

<pre>
    data = [10,20,30,40,50,60];
    x = [2,3];
    y = [0,3,5];
    shape = [x,y];
</pre>

<p>
The single index vector for extracting data value <tt>30</tt> is simply:</p>

<pre>
    sidx = 3;
</pre>

<p>
whereas the multiple index vector for specifying the corresponding
coordinate <tt>[2,5]</tt> is:</p>

<pre>
    midx = [1,3];
</pre>

<p>
Extracting the field value using the single index is accomplished with:</p>

<pre>
    svl> peek [data, sidx]
      30
</pre>

<p>
The coordinate of the associated gridpoint is obtained using the
multiple index:</p>

<pre>
    svl> apt peek [shape, midx]
      [2,5]
</pre>

<p>
To make correspondences between gridpoint coordinates and their associated
field values, you need to convert between single index and multiple index
representations.  This conversion can be done using the SVL functions
<tt>grid_m2s</tt> and <tt>grid_s2m</tt>.  <tt>grid_s2m</tt> converts
single indices into the multiple indices needed to extract the associated
gridpoint coordinates.  <tt>grid_m2s</tt> converts multiple indices into
the corresponding single indices.  Both of these functions take the size
of the lattice as their first argument.  The "size" is the number of
gridpoints in each of the <i>n</i> dimensions of an <i>n</i>-dimensional
lattice.</p>

<pre>
    size === app length shape
</pre>

<p>
Consider, for example, a vector of single indices:</p>

<pre>
    sindices = [3,5];
</pre>

<p>
The corresponding data values are extracted using</p>

<pre>
    svl> get [data, sindices]
      [30,50]
</pre>

<p>
The multiple indices of the associated gridpoints can be obtained using
<tt>grid_s2m</tt>:</p>

<pre>
    mindices = grid_s2m [ app length shape, sindices ];
</pre>

<p>
In this case, <tt>mindices</tt> is <tt>[ [1,2], [3,2] ]</tt>.
The coordinates of the gridpoints are:</p>

<pre>
    svl> apt get [shape, mindices]
      [ [2,3], [5,3] ]
</pre>

<p>
Equivalently, the function <tt>grid_coord</tt> returns the coordinates
associated with the set of single indices:</p>

<pre>
    svl> grid_coord [shape, sindices]
      [ [2,3], [5,3] ]
</pre>

<a name="ExtractingPartsOfGrid"></a>
<h4>Extracting Data from Parts of a Grid</h4>

<p>
Two common cases of partial grid data extraction are:<p>

  <ol>
  <li>Extracting values on a rectangular sub-grid</li>
  <li>Extracting values on the boundary points of a grid</li>
  </ol>

<p>
The SVL function <tt>grid_xbox</tt> can be used to get the data at all
gridpoints that lie within an <span class="nobr"><i>n</i>-dimensional</span> box.  
The coordinates
of two diametrically opposed corners of the box are required to define the
box.  Given these two points, <tt>grid_xbox</tt> returns the data vector
indices (single index representation) of the gridpoints that fall within
the box.</p>

<p>
Extracting the values at the boundary points of a grid requires
calculating either data vector indices of the boundary gridpoints or a
mask which yields the values at the boundaries when applied to the data
vector.  The following function illustrates how to calculate a mask for
extracting the boundary values; it then uses the mask to set the boundary
data values to zero.</p>

<p>
In the code, the variable <tt>midx</tt> stores the multiple indices of all
gridpoints.  Each gridpoint multiple index is a list of grid indices, one
per dimension.  A gridpoint is detected as being on the boundary if any
one of the indices in its multiple index points to either the first or the
last gridpoint coordinate in the associated dimension:</p>

<pre>
    index == 1 or index == size_in_this_dimension
</pre>

<p>
The variable <tt>bmask</tt> stores a mask of 1's and 0's, and is applied
to the data vector.  A 1 indicates that the corresponding value lies on
the grid boundary; a 0 indicates that the value is at a point in the grid
interior.  <tt>size</tt> is a vector of the number of gridpoints in each
dimension.  <tt>data</tt> is the grid data vector.</p>

<pre>
    function zero_out_boundary_values [size, data]

	    // Get multiple indices for every 
	    // gridpoint in the grid.
	    // (igen ndata generates single indices 
	    // for every grid value)

	local ndata = length data;
	local midx = grid_s2m [size, igen ndata];

	    // length midx === length size
	    // Each element of midx is of 
	    // length ndata.

	    // Generate data vector mask.

	local bmask = orE (midx == 1 or midx == size);

	    // Wherever bmask has a 1, replace 
	    // corresponding element in data by a 0.

	data | bmask = 0;
	return data;
    endfunction
</pre>

<p>
Suppose we have a 3&times;4 grid of values
<tt>[10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90,100,110,120]</tt>.  The function returns
the following:</p>

<pre>
    svl> data = 10 * igen 12
    svl> zero_out_boundary_values [ [3,4], data ]
      [0,0,0,0,0,60,70,0,0,0,0,0]
</pre>

<p>
The data indices of the grid boundary and the grid interior are given by
simple expressions (<tt>x_pack</tt> returns the index of each non-zero
value in its argument):</p>

<pre>
    local idx_boundary = x_pack bmask;
    local idx_interior = x_pack not bmask;
</pre>

<a name="GridDataInterpolation"></a>
<h2>Grid Data Interpolation</h2>

<p>
Field values and derivatives are often needed both at exact gridpoints
("on-grid") and at locations between gridpoints ("off-grid").  For
example, you may wish to calculate the color associated with an arbitrary
point in space given a grid of color values (<tt>grid_color_at</tt>), or
to create a finer or coarser sub-grid from a grid that was previously
calculated (<tt>grid_reshape</tt>), or to calculate gradients at a set of
points in space not necessarily coincident with gridpoints
(<tt>grid_grad_at</tt>).</p>

<p>
Built-in SVL grid functions perform interpolation on grid
values, given grid shape and data (field value at exact gridpoints)
vectors.  Functions are available to calculate off-grid field values as
well as on- and off-grid derivatives.  On-grid derivatives are
calculated as the derivatives of an interpolating quadratic polynomial
evaluated at the gridpoints.  Field and derivative values at off-grid
points are interpolated from on-grid values using multi-cubic
interpolation.</p>

<p>
On a K-dimensional grid, the interpolating formula is a K-multi-cubic
interpolator.  The term multi-cubic means that the formula is
cubic in the variable associated with a particular dimension if the
variables associated with all other dimensions are held constant.</p>

<p>
For a given sample point, the multi-cubic interpolator uses the field
values and derivatives at the sample point's 2<sup>K</sup> neighbors to
calculate the interpolated field value and/or derivatives at the sample
point.  The values of the field derivatives at the exact gridpoints are
calculated as derivatives of an interpolating quadratic function
evaluated at the gridpoints.  The quadratic interpolator is a polynomial
of K variables of maximum combined degree 2.  For example, for a 2D grid,
the interpolating polynomial is of the general form:</p>

<p style="text-align:center">
<i>f</i>(<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) =
<i>C<sub>xx</sub></i> <i>x</i><sup>2</sup> +
<i>C<sub>yy</sub></i> <i>y</i><sup>2</sup> +
<i>C<sub>xy</sub></i> <i>x</i> <i>y</i> +
<i>C<sub>x</sub></i> <i>x</i> +
<i>C<sub>y</sub></i> <i>y</i> +
<i>C</i><sub>0</sub>
</p>

<p>Both the multi-cubic and the quadratic interpolating formulae assume
that the respective interpolating polynomials coincide with the field
values every gridpoint and at each gridpoint's <span class="nobr">2<sup>K</sup></span>
neighbors (two on each axis). The off-grid derivatives are obtained by taking derivatives of the
multi-cubic interpolation. </p>

<p>
The built-in SVL grid functions for interpolating data values divide into
two groups: those that end in <tt>_at</tt> and those that do not.  The
<tt>_at</tt> ending is a mnemonic and an abbreviation for "at
arbitrary point," i.e. functions that calculate off-grid values.
For example, <tt>grid_laplace</tt> calculates the values of the field
Laplacian at exact gridpoints of a grid, and <tt>grid_laplace_at</tt>
calculates the values of the field Laplacian at selected points in space,
inside or outside the grid boundaries.</p>

<p>
Three kinds of computations involving differentiation are supported:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Gradient:
  <p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="gridman/image123.gif" alt="gradient" /></p>
</li>
  <li>Laplacian:<br />
  <p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="gridman/image124.gif" alt="laplacian" />
</p>
</li>
<li>Partial derivative:<br />
  <p style="text-align:center;">
	<img src="gridman/image125.gif" alt="partial derivative" />
</p>
</li>
  </ul>

<a name="GridExamplePoissonsEquations"></a>
<h4>Grid Example: Poisson's Equation</h4>

<p>
Poisson's equation of a field <i>U</i> can be expressed as:</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="gridman/image126.gif" alt="Poisson" />
</p>

<p>where <i>f</i> is the charge density.</p>

<p>There is an implicit summation over all <i>i</i>'s.  The Jacobi diffusion
method solves the Poisson equation by time-propagating an initial field
value:</p>

<p style="text-align:center">
<img src="gridman/image127.gif" alt="Jacobi" />
<p>

<p>where <i>h</i> is the time step and <i>t</i> is the time at the current
iteration.</p>

<p>To implement the Jacobi diffusion method, we can use the SVL grid
function <tt>grid_laplace</tt> to calculate the residual
d<sup>2</sup><i>U</i>/d<i>x</i><sub><i>i</i></sub><sup>2</sup>. Once this
residual is calculated, standard SVL operators ("<tt>*</tt>" and
"<tt>+</tt>") can be used to combine it with time step <i>h</i> to
calculate the new value of <i>U</i>.</p>

<p>
The following SVL code fragment implements the Jacobi iterations.  It
assumes a grid with shape vector <tt>shape</tt>:</p>

<pre>
    local U = ...               // initial vector
    local h = ...               // some time increment
    local f = ...               // density

    for i = 1, MAX_ITERATIONS loop
        residual = grid_laplace [U, shape] + f;

	    // terminate diffusion if 
	    // magnitude of residual small enough

        if max abs residual < 0.001 then break; endif
        U = U + h * residual;
    endloop
</pre>

<a name="GaussianUpdate"></a>
<h2>Gaussian Update</h2>

<p>
Usually, when preparing grid data values, you set and modify values
in the grid data vector directly.  When a field is Gaussian, however, you
call <tt>grid_addgauss</tt> to perform the update of grid data for
you. Gaussian forms are separable (can
be calculated from independent computations along each dimension), and can
therefore be computed with high efficiency.</p>

<p>An <i>N</i>-dimensional Gaussian density is a generalization of a 1D
Gaussian of the form:</p>

<blockquote>

where <i>u</i> is the mean, <i>s<sup>2</sup></i> is the variance

<p>
<tt>grid_addgauss</tt> adds samples of a weighted Gaussian density
function of standard deviation <tt>sigma</tt> (calculated inside a sphere
of radius <tt>radius</tt> centered at <tt>center</tt>) to a grid defined by
<tt>shape</tt> and <tt>data</tt> vectors; <tt>weight</tt> is a
multiplicative constant:</p>

    grid_addgauss [data, shape, weight, sigma, center, radius]

<p>
This function is vectorized, i.e. <tt>weight</tt>, <tt>sigma</tt>,
<tt>center</tt>, and <tt>radius</tt> are vectors defining <i>n</i>
Gaussian densities.  At each gridpoint within <tt>radius</tt> of
<tt>center</tt>, samples from all <i>n</i> densities are added to the grid
data value.</p>

<a name="GaussianUpdateExample"></a>
<h4>Gaussian Update Example</h4>

<p>
The following function illustrates how to use <tt>grid_addgauss</tt>.  It
creates a Gaussian density field around a set of balls whose positions
<tt>pos</tt> and radii <tt>rad</tt> are passed as function arguments.  The
parameters <tt>weight</tt> and <tt>sigma</tt> are chosen such that the
level 1.0 <a href="#Isosurfaces">iso-surface</a> of the field forms a
smooth surface around the set of balls.  The constant <tt>K</tt>
determines how closely the iso-surface will hug the surface of individual
balls (when <tt>K</tt> becomes too large, numerical errors affect the
quality of the surface). <tt>shape</tt> is the grid shape vector:</p>

<a name="generate_gaussian"></a>
<pre>
	// ball_pos is a vector of x, y, z vectors: [x,y,z]
	// ball_rad is a vector of ball radii

    function generate_gaussian [ shape, ball_pos, ball_rad ]
	const K = 1.6;	// larger K makes deeper 
                        // ridges between atoms

	local data = 0;                   // initialize grid data
	local gauss_rad = 4 * ball_rad;   // extent of Gaussian 
                                        // over the grid

	local sigma = ball_rad / K;	// sigma controls 
                                    // width of Gaussian
	local weight = cube (sqrt(2*PI)*sigma) * exp (0.5 * sqr K); 
                                    // scale factor

	data = grid_addgauss [data, shape, weight, sigma, ball_pos, gauss_rad];
	return data;
    endfunction
</pre>

<p>
Here is an example of the usage of this function, assuming three 2D balls
at positions [-2,0], [0,1], [2,3], and using the function
<a href="#generate_shape"><tt>generate_shape</tt></a> from above to
generate the grid shape vector:</p>

<pre>
    generate_gaussian [
        generate_shape [ [-5,-5], [5,5], 1 ],
        [ [-2,0,2], [0,1,3] ],
        [1.5, 2.5, 0.5]
    ];
</pre>

<p>
<tt>grid_maxgauss</tt> is another function which updates the
values of the data vector with a Gaussian of given parameters and weight.
Now, however, the value of the data is set to the maximum of the Gaussian
samples and the original data rather than the sum.  To illustrate how to
use <tt>grid_maxgauss</tt>, replace the lines of code in
<tt>generate_gaussian</tt> that assign values to <tt>K</tt> and
<tt>data</tt> with the following two lines of code:</p>

<pre>
    const K = 1.0;
	...
    data = grid_maxgauss [data, shape, weight, sigma, ball_pos, gauss_rad];
</pre>

<p>
The result is a Gaussian field whose level 1.0 iso-surface sits exactly on
the surface of each individual ball.</p>

<a name="Isosurfaces"></a>
<h2>Iso-surfaces</h2>

<p>
One of the primary uses of grids is the generation of iso-surfaces.  An
iso-surface is an <i>N</i>-dimensional (usually 3D) surface joining
points of identical field value on an <i>N</i>-dimensional (usually 3D)
grid.  SVL's grid functionality provides functions for generating and
manipulating grid iso-contours and iso-surfaces of different kinds.</p>

<a name="RepresentingIsosurfaces"></a>
<h3>Representing Iso-surfaces</h3>

<p>
The function <tt>grid_iso</tt> generates a representation of an
iso-surface at a specified level (field value).  An SVL iso-surface is
represented as two vectors, a list of <i>iso-vertices</i> and a list
<i>iso-indices</i>.  Both lists are flat vectors of integers with special
markers that allow them to be processed into the 3D coordinates of the
line segments and the triangles needed for the different graphical
representations of the iso-surface.  When dealing with iso-surfaces, you
need not be concerned with the exact storage details of iso-vertices and
iso-indices as long as you manipulate them using the SVL iso-surface
functions (see <a href="#IsoverticesIsoindices">iso-vertices and
iso-indices</a> below).</p>

<p>
An iso-surface is generated over a grid using a 2D or 3D
<i>marching-cube</i> algorithm.  Marching-cube refers to the way in which
the grid is processed.  If a grid is thought of as an array of
rectangles (2D) or cubical volumes (3D), each rectangle or "cube" is
processed independently of any other rectangle or cube in the grid.  The
rectangles/cubes of the grid are traversed in sequence, hence
the notion of marching along the grid from cube to cube.  The order
in which the points of the iso-surface are then emitted follows the grid
traversal order.</p>

<p>
An iso-surface comprises a set of iso-vertices -- points of equal field
value. Each iso-vertex of an iso-surface lies on a grid line between two
neighboring gridpoints.  Iso-vertices are independently calculated in each
cubical volume of the grid.  The field values at the corners of each grid
cube are used to calculate the coordinates of the iso-vertices in that
cube.  The iso-vertices form a polygon.  By processing all cubes of a
grid, the marching-cube iso-surface generation algorithm produces a
complete list of the polygons connecting points of the same field value over
the entire grid.  The cubes in the grid are alternately labeled "even" and
"odd" so that polygons from alternate cubes can be eliminated, allowing
for checkered surfaces to be drawn.</p>

<a name="IsosurfaceDrawingModes"></a>
<h3>Iso-surface Drawing Modes</h3>

<p>
There are several different graphical representations of an iso-surface:
dot, line (iso-contours), mesh (two sets of perpendicularly oriented
iso-contours), and solid (iso-triangles).  Common to all are the
coordinates of the iso-vertices of the iso-surface.  The SVL function
<tt>grid_isovtx_coord</tt> converts iso-vertex values to 3D coordinates:</p>

<pre>
    points = grid_isovtx_coord [data, shape, isovtx, level, dims];
</pre>

<p>
The various surface drawing modes are merely different ways in which to
display the iso-vertices of the iso-surface.  If just the vertices are
drawn, a dot surface results.  Connecting the vertices by line segments
results in line and mesh drawings.  Connecting each set of the three nearest
vertices by a shaded triangle produces a solid surface rendering.  For
each drawing mode ("<tt>gtype</tt>"), a list of which vertices to connect
together (pairs if line segments, triplets if triangles) is generated
by the function <tt>grid_isoidx_emit</tt>.</p>

<p>
For a mesh surface, the coordinates of the <i>i</i>-th line segment are:</p>

<pre>
    apt get [ points, [[ 2*i-1, 2*i ]] ]
</pre>

<p>
For a solid surface, the coordinates of the <i>i</i>-th triangle are:</p>

<pre>
    apt get [ points, [[ 3*i-2, 3*i-1, 3*i ]] ]
</pre>

<p>
Special effects can be produced on solid surface renderings by
deleting shaded polygons from the surface.  This can be done using
the function <tt>grid_isoidx_drop</tt>.</p>

<a name="IsosurfaceNormals"></a>
<h4>Iso-surface Normals</h4>

<p>
Normals to an iso-surface can be calculated when the iso-surface type
is a 3D solid surface.  The function <tt>grid_isovtx_grad</tt> calculates
the field gradients at the points of an iso-surface.  By default the
triangles are generated in the positive (counter-clockwise) direction
about the gradient of the field.  If the triangles of the surface are
generated in reverse order (accomplished by setting the <tt>opt</tt>
argument to the function <tt>grid_isoidx_emit</tt>), the negative field
gradient will be used for the surface normal calculation.</p>

<a name="IsoverticesIsoindices"></a>
<h4>Iso-vertices and Iso-indices</h4>

<p>
Each iso-vertex and each iso-index contains an index value in its low-order 
bits and a set of markers in its high-order bits. The mask
<tt>GRID_ISO_VALUE</tt> can be used to strip out the high-order bits.</p>

<p>
The iso-vertex markers, <tt>GRID_ISO_X</tt>, <tt>GRID_ISO_Y</tt>, and
<tt>GRID_ISO_Z</tt>, specify on which axis an iso-vertex lies.  The
low-order bits of an iso-vertex contain the higher of the indices of its
two neighboring gridpoints.</p>

<p>
Each iso-index points to one iso-vertex.  A given iso-vertex may be
pointed to by more than one iso-index.  The low-order bits of each
iso-index contain an index into the list of iso-vertices.  The
higher-order bits of an iso-index store the iso-index type.  These bits
can be used to identify and process the polygons generated by the
marching-cube algorithm (grid
<a href="#IsosurfacesAtGridBoundaries">boundaries</a> are discussed
below):</p>

<table align="center" border="1" cellpadding="5">
<tr><td valign="top"><tt>GRID_ISO_POLY</tt></td>
    <td valign="top">Marks the beginning of each new polygon.</td>

    boundaries). </td>

</table>

<a name="IsosurfacesAtGridBoundaries"></a>
<h4>Iso-surfaces at Grid Boundaries</h4>

<p>
A 3D grid is bounded by six faces or <i>boundaries</i>.  Each of the six
boundaries of a 3D grid is perpendicular to one axis. Of the two
boundaries perpendicular to the same axis, the boundary of the smaller
grid coordinate along that axis is called the "front" boundary. The other
one is called the "rear" boundary.</p>

<p>
By default all boundaries of a grid are included in the iso-surface
calculation.  When generating a 3D mesh iso-surface, line segments on the
grid boundaries can be excluded by setting the <tt>opt</tt> argument to
the function <tt>grid_isoidx_emit</tt>.  <tt>opt</tt> is a vector of
integers.  The numbers 1, 2, and 3 correspond to front grid boundaries
perpendicular to the X, Y, and Z axes, respectively.  Numbers 4, 5, and 6
correspond to both front and rear boundaries perpendicular to X, Y, and Z,
respectively.</p>

<p>
Boundary omission is used when plotting surfaces over multiple adjacent
grids.</p>

<a name="IsosurfaceExample"></a>
<h3>Iso-surface Example</h3>

<p> The function <tt>draw_surf</tt> below illustrates the use of SVL
iso-surface functions. <tt>draw_surf</tt> generates an iso-surface of a
field at a given level.  The field is represented as the grid
<tt>[data,shape]</tt>, which is passed as a function argument.
</p>
<p>
<tt>draw_surf</tt> uses the following call to <tt>grid_iso</tt> to
calculate the iso-vertices of the iso-surface and the iso-indices that
point to those iso-vertices:</p>

<pre>
    local dims = [1,2,3];
    local [isovtx, isoidx] = grid_iso [data, shape, level, dims];
</pre>

<p>
For displaying the surface, both the coordinates of the iso-vertices and
the normals to the iso-surface at those points are needed.  Assuming a
Gaussian field, the normals are inverse gradients of the field.  The
coordinates are calculated with <tt>grid_isovtx_coord</tt>, and the field
gradients with <tt>grid_isovtx_grad</tt>:</p>

<pre>
    local points = grid_isovtx_coord [data, shape, isovtx, level, dims];
    local normals = - grid_isovtx_grad [data, shape, isovtx, level, dims];
</pre>

<p>
The function <tt>grid_isoidx_emit</tt> can be used to create either a list
of line segments of a mesh surface (<tt>gtype</tt>=2) or a list of
triangles of a solid surface (<tt>gtype</tt>=3).  In <tt>draw_surf</tt>, a
solid surface is drawn.  The <tt>opt</tt> parameter, when set to -1,
indicates that the surface normals are opposite to the field gradients:</p>

<pre>
    const gtype = 3;
    local opt = -1;
    local idx = grid_isoidx_emit [isoidx, gtype, opt];
</pre>

<p>
Variable <tt>idx</tt> is a list of indices into both the <tt>points</tt>
and <tt>normals</tt> vectors.</p>

<p>
To achieve a checkered pattern appearance of the solid surface, we can
remove surface data from every second cube of the grid with the call
<tt>grid_isoidx_drop</tt>:</p>

<pre>
    isoidx = grid_isoidx_drop [isoidx,0];
    idx = grid_isoidx_emit [isoidx, gtype, -1];
</pre>

<p>
The actual rendering of the graphical surface is done with a call to
<tt>GVertex</tt>.</p>

<pre>
    function draw_surf [ [data,shape], level] // pass in grid, level

	const SURF_NAME = 'Checkered Surface';
	const SURF_COLOR = 0xffcc22;	// goldenrod

	local dims = [1,2,3];		// full 3D iso-surface
	local gtype = 3;		// solid surface
	local opt = -1;			// normals opposite to field gradients

	    // generate iso-vertices and iso-indices

	local [isovtx, isoidx] = grid_iso [data, shape, level, dims];

	    // convert iso-vertices into 3D coordinates; calculate normals

	local points = grid_isovtx_coord [data, shape, isovtx, level, dims];
	local normals = - grid_isovtx_grad [data, shape, isovtx, level, dims];

	    // generate indices idx into 'points' and 'normals' vectors;
	    // idx will be used for graphical rendering of the surface

	local idx = grid_isoidx_emit [isoidx, gtype, opt];

	    // make the surface checkered

	isoidx = grid_isoidx_drop [isoidx,0];
	idx = grid_isoidx_emit [isoidx, gtype, -1];

	GVertex  [GCreate SURF_NAME, gtype, idx, SURF_COLOR, points, normals];

    endfunction
</pre>

<p>
To run function <tt>draw_surf</tt>, we can make use of the functions
<tt>generate_shape</tt> and
<tt>generate_gaussian</tt> described
above.  We generate a grid of 1331 points whose two opposite corners are
[-5,-5,-5] and [5,5,5], and create a field comprising a Gaussian density
centered at [0,0,0].  We then use <tt>draw_surf</tt> to draw an
iso-surface of this field at level 0.05.</p>

<pre>
    svl> shape = generate_shape [ [-5,-5,-5], [5,5,5], 1 ]
    svl> data = generate_gaussian [ shape, [0,0,0], 1 ]
    svl> draw_surf [ [data, shape], 0.05 ]
</pre>
