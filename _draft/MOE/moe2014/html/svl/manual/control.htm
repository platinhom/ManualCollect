<p>Control flow statements dictate the order in which computations are
done. By default, statements are executed linearly, in the order in which
they appear in a program.  Conditional execution, looping and jump
statements alter the flow of a program, allowing certain pieces of code to
be by-passed, and others to be repeated.</p>

<p>Linear execution does not necessarily imply <i>sequential</i>
execution. In a multi-tasking SVL environment, a piece of code may run
concurrently with code that was invoked at an earlier time.</p>


<h2><a name="if Statement: Conditional Execution">if Statement: Conditional Execution</a></h2>

<p>The <tt>if</tt> statement is used to make a multi-way decision. A piece
of code is executed only <tt>if</tt> a certain condition is satisfied. The
optional <tt>elseif</tt> and <tt>else</tt> branches of the <tt>if</tt>
statement allow for alternative routes of possibly conditioned execution,
in the event that earlier conditions are not met. The formal syntax is
</p>

<pre>
    if <i>expr</i> then [<i>statement list</i>]
    [ elseif  <i>expr</i> then [<i>statement list</i>]
    ...
    [ else [<i>statement list</i>] ]
    endif
</pre>

<p>Here, square brackets [ ] enclose optional statements. There is no
limit on the number of <tt>elseif</tt> statements that may be present. The
<tt>if</tt>, <tt>then</tt> and <tt>endif</tt> keywords must all be
present. The terminating semi-colon may be omitted after the
<tt>endif</tt>.</p>

<p>The expression following the <tt>if</tt> is the condition being tested.
It is a boolean expression; furthermore, it must evaluate to a scalar.</p>

<p>The <tt>if</tt> statement is traversed in sequential order. As soon as
a condition is found to be true, the associated statement list is
executed, and the <tt>if</tt> statement terminated. Exactly one and only
one statement list is evaluated.</p>

<p>Here is an example of an <tt>if</tt> statement: </p>

<pre>
    if gradient &gt; 100000 then
	Opt_func [ method:'CG', gtest:1000 ];
    elseif gradient &lt; 0.1 then
	Opt_func [ gtest:0.00001 ];
    else
	Opt_func [ gtest:0.1 ];
    endif 
</pre>

<h2><a name="Looping">Looping</a></h2>

<p>In non-vector languages, loops are conventionally used to apply a fixed
set of statements against a collection of similar objects. In SVL, the
function <tt>app</tt> is employed for this purpose, and in such cases,
loops should be religiously avoided. Where loops are needed is in
implementations of iterative algorithms, or where the complexity of
manipulations warrants.</p>

<h3><a name="loop Statement">loop Statement</a></h3>

<p>The most general SVL loop construction is of the form: </p>

<pre>
    [ for   ... ]
        [ while <i>expr</i> ]
        ...
        [ while <i>expr</i> ]
        loop
           [<i>statement list</i>]
        [ until <i>expr</i> ]
        ...
        [ until <i>expr</i> ]
    endloop 
</pre>

<p>where the <tt>for</tt> construct is one of: </p>

<pre>
    for <i>expr</i>
    for <i>lvalue</i> in <i>expr</i>
    for <i>lvalue</i> = <i>start_expr</i>,<i>end_expr</i>[,<i>incr_expr</i>]
</pre>

<p>Looping is effected with the <tt>loop</tt> keyword. The set of
statements to be repeated is bracketed by the keywords <tt>loop</tt> and
<tt>endloop</tt>. The terminating semi-colon may be omitted after the
<tt>endloop</tt>.</p>

<p>Loop termination tests may be present at both start <i>and </i>end of a
loop. The <tt>for</tt>, <tt>while</tt> and <tt>until</tt> tests are all
optional. A plain <tt>loop-endloop</tt> sequence is an infinite loop. </p>

<pre>
    loop // infinite loop waits on a window
        local [values,trigger] = WindowWait [winkey,TRIGGERS];
        if values.(trigger) === 'Optimize' then
            Minimize [];
         endif 
    endloop
</pre>

<h3><a name="for Loop">for Loop</a></h3>

<p>The <tt>for</tt> loop has most commonly been used in non-vector
languages to step through a fixed-length data structure. We repeat that in
SVL, it should not be used for this purpose unless computations are of
high complexity.</p>

<p>The <tt>for</tt> loop has an explicit counter associated with it. The
starting, ending, and increment expressions (if any), are
evaluated only once, at the very start of the loop (this is in contrast to
<tt>while</tt>, which evaluates its termination condition expression at
every loop iteration).</p>

<p>There are 3 forms of <tt>for</tt> loop.</p>

<h3><a name="for-in Loop">for-in Loop</a></h3>

<pre>
    for <i>lvalue</i> in <i>expr</i> loop
        [<i>statement list</i>]
    endloop
</pre>

<p>The <tt>in</tt> reserved word causes each element of <i>lvalue</i> to
be assigned corresponding values in <i>expr</i> in sequence. <i>lvalue</i>
acts as a counter, and can be either a single variable or a vector of
variables. In this latter case, the number of values to be assigned should
be the same for each variable; if they are of different number,
nulls [] will be assigned to those variables having shortfalls. The values
to be assigned need not be numeric data. The loop terminates when there
are no more values to assign. Consider the following: </p>

<pre>
    for [a,b] in [ &quot;ab&quot;, &quot;cd&quot;, &quot;ef&quot; ] loop
        print [a,b];
    endloop
</pre>

<p>The result of this is:</p>

<pre>
    &quot;ab&quot;
    &quot;cd&quot;
    &quot;ef&quot; 
</pre>
   
<p>In the following example, the transpose function <tt>tr</tt> in the
<tt>for</tt> loop is needed to change the pair of lists of values to be
assigned into a list of pairs; each pair is then assigned to
<tt>[a,b]</tt>. 

<pre>
    v = &quot;abcde&quot;
    for [a,b] in tr [ x_id v, sort v ] loop
        print [a,b]; 
    endloop
</pre>



<p>The output is: </p>

<pre>
    [ 1, &quot;a&quot; ]
    [ 2, &quot;b&quot; ]
    [ 3, &quot;c&quot; ]
    [ 4, &quot;d&quot; ]
    [ 5, &quot;e&quot; ] 
</pre>

<h3><a name="for = Loop">for = Loop</a> </h3>

<pre>
    for <i>lvalue</i> = <i>start_expr</i>,<i>end_expr</i>[,<i>incr_expr</i>] loop
           [<i>statement list</i>] 

    endloop 
</pre>

<p>This is the vector analogue to a Fortran loop.<i> start_expr</i> is the
starting value of the counter <i>lvalue</i>, and <i>end_expr</i> the
termination value. Looping continues until <tt>abs</tt>
(<i>lvalue</i>-<i>end_expr</i>) &lt; <tt>e</tt>, where <tt>e</tt> is some
small number approaching <tt>EPS_M</tt>. <i>incr_expr</i> is an optional
increment, and can be both negative and non-integer. When the increment
parameter is omitted, <i>lvalue</i> is incremented by 1.</p>

<p>For example: </p>

<pre>
    for a = 10, 6, -1 loop
        print a;
    endloop 
</pre>

<p>produces the result: </p>

<pre>
    10
    9
    8
    7
    6 
</pre>

<h3><a name="for count Loop">for count Loop</a> </h3>

<pre>
    for <i>expr</i> loop
        [<i>statement list</i>] 
    endloop 
</pre>

<p>This is a shorthand version of the <tt>for =</tt> loop, with
<i>start_expr</i>=<i>count</i>, <i>end_expr</i>=0, and<i>incr_expr</i>=-1.
In other words, a fictitious counter counts down from <i>expr</i>, which
must evaluate to a scalar numeric value, and when it reaches zero, the
loop terminates. The value of <i>expr </i>cannot be accessed. </p>

<pre>
    for max_iterations loop
        ... minimization code, with termination check ... 
    endloop 
</pre>

<h3><a name="while Loop">while Loop</a></h3>

<p>The <tt>while</tt> loop, like the <tt>for</tt> <tt>loop</tt>, tests for
loop termination at the top of a loop. However, in the <tt>while</tt> loop
no explicit assignment is performed, although since the <tt>while
</tt>condition is an expression, it could also be an assignment.
Furthermore, <tt>while</tt> re-evaluates its termination condition
expression every iteration, whereas <tt>for</tt> does not (the expressions
are evaluated just once).</p>

<p>The syntax is: </p>

<pre>
    while <i>expr</i>
        ...
    while <i>expr</i> loop
        [<i>statement list</i>]
    endloop 
</pre>

<p>There is no limit on the number of <tt>while</tt> conditions present.
Multiple conditions are evaluated sequentially, and the loop terminates as
soon as one condition is found to be false. The reason <tt>for</tt> using
many <tt>while</tt> tests instead of an <tt>andL</tt> call is to permit
loop termination with the remaining condition expressions unevaluated.</p>

<p>Do not confuse a loop with multiple <tt>while</tt> conditions with multiply-nested
loops. A loop with three <tt>while</tt> conditions: </p>

<pre>
    while ...
    while ...
    while ... loop 
        ...
    endloop 
</pre>

<p>is a single loop with three termination conditions. Compare to: </p>

<pre>
    while ... loop
        while ... loop
            while ... loop
                ...
            endloop 
        endloop 
    endloop
</pre>

<p>which is a triply-nested set of loops each with a single termination
condition.</p>

<pre>
    // evaluate first order Bessel function J0(x) 

    local J0 = 1, term = 1, i = 0;
    local xx = sqr (x/2);

    while (i = inc i) &lt; MAX_ITERATIONS
    while abs term &gt; EPSILON
    loop
       term = -term * xx / sqr i;
       J0 = J0 + term; 
    endloop 
</pre>

<h3><a name="until Loop">until Loop</a></h3>

<p>The <tt>until</tt> loop tests for> loop termination at the <i>end</i>
of a loop, ensuring that at least one iteration of the loop will be
performed. </p>

<pre>
    loop
       [<i>statement list</i>] 
    until <i>expr</i>
    ...
    until <i>expr</i>
    endloop
</pre>

<p>There is no limit on the permissible number of <tt>until</tt>
statements in a loop. </p>

<pre>
    // evaluate first order modified Bessel function I0(x)
    
    local I0 = 1, term = 1, i = 1; 
    local xx = sqr (x/2), fac = xx;

    loop
        local fact = xx / sqr (i=inc i);
        term = term * fac;
        I0 = I0 + term;

        if i &gt;= 2 then fac = fact; endif
        local bd = term / (sgn [1,(1-fact)] * maxE [abs(1-fact),EPSILON]);
    until i &gt; MAX_ITERATIONS
    until abs bd &lt; EPSILON // error bound 
    endloop 
</pre>

<h2><a name="Jump Statements">Jump Statements</a></h2>

<p>A jump statement causes program execution to unconditionally transfer
to another point in the code. There are two jump statements:
<tt>break</tt> and <tt>continue</tt>.</p>

<h3><a name="break and continue">break and continue</a></h3>

<p>Normally, looping terminates when one of the loop termination
conditions is triggered.  However, it may be desirable to allow early
exits or to allow exits at arbitrary points in the iterated code, not just
at the top or bottom of a loop. <tt>break</tt> and <tt>continue</tt> are
used to do this.</p>

<p>In the following, the labels are used to mark the points jumped to by
the <tt>break</tt> and <tt>continue</tt> statements. </p>

<pre>
    ...

    loop
        ...

        continue;
        ...
        break;
    con:
       &lt;until ...&gt;
    endloop 
    brk: 
      ...
</pre>

<p>The <tt>continue</tt> statement causes a jump to <tt>con</tt> in the
above code sequence, and the <tt>break</tt> statement causes a jump to
<tt>brk</tt>. Thus, <tt>continue</tt> results in early termination of the
<i>current </i>iteration, <tt>while</tt> <tt>break</tt> results in early
termination of the entire loop. </p>

<p>The use of <tt>break</tt> and <tt>continue</tt> is restricted to bodies
of loops, and apply to only the <i>innermost</i> loop in which they
appear.</p>

<p>The modified Bessel function example from above can be re-written as
follows: </p>

<pre>
	// evaluate first order modified Bessel function I0(x)
    
    local I0 = 1, term = 1, i = 1;
    local xx = sqr (x/2), fac = xx;
   
    loop
        local fact = xx / sqr (i=inc i);
        term = term * fac;
        I0 = I0 + term;

        if i &gt;= 2 then 
	    fac = fact; 
	endif

        local bd = term / (sgn [1,(1-fact)] * maxE [abs(1-fact),EPSILON]);

        if abs bd &lt EPSILON then
	    break;
	elseif i &gt MAX_ITERATIONS then 
	    break;
       endif 
    endloop 
</pre>
