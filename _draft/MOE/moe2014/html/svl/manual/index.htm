<h2><a name="Purpose and Scope of this Document">Purpose and Scope of this Manual</a></h2>

<p>This document has been written both as a user's guide and as a
reference. Its purpose is to introduce the Scientific Vector Language
(SVL) to new users, to act as a tutorial for intermediate-level users, and
to serve as a reference for experienced SVL programmers.</p>

<p>This document is intended to give a comprehensive overview of the
basic<i> </i>SVL package. The basic SVL package may be run on its own, but
it is very likely that you will be executing SVL commands from within
application-specific software in which SVL has been embedded. In this
case, the application-specific software may have a library of
user-callable SVL routines. These routines are beyond the scope of this
manual, and for more information on them, please refer to their
accompanying documentation.</p>

<p>A good grasp of vector concepts and a good SVL programming style can be
achieved only through coding experience. Our aim has been to give users a
sufficient understanding of the principles of vector programming and of
SVL to be able to write their own code.</p>

<p>Although vector programming is a natural, efficient means for treating
data, most people are familiar only with the scalar programming approach.
We expect that many users embarking on this manual will have had little or
no prior experience with vector languages, so we will begin with a proper
introduction to vector concepts. It is our hope that users will come to
see the vector as a natural unit for data manipulation.</p>

<p>In examples, <tt>typewriter</tt> style is used to indicate SVL input
and output. The SVL prompt <tt>svl&gt;</tt> signals that what immediately
follows is what the user should type at the keyboard at the SVL command
line. Do not type the letters <tt>svl&gt;</tt> as part of the command. The
result, as returned by SVL in interactive mode, is displayed in
<tt>typewriter</tt> font without a prompt. When you are starting out, be
sure to type exactly what is given; in particular, be scrupulous about
reproducing brackets and uppercase letters.</p>
