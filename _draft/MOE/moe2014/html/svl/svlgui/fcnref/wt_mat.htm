<h2>Description</h2>


<p>
A pull-down material chooser used to manipulate material properties.
Material properties include
<ul>
    <li><i>Shading</i>. The degree to which an object appears
three-dimensional.  When there is no shading, the object appears flat.
    <li><i>Gloss</i>. The degree to which an object is shiny.
When there is no gloss, the object appears matte.
    <li><i>Brightness</i>. The amount of light reflected by an object.
When there is no brightness, the object appears dark.
    <li><i>Transparency</i>. The degree to which an object
    is transparent (optional).  When there is no transparency,
the object appears opaque.
</ul>
The currently selected material is used to render the sphere
displayed in the widget.

<p>
By default, the <tt>Material</tt> widget specifies properties for a single
material. It does, however, offer a Front and Back mode to handle
objects such as open surfaces which can accept different materials for their
front and back faces.
In this mode, the widget manages two distinct material values.
The current working face is selected using one of the
<tt>Both</tt> (in which case the front and back materials are the same),
<tt>Front</tt> or <tt>Back</tt> radio buttons exclusive
to this mode. 
When the front and back materials are different, the 
sphere used to display the materials is divided by a dashed line and rendered
using the front material for the left hemisphere and the back material for
the right.

<p>
Opening the <tt>Material</tt> widget reveals the material pull-down
consisting of five main areas:

<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Transparency Sliders</b>. If transparency is enabled, the top left
corner of the pull-down is occupied by transparency sliders. Moving
the sliders upwards increases the transparency. When the slider is at the
bottom, the material is opaque. The sliders are absent when transparency
is disabled.

<p>
<li><b>Material Palette</b>. Located at the top of the pull-down, the palette
organizes popular material values into a button bank for quick material
selection. The palette also contains two special materials: <tt>Saved</tt>
accesses the last saved material value, if any, and <tt>Reset</tt>
recalls the value of the widget when the pull-down was opened.

<p>
<li><b>Face Selection</b>. If Front and Back mode is enabled, the face selection
radio buttons are located under the Material Palette, on the left hand side
of the pull-down. When <tt>Both</tt> is selected, the transparency sliders
are locked together and property changes affect both faces. The face selection
buttons are absent when Front and Back mode is disabled.

<p>
<li><b>SGB Scales</b>. Located on the left hand side of the pull-down, three
<tt>Scale</tt> widgets are used to modify the Shading, Gloss and Brightness
parameters of the material. Alternatively, a value between 0 and 255 can be
entered in the text fields. Press &lt;<tt>Enter</tt>&gt; or <tt>Apply</tt>
to put the new values into effect.

<p>
<li><b>Preview</b>. Located at the bottom right of the pull-down, the preview
area displays a sphere rendered using the current material(s).
</ul>

Press <tt>Apply</tt> to set the <tt>Material</tt> widget to the current material
value. Pressing the <tt>Reset</tt> button recalls the value of the
widget when the pull-down was first opened. This is equivalent to selecting the
<tt>Reset</tt> material in the palette.
The <tt>Save</tt> button saves the current
material and makes it available under the <tt>Saved</tt> button to all
material widgets in your MOE session.

<h4>Attributes</h4>

<tt>Material</tt> inherits all <a class="svl" href="wt_core.htm">core</a>
attributes and defines the following attributes:</p>
<p>
 

<table class="titlebar" border="1" cellpadding="3">
  <tr>
    <th width="10%" valign="baseline">Attribute</td>
    <th width="50%" valign="baseline">Description</td>
    <th width="25%" valign="baseline">Values</td>
    <th width="10%" valign="baseline">Default</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="baseline"><tt>transparencyEnable</tt></td>
    <td valign="baseline">Enable modification of the transparency property
	and display of the transparency sliders.</td>
    <td valign="baseline"><tt>0/1</tt></td>
    <td valign="baseline">0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="baseline"><tt>frontbackEnable</tt></td>
    <td valign="baseline">Enable Front and Back mode and display of the
	face selection buttons.</td>
    <td valign="baseline"><tt>0/1</tt></td>
    <td valign="baseline">0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="baseline"><tt>autoApply</tt></td>
    <td valign="baseline">Enable auto-apply. When auto-apply is enabled,
	the value of the <tt>Material</tt> widget automatically updates with any
	changes to the material parameters.
    </td>
    <td valign="baseline"><tt>0/1</tt></td>
    <td valign="baseline">0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="baseline"><tt>materialColor</tt></td>
    <td valign="baseline">Color of the sphere used to preview the material.</td>
    <td valign="baseline"><tt>TRGB</tt></td>
    <td valign="baseline">0x001E8DE2 (light blue)</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h4>Trigger</h4>

<p>The <tt>Material</tt> widget triggers when a material selection is made,
i.e. when the <tt>Apply</tt> button is pressed. If <tt>autoApply</tt> is
enabled, the widget also triggers any time any material property is modified.

<h4>Data Value</h4>

<p>The material properties, in TSGB format.  The transparency occupies
the high byte (0 means opaque), followed by 1 byte each for the shading,
gloss, and brightness components:

<blockquote>
	<i>T</i>*256<sup>3</sup> + <i>S</i>*256<sup>2</sup> + <i>G</i>*256 +
<i>B</i>
</blockquote>

If <tt>frontbackEnable</tt> is on, the data value is a vector of
two material values.
The first is the value for the front face and the second for the back.
