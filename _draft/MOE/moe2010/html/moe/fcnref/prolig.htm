<h2>Ligand Interaction Diagrams</h2>
<hr noshade="noshade" />

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<pre>
    grkeys = <a class="fcnlink" href="#DrawLigandInteractions">DrawLigandInteractions</a> [ligands, receptors, opt]
</pre>

<p><a name="DrawLigandInteractions"></a></p><h2>Description</h2>

<pre>
grkeys = <span class="fcndef">DrawLigandInteractions</span> [ligands, receptors, opt]
</pre>

<p>The <tt>DrawLigandInteractions</tt> function prepares one or more <a
href="../../apps/prolig2d.htm">Ligand Interaction Diagrams</a>, based on the
given parameters. The flat graphic object keys returned are produced in the same
way as for the interactive application.

<p>The parameters <tt>ligands</tt> and <tt>receptors</tt> are nested vectors of
atom keys, which will be unit extended if appropriate. For example:

<pre>
    	// draw just one diagram

    grkey = DrawLigandInteractions [[ligand_atoms], [receptor_atoms]];

    	// draw three separate complexes
	
    grkeys = DrawLigandInteractions [[lig1, lig2, lig3], [rec1, rec2, rec3]];

    	// draw three ligands bound to the same receptor
	
    grkeys = DrawLigandInteractions [[lig1, lig2, lig3], [receptor]];
</pre>

The <tt>opt</tt> parameter is a tagged vector which may be used to override
the default settings. It may be omitted if the default operating values are
deemed acceptable.

<blockquote>
<dl>

<p><dt><tt>size</tt>

<p><dd>(Default: [500,500]) Specifies the size of the graphic objects, in
points, in the form of <tt>[width, height]</tt>. If the width and height are
positive, the diagram will be rendered in the center of the appropriately sized
bounding rectangle. If the size parameter is <tt>[0,0]</tt>, then the graphic
objects will be drawn to a fixed scale, and the resulting size will be
as large as necessary to accommodate the drawing objects.

<p><dt><tt>hbond_cut</tt>

<p><dd>(Default: 0.1) Specifies the minimum cutoff for a potential hydrogen bond
between a ligand and a receptor atom to be considered significant. The score is
expressed as a probability.

<p><dt><tt>metal_cut</tt>

<p><dd>(Default: 0.1) Specifies the minimum cutoff for a potential
metal-complexed ionic bond to be considered significant. The score is expressed
as a probability.

<p><dt><tt>solvent_cut</tt>

<p><dd>(Default: 0.1) Specifies the minimum cutoff for hydrogen bonds to solvent
(i.e. water). The same scoring method is used as for ligand-receptor hydrogen
bonds, except that solvent molecules need to be anchored to both the ligand and
the receptor in order to be included in the diagram.

<p><dt><tt>weak_dist</tt>

<p><dd>(Default: 4.5) Specifies the base distance, in &Aring;, to which receptor
residues must approach the ligand in order to be included in the diagram as
non-bonded residues.

<p><dt><tt>proxcontour</tt>

<p><dd>(Default: 1) If true, the proximity contour around the ligand will be
drawn.

<p><dt><tt>solvexposure</tt>

<p><dd>(Default: 1) If true, the ligand will be annotated with the degree of
exposure to solvent for each heavy atom.


<p><dt><tt>solvreceptor</tt>

<p><dd>(Default: 1) If true, the receptor residues will be annotated with the
loss of solvent exposure induced by the presence of the ligand.

<p><dt><tt>rescontacts</tt>

<p><dd>(Default: 0) If true, hydrogen bonds between receptor residues will be
calculated and scored in the same way as those between the ligand and receptor.

<p><dt><tt>arenecontacts</tt>

<p><dd>(Default: 0) If true, arene &pi;:&pi; and &pi:+ contacts will be
annotated in the diagram.

<p><dt><tt>receptunion</tt>

<p><dd>(Default: 0) If true, and multiple complexes are being drawn, then each
diagram produced will feature the union of the residues present in all of the
complexes, as determined by residue ID code.

<p><dt><tt>simultaneous</tt>

<p><dd>(Default: 0) If true, and multiple complexes are being drawn, then the
residue positions will be placed and refined concurrently for a composite of all
the specified complexes, such that the resulting diagrams will all use the same
receptor layout. This method can produce residue layouts that are significantly
different from those which would have been produced if each complex were
considered separately.

<p><dt><tt>showconserved</tt>

<p><dd>(Default: 0) If true, and multiple complexes are being drawn, special
annotations will be made for ligand:receptor hydrogen bonds which occur in at
least one complex, but not all. Also, if the receptors are not the same,
annotations will be made for any residues which are different or absent in some
of the complexes.

<p><dt><tt>res_radius</tt>

<p><dd>(Default: 0.75) Controls the residue disc radius in the final diagram.
The measurement is in &Aring; units, which is scaled in the same way as the
2D depiction of the ligand. Enlarging the residues can make the layout more
difficult.

<p><dt><tt>res_fontsize</tt>

<p><dd>(Default: 0.2) The size of the font used to annotate the residues may be
changed, which should typically be in proportion to the size of the residue
disc.

<p><dt><tt>rotation</tt>

<p><dd>(Default: 0) The diagrams produced may be rotated by an arbitrary
quantity, between -180&deg; and 180&deg;.

<tt>res_policy</tt>,
<tt>res_ucolor</tt><br />

<tt>met_policy</tt>,
<tt>met_ucolor</tt><br />

<tt>slv_policy</tt>,
<tt>slv_ucolor</tt><br />

<tt>wkc_policy</tt>,
<tt>wkc_ucolor</tt><br />

<p><dd>The coloring method for the various residue-type rendering objects may be
specified. <tt>res_*</tt> refers to receptor residues which are anchored to the
ligand by a hydrogen bond. <tt>met_*</tt> refers to metal ions which are
annotated as residues. <tt>slv_*</tt> refers to solvent residues which have
qualified for inclusion in the diagram. <tt>wkc_*</tt> refers to receptor
residues which do not have a strong interaction to the ligand, but have been
included in the diagram for proximity reasons.

<p>Each of the four residue types has a coloring policy, <tt>*_policy</tt>,
which must be one of the following tokens:

<ul>

<p><li><tt>'Auto'</tt>: (Default for all) The color will be determined based on
the chemical composition of the residue (polar, greasy, acidic, basic, solvent
or metal).

<li><tt>'User'</tt>: The color must be specified in the corresponding
<tt>*_ucolor</tt> parameter.

<li><tt>'Residue'</tt>: The color of the residue in the MOE system will be used
(see <tt>rColor</tt>).

<li><tt>'Chain'</tt>: The color of the chain in the MOE system will be used (see
<tt>cColor</tt>).

<li><tt>'None'</tt>: The residue will have no internal color, and be drawn as a
transparent circle.

</ul>

<tt>slv_score</tt><br />

<tt>ion_style</tt>,
<tt>ion_color</tt>,
<tt>ion_dist</tt>,
<tt>ion_score</tt><br />

<p><dd>The style, color and annotation for each of the hydrogen bond contacts
may be specified. <tt>sid_*</tt> refers to ligand-sidechain interactions,
<tt>bck_*</tt> refers to ligand-backbone interactions, <tt>slv_*</tt> refers to
ligand-solvent interactions, and <tt>ion_*</tt> refers to various types of ionic
contacts.

<p><tt>*_style</tt> controls the manner in which the interaction line is drawn,
and must be one of <tt>'solid'</tt>, <tt>'dotted'</tt> (default for all),
<tt>'dashed'</tt>, <tt>'dashdot'</tt> or <tt>'none'</tt>. <tt>*_color</tt>
controls the colors of the lines.

<p>If <tt>*_dist</tt> is true, then interactions of the corresponding type will
be annotated with the distance between heavy atoms, in &Aring;. If
<tt>*_score</tt> is true, then interactions will be annotated with their
probability score (in percent).

<p>In the following example, a collection of ligands docked to a single protein
will be used to prepare one diagram for each pose, with concurrent placement of
receptor residues and schematic annotation of non-conserved interactions:

<pre>
    ligatoms = cAtoms ligchains; // vector of form: [ligatoms1, ligatoms2, ...]
    recatoms = cAtoms recchain;  // vector of form: [recatoms]

    grkeys = DrawLigandInteractions [
    	ligatoms,
	recatoms,
	[receptunion: 1, simultaneous: 1, showconserved: 1]
    ];
</pre>
