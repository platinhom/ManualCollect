<h2>Tautomer and Protomer Enumeration</h2>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Given a molecular input, the protomer enumeration feature enumerates a list
of molecular species which are related to the input by a sequence of
transformations, which consist of some combination of  tautomeric shifts,
resonance interchanges, protonation and/or deprotonation reactions. The manner
in which the enumeration is performed is stepwise, and the applicable range of
transformations can be controlled to an extent by optional parameters.
</p>

<p><a name="ctab_EnumerateProtomers"></a></p><hr noshade="noshade" />
</p>

<pre>
[ctabs, graph] = <span class="fcndef">ctab_EnumerateProtomers</span> [ctab, opt]
</pre>

<p>The function <tt>ctab_EnumerateProtomers</tt> performs an exhaustive
enumeration of protomers, starting with the input structure, and terminating
when no new results can be found, or the maximum limit is achieved.
</p>

<p>The first parameter, <tt>ctab</tt>, must be a molecular species expressed in
the <a href="ctabfcn.htm">CTAB</a> format. Explicit hydrogen atoms are treated
as inviolate honorary heavy atoms during the enumeration process, therefore in
order for the enumeration to have any effect, the input representation must have
some or all explicit hydrogen atoms subsumed into the <tt>CTAB_A_HCOUNT</tt>
field. The implicit hydrogen fields must all be defined, i.e. non-negative,
otherwise the enumeration function will fail. It is also inappropriate to
provide aromatic bond types (<tt>CTAB_BT_ARO</tt>), which will not be properly
handled.
</p>

<p>One way to obtain such a suitable input is:
</p>

<pre>
    svl&gt; ctab = ctab_Extract [akeys, [heavy:1, aro:0]]
</pre>

<p>The <tt>opt</tt> parameter is a tagged vector which allows various options to
be controlled. Tautomer enumeration is always enabled.
</p>

<blockquote><dl>

<p><dt><tt>charge</tt> : <i>flag</i>
</dt></p>

<dd>If non-zero then some limited forms of resonance-style charge migration is
included in the enumeration steps, for example N(+)=C-N becomes interchangeable
with N-C=N(+). While resonance-equivalent forms are filtered from the final
output on the grounds of degeneracy, their presence during the enumeration
process can give rise to derived tautomers or protomers, due to the possibility
of different acidity and neighboring functional groups. The default is 0.
</dd>

<p><dt><tt>titrate</tt> : <i>flag</i>
</dt></p>

<dd>If non-zero then a number of transformations which involve adding or
subtracting a proton to bases and acids respectively are allowed, which leads to
the generation of protomers which have different overall charge and molecular
formula, but the same heavy atom skeleton. While the eligible acids and bases
are restricted to functional groups which have borderline pKa values, each of
the protonation/deprotonation transforms is considered fully reversible, which
leads to a combinatorial explosion of results when applied to molecules with a
large number of protonic functional groups (e.g. many carboxylic acid or
aliphatic amine functional groups). The default is 0.
</dd>

<p><dt><tt>unique</tt> : <i>flag</i>
</dt></p>

<dd>If on, then each proposed result of a transformation is converted to a
canonically unique molecular representation, compared with those of the
molecules already in the set, and discarded if already present. In this way,
topologically degenerate results such as C(=O)OH and C(OH)=O will not be
returned as two separate entries. If off, then the canonical reordering is not
performed, and so the two attachment points for hydrogen on a carboxylic acid
would be considered distinct results. The latter mode is particularly
appropriate when the input molecule already has well defined 3D geometry, e.g.
for ligands bound in an active site. The default is 1.
</dd>

<p><dt><tt>limit</tt> : <i>number</i>
</dt></p>

<dd>Because the enumeration process is stepwise, and the number of possible
results is nominally exponential with respect to certain functional groups, the
enumeration will be terminated when it reaches a predefined limit. The default
is 100.
</dd>

</dl></blockquote>

<p>The first entry in the returned vector, <tt>ctabs</tt>, is an array of one or
more molecular species, expressed in the CTAB format. The order of these results
is arbitrary, except that the input molecule is always present, and always
first. It is guaranteed that for each returned molecule, the atom number and
atom ordering is identical. The hydrogen count, charge and bond order fields
will be different for each result.
</p>

<p>The second return parameter, <tt>graph</tt>, describes the manner in which
the returned results are related by transformations, in neighbor-list format.
The presence of an edge between two nodes implies that there is a protomer
transformation between the two species.
</p>

<p><a name="ctab_ProtomerUnique"></a></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" />

<pre>
idxlists = <span class="fcndef">ctab_ProtomerUnique</span> [ctablist, opt]
</pre>

<p>Given a list of molecular structures, determines which of them are
tautomers or protomers of each other, and for each set of related
structures, returns their indices.
</p>

<p>The requirements for the input structures and options are the same as
for <tt>ctab_EnumerateProtomers</tt> as described above, and the
input may be composed of
tautomers only or both tautomers and protomers.
</p>

<p>Consider the molecules represented by the following SMILES strings:
</p>

<pre>
    CC(=O)CCC
    CC(O)=CCC
    CC(O)CC=C
</pre>

<p>The first two molecules are keto-enol tautomers of each other, while the
third molecule has the same molecular formula and heavy-atom skeleton, but it is
not a tautomer of either of the first two. The indices returned by the function
would be: <tt><span class="nobr">[[1, 2], 3]</span></tt>.
</p>

<p>The function does not determine which tautomer or protomer should be used as
the canonical reference, and the ordering within a group of indices has no
special meaning. For efficiency purposes, this function should not be called
with molecular species which have a different heavy-atom topology, since they
cannot be protomers. When all input structures are the same, no protomer
enumeration is necessary. Otherwise, protomer enumeration will have to be
conducted for at least one of the input structures. The worst case scenario is
that protomers will be enumerated for all input structures, which happens when
none of the structures are protomers of each other.
