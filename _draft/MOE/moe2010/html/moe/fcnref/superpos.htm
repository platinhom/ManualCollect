<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Let <i>X</i><sub>1</sub>,...,<i>X<sub>m</sub></i>, denote <i>m</i>
matrices each of dimension 3 by <i>n</i>. Let <i>x<sub>ki</sub></i> denote
the <i>i'</i>th column of the matrix <i>X<sub>k</sub></i>.
The matrix <i>X<sub>k</sub></i> is to be interpreted as a collection of
<i>n</i> points in 3D.  Let <i>w</i> be an <i>n</i>-vector of non-negative
weights such that the sum of the {<i>w<sub>i</sub></i>} is one.
Let <i>V</i> be a symmetric <i>m</i> by <i>m</i> matrix of positive
weights with zero diagonal such that the sum of the elements of <i>V</i> is
1/2.  Define the function <i>F</i> as follows:
<p>
<center><img src="superpos/supfcn.png"></center>
<p>
where <i>R<sub>k</sub></i> denotes a 3 by 3 rotation matrix and
<i>t<sub>k</sub></i> denotes a translation vector.  <i>F</i> is the smallest
sum of squared distances between corresponding points in the <i>m</i> point
sets over all solid body rotations and translations.  The value of <i>F</i> is
called the <i>weighted superposition distance</i> of the <i>m</i> point
collections. When <i>m</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;2 then the value of <i>F</i> is called
the <i>weighted mean square distance</i> between the two point sets.
When the {<i>w<sub>i</sub></i>} are all equal the value of <i>F</i> is called
the <i>mean square distance</i> between the point sets and its square root
is called the <i>root mean square distance</i> (RMSD) between the point sets.

<pre>[msd, R, t] = <span class="fcndef">Superpose</span> [X, w, V]</pre>

<p><tt>Superpose</tt> accepts three arguments <tt>[X,w,V]</tt> as follows:
<dl>
<dt><tt>X</tt>
<dd>
<tt>X</tt> is an <i>m</i>-vector
such that <tt>X(k)</tt> is the matrix <i>X<sub>k</sub></i> in the definition
of <i>F</i> above.  <tt>X(k)</tt> has the form <tt>[x,y,z]</tt> which are
the coordinates of the <i>k</i>'th point set.  Unit extension applies to all
elements of <tt>X</tt>.
<p><dt><tt>w</tt>
<dd>
<tt>w</tt> is an <i>n</i>-vector such that
<tt>w(i)</tt> is the value of <i>w<sub>i</sub></i> in the definition of
<i>F</i> above.  If <tt>w</tt> is null then all points are given equal weight.
Unit extension applies.  If the elements of <tt>w</tt> do not sum to one then
<tt>w</tt> is replaced with <tt>w&nbsp;/&nbsp;add&nbsp;w</tt>.
<p><dt><tt>V</tt>
<dd>
<tt>V</tt> is an <i>m</i> by <i>m</i> matrix such that <tt>V(k)(l)</tt> is
the value of <i>V<sub>kl</sub></i> in the definition of <i>F</i> above.  If
<tt>V</tt> is null then all off-diagonal entries of <tt>V</tt> are taken to
be one.
If the elements of <tt>V</tt> do not sum to 1/2 then <tt>V</tt> is replaced
with <tt>0.5&nbsp;*&nbsp;V&nbsp;/&nbsp;add&nbsp;V</tt>.
</dl>

<p><tt>Superpose</tt> computes the value of <i>F</i> defined above as well
as the collection of rotation matrices and translation vectors that give
rise to the value of <i>F</i>.  <tt>Superpose</tt> returns a vector
<tt>[msd,R,t]</tt> of length 3:

<dl>
<p><dt><tt>msd</tt>
<dd>
The value of <i>F</i> defined above.  If <tt>X</tt> is of length 2 then
<tt>msd</tt> is the mean square distance between the two point sets and
<tt>sqrt&nbsp;msd</tt> is the RMSD between the two point sets.
<p><dt><tt>R</tt>
<dd>
The set of rotation matrices that give rise to <tt>msd</tt>.  <tt>R(k)</tt>
is the rotation matrix used to transform <tt>X(k)</tt> to the position
that gives rise to the value of <i>F</i>.  The length of <tt>R</tt> is
equal to the length of <tt>X</tt>.  <tt>R(1)</tt> is always the identity
matrix.
<p><dt><tt>t</tt>
<dd>
The set of translation vectors that give rise to <tt>msd</tt>.  <tt>t(k)</tt>
is the translation vector used to transform <tt>X(k)</tt> to the position
that gives rise to the value of <i>F</i>. The length <tt>t</tt> is equal
to the length of <tt>X</tt>.
</dl>

<p>To transform the <i>k</i>'th point set to the position that gives rise to
the value of <i>F</i> the following code can be used.
<pre>    app add (R(k) * [X(k) - t(k)]);
</pre>
<p>Suppose that <tt>A</tt> and <tt>B</tt> are the positions of the atoms
of two conformations of a molecule.  To optimally superpose the second
conformation onto the first, the following code can be used.
<pre>    local [msd,R,t] = Superpose [[A,B]];
    B = app add (R(2) * [B - t(2)]) + t(1);
</pre>

<p><a name="Superpose_m_uniq"></a></p><p><hr noshade="noshade" />
<pre>mask = <span class="fcndef">Superpose_m_uniq</span> [X, msd_tol, w, class]
mask = Superpose_m_uniq [X, msd_tol, w, class, nbrlist]</pre>
<p>
<tt>Superpose_m_uniq</tt> computes the set of unique point sets where
two point sets are considered equal if the weighted mean square distance
between them is less than or equal to <tt>msd_tol</tt> calculated over all
permutations of the point sets that preserve the identities of the points
given by a vector of equivalence classes.
<tt>Superpose_m_uniq</tt> is similar in spirit to the <tt>m_uniq</tt>
function.  Its arguments are
<dl>
<p><dt><tt>X</tt>
<dd>
<tt>X</tt> is an <i>m</i>-vector
such that <tt>X(k)</tt> is the matrix <i>X<sub>k</sub></i> in the definition
of <i>F</i> above.  <tt>X(k)</tt> has the form <tt>[x,y,z]</tt> which are
the coordinates of the <i>k</i>'th point set.  Unit extension applies to all
elements of <tt>X</tt>.
<p><dt><tt>msd_tol</tt>
<dd>
Two point sets are considered equal if they superpose to a weighted mean
square distance less than or equal to <tt>msd_tol</tt>.
<p><dt><tt>w</tt>
<dd><tt>w</tt> is an <i>n</i>-vector such that
<tt>w(i)</tt> is the value of <i>w<sub>i</sub></i> in the definition of
<i>F</i> above.  If <tt>w</tt> is null then all points are given equal weight.
Unit extension applies.  If the elements of <tt>w</tt> do not sum to one then
<tt>w</tt> is replaced with <tt>w&nbsp;/&nbsp;add&nbsp;w</tt>.
<p><dt><tt>class</tt>
<dd>
<tt>class</tt> is an <i>n</i>-vector such that
<tt>class(i)</tt> is equivalence class identifier (usually an integer)
of the <i>i</i>'th point in the point sets.  If <tt>class</tt> is null then
all points are given unique equivalence classes.  Unit extension applies.
The value of <i>F</i> is calculated over all permutations of the point
sets such that the equivalence class vector remains the same.
<p><dt><tt>nbrlist</tt>
<dd>
<tt>nbrlist</tt> is an optional list of graph neighbors, in the same format
as used by the <tt>graph_xxx</tt> functions.  Unit extension does <i>not</i>
apply to this argument. The presence of the argument indicates that
the elements of each of the input point sets correspond to vertices
of a graph (the same graph for each set), and, when comparing the input
points sets, only those permutations should be considered that yield an
isomorphic graph.  If <tt>nbrlist</tt> is null or missing, then all
permutations (preserving the class equivalence) are considered.
For example, in the symmetric molecule 'C12(CC1)(CC2)', exchanging the third
and the fourth C is not a graph-isomorphic permutation and is considered
to be a duplicate only if the <tt>nbrlist</tt> argument is missing.
</dl>

<p>
<b>Warning!</b> The <tt>dmatch</tt> function is used to compute the permutations
of the point sets in the calculation.  Therefore, for best performance,
the point sets should not be too large nor should they contain many symmetries.
<p>
Suppose that <tt>pos</tt> is a vector of conformations of a molecule so that
<tt>pos(i)</tt> is the coordinates of the atoms of the <i>i</i>'th conformation.
Suppose that <tt>E</tt> is a vector of energies so that <tt>E(i)</tt> is
the energy of the <i>i</i>'th conformation.
Suppose that <tt>aclass</tt> contains the equivalence class identifiers
for each of the atoms (e.g. as obtained by <tt>aPrioZQH</tt>).  To
calculate the set of unique conformations up to an RMSD of 1.5 taking
symmetries into account, the following code can be used.
<pre>    [pos,E] = apt get [[pos,E],[x_sort E]];                   // sort by E
    local mask = Superpose_m_uniq [pos, sqr 1.5, 1, aclass];  // unique mask
    [pos,E] = [pos,E] || [mask];                              // filter duplicates
</pre>
