<h2>Molecule Washing</h2>
<hr noshade="noshade" />

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<pre>
    [ctablist, changed, filtlist] = <a class="fcnlink" href="#WashMoleculeMOE">WashMoleculeMOE</a> [akeys, opt]
    [ctablist, changed, filtlist] = <a class="fcnlink" href="#WashMoleculeCTAB">WashMoleculeCTAB</a> [ctab, opt]
</pre>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p><a name="WashMoleculeMOE"></a>
<p><a name="WashMoleculeCTAB"></a>

<pre>
[ctablist, changed, filtlist] = <span class="fcndef" href="#WashMoleculeMOE">WashMoleculeMOE</span> [akeys, opt]
[ctablist, changed, filtlist] = <span class="fcndef" href="#WashMoleculeCTAB">WashMoleculeCTAB</span> [ctab, opt]
</pre>

<p>Both functions provide a sequence of "wash" steps for a molecular connection
table. <tt>WashMoleculeMOE</tt> accepts an input molecule by way of atom keys,
which are internally converted to a CTAB representation, while
<tt>WashMoleculeCTAB</tt> takes a CTAB datastructure.

<p>The first return value, <tt>ctablist</tt>, is a list of molecular structures
in CTAB form. For most washing modes, this will consist of just a single
entry. The <tt>changed</tt> value is a flag which is set to 1 if any
significant modifications were made, or 0 if the input molecule was already
"clean". <tt>filtlist</tt> contains a list of CTAB structures representing
anything that was filtered out during the washing sequence.

<p>The actual steps carried out during the washing process is determined by the
contents of the <tt>opt</tt> argument, which takes the following form:

<blockquote><dl>

<p><dt><tt>dim</tt> : <i>number</i>

<dd>The dimensionality of the input coordinates. The default value, 0, means
that it is not known what significance the input coordinates have, and an
educated guess will be made when necessary. A value of 1 means that they are
definitely meaningless; a value of 2 means that the coordinates are from a 2D
depiction, and a value of 3 means that they are from a 3D model. For some
structure normalization, it is necessary to know the dimensionality of the
structure, e.g. wedge bonds are only meaningful for 2D sketches, while cis/trans
alkene stereochemistry is meaningful for both 2D and 3D structures.

<p><dt><tt>depict</tt> : <i>flag</i>

<dd>If set to 1,
then the coordinates of the input structure will be replaced by the
results of a 2D depiction layout.  The default is 0 (the coordinates
will not be modified).

<p><dt><tt>scale</tt> : <i>flag</i>

<dd>If set to 1,
then the X and Y coordinates of the input structure will be
examined to see if the average bond distance is approximately 1.5&Aring;.
If not, then
the coordinates will be scaled so that this is the case.
The default is 0 (no scaling).

<p><dt><tt>hydrogens</tt> : <i>token</i>

<dd>By default, explicit hydrogens will not be modified
(<i>token</i> is set to <tt>''</tt>).
If set to
<tt>'add'</tt>, then any missing explicit hydrogen atoms will be created, and
their positions will be assigned appropriately (either 2D or 3D geometry). If
set to <tt>'del'</tt>, then explicit hydrogen atoms will be deleted - except
those for which cannot be recreated unambiguously using a simple Lewis valence
formula.

<p><dt><tt>ylide</tt> : <i>flag</i>

<dd>If set to 1,
then ylide standardization rules are applied. Functional groups
which may be represented by either charge-separated or double-bond notation are
converted into a single form regardless of how they were input. The selected
form is that which is most commonly used for 2D sketches, e.g. <tt>P=O</tt> and
<tt>S=O</tt> bonds are represented as double bonds, whereas the nitro group is
represented as <tt>[N+](=O)[O-]</tt>.
The default is 0 (no standardization performed).

<p><dt><tt>chiral</tt> : <i>flag</i>

<dd>If set to 1,
derives chiral parity values for chiral atoms which do not already
have a chiral parity, as long as the chirality can be determined either from 3D
geometry or 2D geometry combined with wedge bonds.
The default is 0 (no chirality is derived).

<p><dt><tt>wedge</tt> : <i>flag</i>

<dd>If set to 1,
wedge bonds will be rederived from chiral parity values. This
should only be used if the input molecules are definitely 2D, or combined with
the <tt>depict</tt> option.
The default is 0 (no recalculation of wedge bonds is done).

<p><dt><tt>salts</tt> : <i>flag</i>

<dd>If set to 1,
disconnection of covalently bound simple salts is performed, e.g.
<tt>CC(=O)O[Na]</tt> is converted into <tt>CC(=O)[O-].[Na+]</tt>.
The default is 0 (no disconnection is done).

<p><dt><tt>component</tt> : <i>flag</i>

<dd>If set to 1,
then all connected components are removed except the one with the
largest number of heavy atoms (or the first, in the event of a tie). Excised
components are returned in the filter list. If used with the <tt>salts</tt>
flag, the salt disconnection is carried out first, i.e. the small ions will be
removed.  The default is 0 (no components are removed).

<p><dt><tt>depracids</tt> : <i>flag</i>

<dd>If set to 1,
then standard rules are used to deprotonate functional groups which
exist predominantly as their conjugate bases in aqueous solution, e.g.
carboxylic acids.  The default is 0 (no deprotonation takes place).

<p><dt><tt>protbases</tt> : <i>flag</i>

<dd>The counterpart to <tt>depracids</tt>, which protonates strong bases, such
as primary amines.   The default is 0 (no protonation takes place).

<p><dt><tt>neutralize</tt> : <i>flag</i>

<dd>If set to 1,
then any species which has localized charge (other than ylide
bonds) will be subjected to an attempt to prepare an entirely neutral
representation. If an entirely neutral structure can be achieved by reversing
standard aqueous protonation/deprotonation rules, the result can be obtained
quickly. Otherwise, it is necessary to perform a full protomer enumeration in
order to search for the result with the lowest charge magnitude. This situation
is often triggered by protonation states which are linked to double bond
migration.
The default is 0 (no neutralization is done).

<p><dt><tt>tautomers</tt> : <i>flag</i>

<dd>If set to 1,
then tautomer enumeration will be enabled. This is one of the
triggers which causes the result to contain multiple structures.
The default is 0 (no tautomer enumeration is performed).

<p><dt><tt>protomers</tt> : <i>flag</i>

<dd>If set to 1,
then protomer enumeration will be enabled. Tautomer enumeration is
implicitly enabled, and the result will likely contain multiple structures.
The default is 0 (no protomer enumeration is performed).

<p><dt><tt>exclacids</tt> : <i>flag</i>

<dd>Enumeration modes only. If set to 1,
then the resulting tautomers/protomers will
be filtered so that species which contain an acidic functional group which is
normally deprotonated in aqueous solution are excluded from the result list, and
added to the filter list instead.
The default is 0.

<p><dt><tt>exclbases</tt> : <i>flag</i>

<dd>The counterpart to <tt>exclacids</tt>, except that it filters out species
with basic functional groups which are normally protonated in aqueous solution.
The default is 0.

<p><dt><tt>enumsize</tt> : <i>number</i>

<dd>When an enumeration mode is being used, the default maximum size is 10
structures, which can be overridden with this option.

<p><dt><tt>enumdup</tt> : <i>flag</i>

<dd>If set to 1,
enumerated molecules will be filtered in order to
remove structures which are topologically equivalent. If set to 0 (default),
then topological duplicates will be retained.
This is most often appropriate when an
input molecule has specific 3D geometry, e.g. a ligand bound in an active site,
for which normal symmetry rules do not apply.

<p><dt><tt>AB_rules</tt> : <i>laminated vector</i>

<dd>This parameter can be specified as a laminated vector of the form
<nobr><tt>[type, smarts]</tt></nobr>, where each is an array of tokens. Each
entry of <tt>type(i)</tt> must be one of: <tt>'none'</tt>, <tt>'acid'</tt> or
<tt>'base'</tt>. The corresponding <tt>smarts(i)</tt> value must be a token
which is a valid SMARTS string. If the type is <tt>'acid'</tt>, then any atom
which matches the SMARTS string needs to be deprotonated; if the type is
<tt>'base'</tt> then matching atoms need to be protonated; if the type is
<tt>'none'</tt>, then no change is required. The action to be applied to each
atom is taken from the first SMARTS string that it matches, so matching a type
of <tt>'none'</tt> causes subsequent rules to be ignored.
