<h2>Databases Distributed with MOE</h2>
<hr noshade="noshade" />

<p>A number of useful databases are distributed with MOE.  Some are designed for
use with specific MOE applications while others are for more general use.</p>

<h2>Small Molecule Databases</h2>

<p><b>Leadlike Conformer Database.</b> The MOE Conformation Database
set, found on the DVD (<tt>leadlike_conf_###.mdb.gz</tt>), contains 3D
conformations in MOE Molecular Database format for approximately 650,000
(Oprea) lead-like chemical structures.  These are ready to be used for
pharmacophore searching, fingerprint analysis, and so on.
The structures were obtained from
the following chemical suppliers' public catalogs:

<p>
The conformations were generated with the MMFF94x forcefield using Conformation
Import in MOE.  A limit of 4.5 kcal/mol strain energy was imposed with
a 500 conformation limit for each molecule.  Duplicate conformations were
removed with a heavy atom RMSD tolerance of 0.6 angstroms (0.75 angstroms
for conformations with strain greater than 3.5 kcal/mol).
</p>

<p>
<b>Linker Database.</b> The MOE Linker Database contains conformations for
approximately 750,000 fragments suitable for <a href="../tutorials/scaff_tut.htm">
scaffold replacement</a> methodologies. The fragments
were generated using MOE's SD Pipeline Command Tools from 4.3 million
unique structures culled from medicinal chemistry literature and various vendor
catalogs. On average there are 24 conformations per molecule.  The database
is available on the DVD (<tt>linker_2010_10.mdb</tt>).
</p>
<p>
<b>RECAP Fragments.</b> <tt>recaplib.mdb</tt> is the output of
RECAP analysis on a collection of ~750,000 diverse lead- and drug-like chemical
structures from vendor catalogs and medicinal chemistry journals.  It can be
used with the <a href="../apps/recap.htm">RECAP Panel</a>.
</p>

<h2>Protein Databases</h2>

<p>
<b>Remediated PDB.</b>
A complete copy of the PDB database as of September 21, 2010 
can be found on the DVD (<tt>pdb_2010_09_21.mdb</tt>).  Each
record has been processed and converted into MOE format, and where possible
ligands corrected according to the CIF dictionary.  Key fields such
as COMPND, HET and KEYWDS have been extracted, to facilitate searching
the database. This database may be searched with the
<a href="../proteins/pdb_mdb.htm">Protein Database</a> Panel.
</p>
<p>

<b>Non-redundant PDB.</b> <tt>$MOE/lib/pdb.mdb</tt> is a database of non-redundant
chains derived from the PDB.  Chains were clustered such that all pairs
of chains within a cluster had 90% pairwise sequence identity as well
as similar structure.  One representative was chosen from each cluster
based on resolution, R free, and number of missing residues not at the
ends of chains.  Note that ligands and solvent are <b>not</b> included in
this database, only the protein chains are stored.  This database may be
searched with the <a href="../proteins/pdb_mdb.htm">Protein Database</a>
Panel and also serves as a set of possible templates for use
with <a href="../proteins/promodel.htm"> Homology Modeling</a>.

</p>
<p>
<b>Protein Families.</b> The non-redundant set of PDB chains is
further clustered structurally to form families.  These structure-based sequence
alignments are stored in the <tt>$MOE/lib/pdb.fam</tt> file in plain text.
Small families are enhanced with additional sequences from UniRef 50.
This file can be used during <a href="../proteins/prosearch.htm">
Homology Searching</a> to identify possible templates to a query.
</p>
<p>
<b>Antibody Families.</b> Similarly to the Protein Families, the antibody
sequences in the PDB have been grouped into families and can be used when
making homology models of antibodies.  <tt>$MOE/lib/fab.fam</tt> contains all
antibody chains clustered by organism and type.  <tt>$MOE/lib/fab_ref.fam</tt>
contains two <i>reference</i> alignments, one for heavy and one for
light chains, and is used to classify antibody chain types.
<tt>$MOE/lib/fab_germ.fam</tt> contains several VL-kappa, VL-lambda and T Cell
Receptor sequence families which can be used to identify other members of these
sequence families.
</p>
<p>
<b>Rotamer Library.</b> The <a href="../apps/rotamer.htm">Rotamer Library</a>
in MOE is a collection
of all-atom sidechain conformations derived from high quality x-ray crystal
structures. These conformations differ from traditional rotamer libraries in that
bond length and angle variations are permitted. The intent is to provide adequate
coverage of the conformational space available to a sidechain and not just encode
dihedral preferences. The rotamers are located in <tt>$MOE/lib/amino.mdb</tt> in a
packed conformation field associated with each sidechain.
</p>
<p>
<b>Protein-Ligand Complex Database.</b> <tt>$MOE/sample/mol/complex.mdb</tt>
contains a set of structures from the PDB with experimental binding affinities.
For each entry, <b>ligand</b> stores the ligand for which binding was measured,
and <b>receptor</b>, the nearby chains.  <b>image</b> contains
symmetry-related molecules which are near the ligand, if any, and <b>water</b>
contains any water chains.  <b>dG</b> contains the experimental binding
affinity of the ligand in kcal/mol, obtained from various sources in the
literature.  <b>degeneracy</b> indicates the number of copies of the ligand found
in the PDB file; each copy will have its own row in the database.  The other fields
contain summary information about the structure from the PDB file.  This
database can be used for validation studies.
