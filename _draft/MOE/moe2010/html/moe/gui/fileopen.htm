<a name="Introduction"></a>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The MOE open file system is used to perform a variety of
of &quot;open&quot; operations on files of different formats.
File formats are recognized automatically, but forcing a
particular format interpretation is possible in rare cases of need.
Where additional options are available, a secondary
panel will open.  For example, when molecular data from a PDB
file are being loaded into MOE, the
<a href="../../proteins/pdb_mdb.htm#OpeningPDBFiles">Load
PDB File</a> panel will be raised, or when an SKC file
(sketch file) is opened, the
<a href="mainwin.htm#SketchView">Sketch View</a> panel is raised.
</p>

<p>In MOE, the notion of <i>opening</i> a file has been extended beyond such
simple operations as opening a molecule file into the system or opening
a database file into a database viewer.  MOE's system for opening files
allows you to browse files, to operate on multiple files, and to select
from a variety of operations.  For example, you can choose either to load
a molecule into MOE or to add it to a database file.  The Open system
is not limited to files containing molecular data.  <i>Opening</i> an
SVL file for example, allows you to load or run the SVL module.
</p>

<p>The set of operations that can be performed on a particular file
is determined by the file's "type".  Each file is typed automatically.
You can, however, force a file to be treated as being of a certain type.
This becomes a necessity in the case of, for example, the ASCII database
type which cannot be automatically detected.
</p>

<p>To open a file, choose <span class="nobr"><b>File | Open</b></span> in
either the MOE Window or the Sequence Editor.
</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="fileopen/panel.png" alt="Open Panel" />
</p>

<a name="Using_the_Open_Panel"></a><a name="UsingtheOpenPanel"></a>
<h2>Using the Open Panel</h2>

<p>The Open panel contains a list of files from which you can select one
or more files to open, and a list of operations, common to all selected
files, from which you can choose the operation to perform.
</p>

<a name="SelectingFiles"></a>
<a name="Selecting_Files"></a>
<h3>Selecting Files</h3>

<p>To select a file, either select it in the file list or enter its
name in the text field and press <tt>Enter</tt>.  A path
specification may be included as part of the filename.
</p>

<p>
To make it easier to find the files you want to select, you can restrict
the list of displayed files to those satisfying a given pattern;
i.e. you can <a href="#Filtering">filter</a> the list.
</p>

<p> Note that only those files that are displayed in the file list
can be selected.  If, when filtering the file list, some of the selected
files become hidden (are omitted from the displayed list), those files
become unselected.
The number of currently selected files is reported in the header of
the file list.
</p>

<a name="CurrentWorkingDirectory"></a>
<a name="Current_Working_Directory"></a>
<h3>Current Working Directory</h3>

<p>MOE has a concept of the <i>current working directory</i>.  If no path is
given when specifying a file then the current working directory is the
directory used.  The value of the current working directory will affect where
files are saved to and read from.
</p>

<p>You can change the current working directory from the command line or
by using the CWD button in the Open panel.  From the Open panel follow
these steps to modify the current working directory:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Bring up the Open panel.</li>
	<li><a href="#ChangingDirectories">Change</a> to the desired directory.</li>
	<li>Press the <b>CWD</b> button.</li>
	<li>Close the panel.</li>
</ul>

<p>Alternatively, you can change the current working directory from
the command line by using the
<a class="svl" href="../../svl/fcnref/cd.html">cd</a> function.
</p>


<a name="ChangingDirectories"></a>
<a name="Changing_Directories"></a><h3>Changing Directories</h3>

<p>When the Open panel is first raised, the file listing of the current working
directory is displayed.  To open files from a different directory, you can
change the directory of the Open panel.  Note that this will have no effect on
the current MOE working directory.  The Open panel directory is shown in the
Path field.
</p>

<p>There are several ways to change directories in the Open panel:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Enter the name of the directory path in the text field and press
<tt>Enter</tt>
</li>
<li>Click on the arrow in the text field to open the shortcut list of
directory paths; choose a directory
</li>
<li>Press the <b>Up</b> button to go to the parent directory
</li>
<li>Double-click on the directory in the file list
</li>
<li>Select the directory in the file list then press <b>OK</b>
</li>
</ul>


<a name="SelectinganOperation"></a>
<a name="Selecting_an_Operation"></a><h3>Selecting an Operation</h3>

<div class="floatright">
<img src="fileopen/ops.png" alt="Operation Buttons" />
</div>


When you have one or more files selected, the available open operations
are presented as a set of buttons on the right-hand side of the panel.
Only the operations that are common to <i>all</i> selected files will
be available.  For example, both MOE molecule files and MDLMOL files can
be either opened into MOE or appended to a database, but neither file
type has any operations in common with SVL files.
<br clear="both" />
</p>


<div class="floatright">
<img src="fileopen/force.png" alt="Force Type Option" />
</div>


<p>If a file was not recognized to be of a given type, you can force its
type by using the <b>Force Type</b> option menu.  All recognized file types are
listed in this menu.  When Force Type is set to any type other than Auto,
the automatically detected file types are ignored.  All selected files are
treated as though they were of the specified type so that the operations on
that file type are available on all selected files, regardless of whether
they are actually applicable.
</p>

<p>There are several ways in which to select an open operation:
</p>

<ul>
<li>With one or more files selected, press one of the Operations buttons.</li>
<li>With one or more files selected, press <b>OK</b>.</li>
<li>Double-click on a file in the file list (opens exactly one file).</li>
</ul>

<p>The latter two cases use the notion of a "default action".  For file
types with only one possible open operation, that operation is the default
and will be performed on double-click or OK.  For file types with several
possible operations, there is usually one operation that is the default.
For example, for SVL files, <b>Run SVL File</b> is the default operation that
will be performed on double-click or OK.
</p>

<p>Once you have selected an operation, the Open panel closes.
</p>

<a name="FileInformation"></a>
<a name="File_Information"></a><h3>File Information</h3>

<p>You can browse the contents of the files in a directory by opening the
File Information panel (press <b>File Info</b>).  When a single file is
selected, information about the file is displayed in this panel, including
the first 1000 bytes of the file.
</p>

<p><center><img src="fileopen/info.png", alt="File Information Panel" />
</center>
</p>

<p>To be able to read/edit an entire file, press <b>Text Edit</b>.  This will
open each selected file into an SVL Text Editor.  The Open panel remains
up for further operations.
</p>

<a name="ChangingtheFileListDisplay"></a>
<a name="Changing_the_File_List_Display"></a>
<h2>Changing the File List Display</h2>

<p>The file list can display the type, date, size and name of each file
in the displayed directory.  The files that are shown are the ones
that match the current filter and settings.  The type, date and size
fields are optional and may be turned off in the Open Settings panel.
The filter is shown in the <b>Path</b> at the top of the panel and may be
altered through the name/filter text field.
</p>


<a name="Filtering"></a><h3>Filtering</h3>

<div class="floatright">
<img src="fileopen/path.png", alt="Open Panel Path" />
</div>

</p>

<p>
The files to be displayed may be restricted using a filter, which is
a pattern containing a wildcard.  The allowable wildcard characters are
as follows:
</p>

<dir>
  <table cellspacing="0" border="0" cellpadding="2">
    <tr>
      <td width="10%" valign="top"><tt>*</tt></td>
      <td width="90%" valign="top">matches 0 or more of any character </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top"><tt>?</tt></td>
      <td valign="top">matches any single character </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top"><tt>@</tt></td>
      <td valign="top">matches any single character in [a..z, A..Z, _ ] </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top"><tt>#</tt></td>
      <td valign="top">matches any single digit [0..9] </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top"><tt>[</tt>...<tt>]</tt></td>

      <td valign="top">matches any character in the set; ranges (using dash
      (<tt>-</tt>) symbol) are allowed </td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top"><tt>[^</tt>...<tt>]</tt></td>
      <td valign="top">matches any character <i>not</i> in the set
    </tr>
  </table>
</dir>

<p>
For more on wildcards, see
<a class="svl" href="../../svl/fcnref/findetc.html">findmatch</a>.
</p>

<p>There are several ways in which to apply a filter:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Type the filter in the text field and press <tt>Enter</tt>.</li>
<li>Click on the arrow in the text field and select one of the filters
from the shortcut list.</li>
<li>Press Clear to clear the current filter (reset it to <tt>*</tt>).</li>
</ul>

<div class="floatright">
<img src="fileopen/header.png" alt="Open Panel List Header" />
</div>


<p>
To show all files, set the filter to be the asterisk (<tt>*</tt>).
The current filter is displayed as a suffix to the directory in
the <b>Path</b> field.  The current number of files hidden because of the filter
is reported in the header of the file list.
</p>

<p>You can specify whether or not the filter is case-sensitive from the
Open Settings panel.  If the filter is not case-sensitive, then an
uppercase letter is not distinguished from its lowercase form.
</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> Directories are always displayed no matter what the filter
is set to.
</p>

<a name="DisplayOrder"></a>
<a name="Display_Order"></a><h3>Display Order</h3>

<p>You have several ways of controlling the order in which files are listed.
First, you can choose how the file list is to be sorted, for example, by name
or by type.  Second, you can choose how directories are to be listed.  Next,
you can decide whether to include in the list those files and directories
beginning with a dot (.).  Finally, you can specify a preferred
set of file types to be always given at the top of the file list.
</p>

<a name="Sorting"></a><h4>Sorting</h4>

<div class="floatright">
<img src="fileopen/sort.png" alt="Sort Files" /> 
</div>

Files can be sorted by name, type, size, or date.  In the
<span class="nobr"><b>Sort Files By</b></span>
controls, there are two sorting keys for the file list.  These apply to both
filenames and directory names.  The first key is the primary sort key, which
means it takes precedence over the second sort key.  For example, if you sort
first on type and then on name, the files will be clustered by type, with the
files of each type being sorted by name.  Note that dates displayed in the
panel are abbreviated, whereas the dates used for sorting are the full dates.
Check the file information (<b>File Info</b>) for the exact last modification
date of a file.
</p>

<p>In the Open Settings panel, the Case Precedence menu allows you to
determine how upper and lowercase letters are handled during name sorting.
The following options are available:
</p>

<dir>
  <table cellspacing="0" border="0" cellpadding="2">
    <tr>
      <td width="20%" valign="baseline">
	<tt><span class="nobr">a > A</span></tt></td>
      <td width="80%" valign="baseline">Uppercase letters come before
lowercase letters</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="baseline"><tt><span class="nobr">a = A</span></tt></td>
      <td valign="baseline">Case is ignored</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="baseline"><tt><span class="nobr">a < A</span></tt></td>
      <td valign="baseline">Lowercase letters come before uppercase letters</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</dir>

<p>The method of sorting may be specified in a local MOE resource file
using the following four resources:
</p>

<pre>
    fileopen.sort_key1=
    fileopen.sort_key2=
    fileopen.sortdown1=
    fileopen.sortdown2=
</pre>

<p><tt>sort_key1</tt> and <tt>sort_key2</tt> can be one of the following:
Name, Type, Size or Date. <tt>sortdown1</tt>, <tt>sortdown2</tt>
can be either 1 for reverse and 0 for not reverse.
</p>

<a name="Directories"></a><h4>Directories</h4>

<p>Directories can be listed together at the top or bottom of the file
list, or interspersed among the non-directory files.  The controls are
in the Open Settings panel.  Note that the directories <tt>'.'</tt> and
<tt>'..'</tt> are always listed at the top of the file list.
</p>

<a name="DotFiles"></a>
<a name="Dot_Files"></a><h4>Dot Files</h4>

<p>Files beginning with the character <tt>'.'</tt> are usually system
files and are less commonly opened from within a MOE session.  For this
reason, there are special options to omit files and directories with names
beginning with a dot ("dot files", "dot directories") from the file list
in the Open panel.
</p>

<p>Note that on Unix systems, the user menu file is called
<tt>.moe-menus</tt>.  In order to open (load) this file from the Open panel,
you must unhide dot files in the Open Settings panel.
</p>

<p>The number of hidden dot files and dot directories is not included in
the reported number of hidden files in the header of the file list.
</p>

<a name="PreferredFileTypes"></a>
<a name="Preferred_File_Types"></a><h4>Preferred File Types</h4>

<p>If there are files of a certain file type that are of particular interest
to you, you may wish to have them listed first above all other files in
the file list (but after directories).
</p>

<p>In the Open Settings panel, the Preferred Types text field allows
you to enter one or more patterns that will be applied to file types.
When Preferred Files is set to Top, the files of any types matching these
patterns will be listed first in the file list.  The patterns must be space
or comma separated.  The files of these preferred types will be listed in
the same order as the types in the Preferred Types text field.
</p>

<p>For example, the Preferred Types
</p>

<pre>
    moe, m*
</pre>

<p>will result in all files of type <tt>moe</tt> being listed first,
followed by all files whose types begin with the letter <tt>'m'</tt>,
and finally by the remaining files.
</p>

<a name="The_File_Open_Settings_Panel"></a><a name="TheFileOpenSettingsPanel"></a>
<h2>The File Open Settings Panel</h2>

<p>Which files to display and how to display them in the file list depends
not only on the current filter and directory specified in the Open panel
but also on the options given in the Open Settings panel.  Here you
may set your preferences such as whether or not you wish to see files
beginning with dot or whether you prefer directories to be displayed at
the top of the list or the bottom.
</p>


<p><center>
<img src="fileopen/settings_panel.png" alt="Open Settings Panel" />
</center>
</p>

<p>The settings in an Open Settings panel apply only to the Open
panel from which it was opened.  To put the settings into effect, press
<b>Apply</b>.  If you want the settings to apply to all subsequent Open
panels in this session of MOE, as well as to subsequent sessions of
MOE, press the <b>Save as Default</b> button.  Your settings will be
written to the user <a href="../../appendix/moeconfig.htm">MOE resource
configuration</a> (RC) file.
</p>

<p>If you have made some changes and wish to revert to the default settings,
press <b>Reset</b>.  The defaults in the RC file will be retrieved and
applied to the current Open panel.
</p>

<p>This section describes the options in the Open Settings panel.
The panel is opened from the Open Panel using the <b>Settings</b> button.
