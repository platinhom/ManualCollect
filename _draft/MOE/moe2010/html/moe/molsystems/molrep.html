<h2>Molecular Hierarchy: Atoms, Residues and Chains</h2>

<div class="floatright">
<img src="molrep/biotin_hierarchy.png"
alt="Molecular Hierarchy of the Streptavidin System" border="1" />
</div>

<p>In MOE, molecular data is organized in a hierarchy of
atoms, residues and chains, which together constitute the
<i>molecular system</i>.
At the bottom-most level are the
individual atoms.  These are visualized using the
<a href="../gui/mainwin.htm">MOE Window</a>, which provides
various rendering and atom editing tools.
</p>

<p>Atoms are grouped into units called <i>residues</i>,
which correspond to such standard chemical entities as amino acids,
DNA acids and bases, monosaccharides, polymer repeat units, etc.
A small molecule such as a ligand generally constitutes its own
residue, whereas a macromolecule such as a protein is composed
of a sequence of residues.
</p>

<p>Residues in turn are sequenced into <i>chains</i>.  A single
chain often comprises an entire molecule, but can also represent
a logical macromolecular unit such as half of a dimer or the
H and L arms of an antibody.
The <a href="../gui/se.html">Sequence Editor</a>
(<span class="menu">MOE | Window | Sequence Editor</span> or
<span class="menu">MOE | SEQ</span>) displays molecules
in terms of chain and residue objects.
</p>

<p>In general, small single-residue
molecules such as ligands
are most often managed solely from the MOE Window.
In contrast,
proteins, comprising a residue sequence with or without
accompanying structural (3D coordinate) data, are
typically manipulated using both the Sequence Editor, e.g. for
studying sequence alignment, and the MOE Window, for visualization
and examining protein-ligand interactions.
</p>

<p>
A third window,
the <a href="../gui/atommgr.html">Atom Manager</a>
(<span class="menu">MOE | Window | Atom Manager</span>),
displays information about all objects in the system.
<br clear="both" />
</p>

<a name="Molecular_Properties"></a><h3>Molecular Properties</h3>

<div class="floatright">
<img src="molrep/biotin_render.png"
alt="Rendering of a Molecular System in MOE" />
</div>

<p>Each level of the molecular system has an associated
set of properties or <i>attributes</i>.
For example, an atom has atomic data such as element
and charge as well as rendering options such as color and visibility
associated with it.
Similarly, a residue has associated residue data such as name and
sequence position as well as rendering options such as residue color
and ribbon drawing mode.  Chain attributes include color and number.
</p>

<p>Each residue and chain has an assigned ordinal
number. Chain numbers are unique within the system;
residue numbers are unique within a given chain. A residue is numbered
according to its position in the sequence of residues making up its parent
chain. Chain numbers can be modified by re-ordering the chains.
Residue and chain numbers are shown in the Sequence Editor.
</p>

<p>
<center>
<img src="../gui/se/se_chainnumbers.png" />
</center>
</p>

<p>
Chains also have several identifiers associated with them (tag and name
are easily modified in
the <a href="../../apps/ligx.htm#System">System</a> popup).
</p>

</p>
<center>
<table class="titlebar">
<tr>
<th>Identifier</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><tt>header</tt></td>
<td>Typically, the HEADER line from a PDB file.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><tt>name</tt></td>
<td>For proteins, this may contain the 4-letter PDB code and
chain letter (if any), separated by a period.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><tt>tag</tt></td>
<td>Used to identify a group of chains.</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>The overall &quot;compound name&quot; assigned to a given
chain is a concatenation of the chain header, name, and tag.
When saved in MOE <a href="#MDB_Format">MDB format</a>,
a molecule, which can be a single chain or composed of
multiple chains, can be assigned a separate molecule name.
</p>

<p><b>Chain Tag.</b>
The chain tag is of particular interest in MOE because it
is used to group chains into systems or <i>tag groups</i>,
which are collectively displayed in the MOE Right Button Bar
<a href="../../apps/ligx.htm#System">System</a> popup, shown here:

<p>
<center>
<img src="../../apps/ligx/sys_popup.jpg" />
</center>
</p>

<p>The System popup is a list of control lines, one per
tag group and tag group component (receptor, solvent, ligand).
Tag groups can be manipulated
as a block using the buttons in the control lines.
Operations include selection, activation, hiding and
showing, and setting rendering style.
There is bubble help in the popup which summarizes the functionality
of each button.
</p>

<p>In the Sequence Editor,
chains can be managed by chain tag using the following commands:
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Display chain tags: <span class="menu">SE | Display | Chain Tag</span>
</li><li>Color by chain tag: <span class="menu">SE | Display |
    Color Chains | By Tag</span>
</li><li>Sort chains by tag: <span class="menu">SE | Edit | Sort Chains |
    By Tag</span>
</li><li>Select chains with same tag: <span class="menu">SE | Chain Popup |
    Select | Chains with Same Tag</span>
</li><li>Set tags of selected chains:
    <span class="menu">SE | Edit | Set Chain Tags</span>
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>

</p>

<a name="Visualizing_the_Molecular_System"></a>
<h2>Visualizing the Molecular System</h2>

<h3>MOE Window</h3>

<p>
Molecular data and its attributes can be visualized in different ways in MOE.
To visualize a molecular system in 3D, it must first be loaded into MOE.
This can be done using the <a href="../gui/fileopen.htm">Open</a>
panel which is opened with
</p>

<blockquote>
<span class="menu">MOE | File | Open</span>
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>Files in different formats can be read in, including
the MOE native format,
<a href="../../proteins/pdb_mdb.htm#OpeningPDBFiles">PDB</a>,
MOL2, and Maestro, among others.
</p>

<div class="floatright">
<img src="molrep/siteview.png" />
</div>

<p>Once a molecular system is loaded, it is automatically rendered
in the MOE Window.
The molecule rendering can be modified using the
<a href="../gui/mainwin.htm#RenderingAtoms">Atoms</a> and
<a href="../gui/mainwin.htm#RenderingBackbone">Ribbon</a>
popup panels that can be raised, for example, from the
MOE <a href="../gui/mainwin.htm#Footer">Footer</a>.
</p>
<p>
<b>Atoms.</b> Atom attributes can be annotated in the MOE Window using labels or
special coloring modes.
For example, using the Atoms popup,
atoms can be labeled by charge or by residue, or colored
by temperature factor.
Backbone ribbons can be rendered in various styles,
and backbone atoms can be colored to highlight such
properties as secondary structure or N and C terminii.
</p>

<p><b>Hydrogen Bonds.</b>
Non-bonded interactions can be visualized in the MOE Window
in different styles.  Both hydrogen bond and van der Waals
steric interactions can be drawn, specified using the
<span class="menu">MOE | Footer |
<a href="../gui/mainwin.htm#Contacts">Contacts</a></span>
popup, which provides a receptor/solvent/ligand interaction matrix 
controlling which contacts are drawn as well as at what strength.
</p>

<p><b>Surfaces</b>. Molecular surfaces colored by various properties
help visualize the spatial extent and regions of importance
of molecular structures.  The <span class="menu">MOE | RHS | Surface</span>
commands provide for quick drawing of receptor, ligand, as well as
van der Waals protein-ligand interaction surfaces.  The
<a href="../../apps/surfmap.htm">Surfaces and Maps</a> panel
offers a wider variety of surface types and coloring modes.
</p>

<p><b>Isolate.</b>
Various commands exist to help focus on areas of particular
interest and to de-clutter the display.
Hydrogen atom visibility is easily controlled using the
<b>Hydrogens</b> button in the MOE Right Button Bar.
Successive pushes cycle through display of
(a) no hydrogens, (b) polar hydrogens only, c) all hydrogens.
Solvent, dummy, and sidechain atoms of proteins can be hidden and shown
using the <span class="menu">MOE | RHS | Hide</span> and <b>Show</b> menus.
Whole systems or components thereof can be hidden and shown
using the <a href="../gui/mainwin.htm">System</a> popup.
Finally, 
special visualization tools, such as the
<a href="../../apps/ligx.htm#SiteView"><b>SiteView</b></a> button
in the MOE Right Button Bar, or <b>Isolate</b> buttons
in various applications (e.g.
<a href="../../apps/prolig2d.htm">Ligand Interactions</a>
or <a href="../../apps/shaman.htm">MedChem Transformations</a>),
exist to restrict the display.
</p>

<p>Note: Small molecules can also be visualized in 2D using
the <a href="../../apps/view2d.htm">2D Molecules</a> viewing
tool (<span class="menu">MOE | Compute | 2D Molecules</span>).
</p>

<h3>Sequence Editor</h3>

<div class="floatright">
<img src="../gui/se/se.png" />
</div>

<p>In the Sequence Editor, macromolecules can be studied on a
residue and chain level. Structural features can be displayed as
<a href="../gui/se.html#ModifyingTheDisplay">secondary
structure bars and hydrogen bond arcs</a> using
commands in the <span class="menu">SE | Display</span> menu.
Residues can be
<a href="../gui/se.html#EditingMolecularObjects">manually aligned</a>
using the mouse,
and chains can be
<a href="../gui/se.html#JoiningAndSplitting">joined or split</a>,
and <a href="../gui/se.html#MovingChains">reordered</a>.
</p>

<p>The connection between atoms in the MOE Window and residues in the
Sequence Editor can be achieved by synchronizing atom selection with
residue selection by turning on
<span class="menu">MOE | Selection | Synchronize</span>
(or, equivalently, <span class="menu">SE | Selection | Synchronize</span>).
When this option is on, selecting
an atom in the MOE Window causes the parent residue to be
simultaneously selected in the Sequence Editor.  Similarly, when
a residue is selected in the Sequence Editor, the child atoms will
be selected in the MOE Window.
</p>

<h3>Changing the View</h3>

<p>
The view can be manipulated using both the mouse and the
<a href="../gui/mainwin.htm#Footer">trackball</a> in the MOE footer.
The mouse commands are summarized as follows:
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Rotate.</b> Drag the middle mouse button.
</li><li><b>Translate.</b> <tt>Shift</tt>-Drag the middle mouse button.
</li><li><b>Zoom.</b> <tt>Ctrl</tt>-Drag the middle mouse button (or
scroll the scroll button if it exists).
<li><b>Change the Center of Rotation.</b> Middle click on an atom.
To revert to the default (at the center of mass of the system),
middle click on the background of the MOE Window (away from any atoms).
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Note that the actual mouse buttons used may be system-dependent.
Please refer to the chapter on
<a href="../gui/mouse.html">Using the Mouse</a> for more details.
</p>

<p>
One of the most common view
adjustments is centering the molecular system in the MOE Window.
This can be done using <span class="menu">MOE | RHS | Center</span>.
For more details about changing the view, please refer to
<a href="../gui/mainwin.htm#Viewing">Rotating, Translating, and
Zooming the View</a>.
Note that changing the view does not change the atom coordinates.
</p>

<a name="Chemical_Representation"></a>
<h2>Chemical Representation in MOE</h2>

<a name="Valence_Model"></a>
<h4>Valence Model</h4>

<div class="floatright">
<img src="molrep/so2.png" />
</div>

<p>MOE assumes atoms with full octet.  Hydrogen adjustment
(e.g. <span class="menu">Add H</span> in the
<a href="build.html">Builder</a>, or
<span class="nobr"><a href="../../apps/protonate3d.htm">Protonate 3D</a></span>)
will add or remove hydrogens to complete valence.
</p>

<p>
A charge-separated representation is used for 
coordinate-covalent bonds; for example, SO<sub>2</sub>
is drawn using S++, O- and O- rather than O=S=O.
</p>

<p>Lone pairs are usually not rendered, however their display may
be enabled using
<span class="menu">MOE | Edit | Hydrogens | Add Hydrogens and LPs</span>
and disabled using
<span class="menu">MOE | Edit | Hydrogens | Delete Lone Pairs</span>
</p>

<a name="Stereochemistry"></a>
<h4>Stereochemistry</h4>

<p>Stereochemistry in MOE is enforced using
constraints, which can be set with commands in
the <span class="menu">MOE | Edit |
<a href="../gui/mainwin.htm#Chirality">Chirality</a></span>
menu or in the
<a href="build.html#Stereochemistry">Builder</a>.
The constraints are topological, meaning they are invariant
with respect to geometry as determined by atom 3D coordinates.
If no constraint is in effect, the compound is considered
racemic, and flipping between stereochemical states is unrestricted
during forcefield simulations such as energy minimization.
The Builder, in addition to setting constraints, also
provides feedback (via button label colors)
on whether a constraint exists,
and if so, whether there is agreement between the
current geometry and the constraint.
</p>

<p>To see which atoms are chiral or chirally constrained, the
following selection commands can be used:
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Chirally constrained atoms:
<span class="menu">MOE | Selection | Potential |
Forced Chirality</span>
</li><li>
E/Z constrained atoms:
<span class="menu">MOE | Selection | Potential |
Forced StereoBond</span>
</li><li>
Atom coordinate geometry:
<span class="menu">MOE | Selection | Geometry</span>.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>The
<a href="../gui/select.htm#AtomSelectionButtons">Atom Selector</a></span>
can also be used to select chiral centers.
</p>

<p>Note: When depicting in 2D
<span class="nobr">(<b>MOE | Compute | 2D Molecules</b>)</span>,
wedge bonds will be displayed only for atoms with chiral
constraints set.
</p>

<a name="Aromaticity"></a>
<h4>Aromaticity</h4>

<p>Aromatic compounds in MOE are, generally speaking, identified using 
H&uuml;ckel's <span class="nobr">(4<i>n</i> + 2)</span> rule.
In the MOE Window, aromatic rings are drawn in
Kekul&eacute; style, with alternating
single-double bonds.  Aromatic atoms can be identified in MOE
using the
<span class="menu">MOE | Selection |
<a href="../gui/select.htm#AtomSelector">Atom Selector</a></span>.
Press <b>Aro</b> in the <b>Element</b> button bank.
</p>

<a name="Periodic_Systems"></a>
<h4>Periodic Systems</h4>

<p>Periodicity is enabled in MOE using the
<a href="../../apps/crystal.html">Crystal Parameters</a>
panel, which can be opened from the MOE footer (the
button is labeled PBC &ndash; <i>P</i>eriodic
<i>B</i>oundary <i>C</i>onditions &ndash; by default, and will change
to the space group when the periodic system is enabled)
or from the <span class="menu">MOE | Window</span> menu.
The space group and cell parameters can be set in this
panel as well as the molecule display mode.  The panel
can also be used to build a lattice of crystal cells.
</p>


<a name="SVL"></a><h2>Programming in SVL</h2>

<p>When using SVL to manipulate molecular objects,
<a href="../fcnref/molrw.html">data input and output</a>
function calls are needed
to read data from molecular data files or databases
and to save results.  After data is loaded into the
system, it can be operated upon using the molecule
object functions described below.  In addition,
many MOE built-in applications can be invoked
programmatically.  Once an SVL program is
complete, it can be run in either graphical
MOE or <a href="../../install/install.htm#RunBatch">MOE/batch</a>.
</p>

<p>
<ul class="help">
<li class="help">
For more information on writing SVL programs,
please see the
<a href="../../tutorials/mpgtut.html">MOE Programming Tutorial</a>.
</ul>
</li>
</p>

<a name="Molecular_Objects_and_Keys"></a>
<h3>Molecular Objects and Keys</h3>

<div class="floatright">
<img src="molrep/hierarchy.gif" alt="Molecular Hierarchy" />
</div>

<p>A molecular system can be examined and manipulated using
graphical interfaces such as the MOE Window or the
Atom Manager.  Alternatively, inquiries and modifications
to the system can be made at the
<a href="../gui/svlcommands.html">SVL Command Line</a>
using SVL molecular object commands (function calls).
</p>

<p>Molecular objects (chains, residues, atoms)
each have their own unique identifying
<i>key</i> which lasts the duration of the object's lifetime
(i.e. while it remains loaded in MOE).
The actual value of the key has no significance
and is not preserved between MOE sessions or even between
different loadings of the same molecular data.
</p>

<p>Molecular object keys are used in SVL function calls to access the
corresponding molecular objects.  The SVL molecular object commands
have an object-oriented flavor &ndash; there are
atom, residue, chain, and general molecular object functions.
The function naming scheme is explained in the following table:
</p>

<blockquote>
<table class="titlebar">
<tr>
<th>Type</th>
<th>Prefix</th>
<th>Example</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Atom</td>
<td><tt>a</tt></td>
<td><tt>aElement</tt>, <tt>aHCount</tt></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Residue</td>
<td><tt>r</tt></td>
<td><tt>rPos</tt>, <tt>rAtoms</tt></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Chain</td>
<td><tt>c</tt></td>
<td><tt>cNumber</tt>, <tt>cColor</tt></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Object</td>
<td><tt>o</tt></td>
<td><tt>oParent</tt>, <tt>oType</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>SVL function calls exist both to make inquiries about
molecular objects as well as to modify their attributes.
The names of the SVL functions used to modify molecular
attributes all contain the word <tt>Set</tt>, for example
</p>

<pre>
    aSetTempFactor
    rSetPos
    cSetHeader
</pre>

<p>The molecular object hierarchy is represented using
parent-child relationships:
chains are parents of residues, and residues are parents of atoms.
Note that this organization is strict &ndash;
chains are never parents of atoms, for example.
Similarly, atoms are the children of
residues, and residues are the children of chains.  Chains and residues
can be empty. Because chains,
residues and atoms are distinct entities, selecting or manipulating an object
(e.g. a chain) is not equivalent to selecting or manipulating
its children (e.g. the residues of that chain).
The converse is also true: manipulating the children of an
object is not equivalent to manipulating their parent.
</p>

<p>Within the system, chains are
ordered according to their chain number
(as shown in the Sequence Editor and given by
<a class="svl" href="../fcnref/chain.htm">cNumber</a>).
Within each chain, residues are ordered according to their
residue number (as shown in the Sequence Editor and
given by <a class="svl" href="../fcnref/residue.htm">rNumber</a>).
Within each residue, atoms are ordered according to
atom index.  The ordering of atoms is generally arbitrary,
often related to atom creation order.
</p>

<p>
<ul class="help">
<li class="help">

the SVL molecular object functions, please refer to

</li>
</ul>
</p>

<a name="Private_Systems"></a><h3>Private Systems</h3>

<p>MOE maintains a global system which is always displayed
in the MOE Window.
When performing operations on molecular data, it is
sometimes desirable to leave untouched this global system
and to operate in a separate work area.  In MOE, this is possible
using private systems.  A private system behaves exactly
like the main MOE system, but is entirely divorced from
it: any changes to a private system do not
affect the main one.  Private systems cannot be displayed
in the MOE Window, and more than one private system
can exist at any given time.
</p>

<p>A private system is created as follows:
</p>

<pre>
    local pdata = <a class="svl" href="../fcnref/obj.htm">SystemPush</a> [];

	// ... application code ...

    <a class="svl" href="../fcnref/obj.htm">SystemPop</a> pdata;
</pre>

<p>Each new system must be closed (in this case,
with <tt>SystemPop</tt>).
</p>

<a name="MDB_CTAB_Formats"></a>
<h3>Molecular Database and CTAB Formats</h3>

<p>Molecular data can be stored as a molecule file or
in a molecular database.  In MOE, both the
native
<a class="svl" href="../fcnref/moefmt.htm">.moe</a> file format
as well as the
<a href="../fcnref/extract.htm">molecular database (MDB) format</a>
encode both molecular data and hierarchical information.
</p>

<p>Perhaps the simplest and most direct way to work
with molecular systems is to load them into MOE, either
from a file or from a database:
</p>

<blockquote>
<span class="menu">MOE | File | Open</span><br />
<span class="menu">DBV | Molecule Cell | Popup | Send to MOE</span>
</blockquote>

<p>
and manipulate them
either graphically using MOE windows and panels or
programmatically using SVL molecular object calls.
It is sometimes desirable, however,
to work with molecules without having
to first load them into MOE.  For example, it is faster to
read a molecule from a MOE database and operate
directly (using SVL) on the raw molecular data.
</p>

<p>Other representations of molecular data in MOE include
<a href="smiles.html">SMILES</a> strings and
the <a href="../fcnref/ctabfcn.htm">Connection Table (CTAB)</a>
format.  This latter format is intended for small molecules
and is useful for its ability to explicitly encode, for example,
attachment points.  It does not, however, encode chain or
residue information.
</p>

<p>Molecular data can easily be converted between formats.
The following table lists the SVL function calls used
to convert between the MDB, CTAB, and SMILES representations,
and to load them into and extract them from MOE.
</p>
