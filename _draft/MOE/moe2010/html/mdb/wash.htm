<!-- =========================== BACKGROUND =============================== -->

<h2><a name="Methods">Methods</a></h2>

<p>Prior to conducting an operation on a database of molecules, it is often
desirable to apply to each molecule a set of cleaning rules such as removing
extraneous salts or adjusting protonation states, in order to ensure that 
each structure is in a form suitable for subsequent modeling steps such
as conformation enumeration and protein-ligand docking. The
Database Wash application is suitable for applying a preparation policy to all
entries in a MOE molecular database.

<p>The Database Wash application proceeds by applying the following operations
to each input structure, with each step being optional:

<ol>

<li><p>Replace or recalculate the molecule name

<li><p>Disconnect simple metal salts drawn in covalent notation

<li><p>Remove minor components (e.g. counterions and solvent molecules),
optionally storing the removed components in an alternate field

<li><p>Rebalance protonation states by deprotonating strong acids and/or
protonating strong bases

<li><p>Add explicit hydrogen atoms, or remove safely-deletable explicit hydrogen
atoms

<li><p>Replace the atomic coordinates with an aesthetic 2D depiction layout

<li><p>Enumerate tautomers and possibly also protonation states

<li><p>Filter enumerated structures according to strong acid/base rules

</ol>

<p>The following sections describe the various wash operations which are
pertinent to MOE molecular databases. The results of the wash operation can be
written back to the original database, or they can be emitted to a new database.
When using the tautomer/protomer enumeration mode, the output must be written to
a new database, since a one-to-many relationship is established between the
input and output.

<p>A similar set of operations is available for application directly to MDL SD
files, which is described in the documentation for the 
<a href="../moe/fcnref/sdwash.htm"><tt>sdwash</tt></a>
command line tool.

<h3><a name="MolName">Molecule Naming</a></h3>

<p>In a MOE molecular database, each entry has an optional molecule name, which
is shown in the database viewer when the viewing size of the field is shrunk to
a single line. The molecule name can originate from a variety of sources,
such as
importation from another database format which supports molecule names (e.g. MDL
SD files), or canonical name calculation
(e.g.  <span class="nobr">
<b>DBV | Compute | Molecule | <a href="dbedit.htm#MoleculeNames">Molecule Names</a></b>
</span>).
Regardless of whether the molecule name is a computed
property or a registration key, it is potentially useful for tracking the
progress of a chemical entity after it is subjected to various calculations.

<p>When washing a database, the molecule name can be left unaltered, or it can
be replaced with a canonical SMILES string, or its value can be set to the value
of a field which is also present in the database.

<h3><a name="Depict">2D Depiction</a></h3>

<p>If the database is being prepared for a purpose which involves viewing of the
molecules, it is often desirable to have the molecular geometry of the molecules
replaced by a 2D layout which conforms to aesthetic diagram conventions. Using
the MOE 2D depiction algorithm [Clark&nbsp;2006], a suitable layout can be
produced for
each molecule, such that the molecules in the database can be easily viewed in
place, or exported to external applications.

<h3><a name="Hydrogen">Addition or Removal of Hydrogen Atoms</a></h3>

<p>Many sources of molecular data are stored in hydrogen-suppressed mode, and it
is therefore assumed that the number of hydrogen atoms attached to each atom in
the structure can be computed by a formula which takes into account atomic
element, charge, bond orders, and various other possible annotations such as
radical state. While for most organic molecules this calculation is simple and
unambiguous, the implicit hydrogen count can be unreliable for atoms which are
hypervalent, are not in the organic block of the periodic table, or have unusual
properties such as radicals or carbenes, which are not always appropriately
annotated.

<p>When washing a molecular database with addition of hydrogen atoms, the
algorithm that is used for determining the number of hydrogen atoms to add to
each heavy atom is the same as is used throughout MOE, and is equivalent to:

<pre>    implicitH = aHCount akeys - aExplicitHCount akeys</pre>

<p>For each heavy atom which has an implicit atom count of greater than zero,
the corresponding number of hydrogen atoms will be created. New hydrogen atoms
are added to the end of the molecule entry, and bonded to their parent atom. For
calculated negative numbers of implicit hydrogen atoms, no action is taken.

<p>The method used for removing hydrogen atoms from input structures is by
contrast very conservative, since most file formats do not have a field for
storing the number of implicit hydrogen atoms. When converting a molecule into a
hydrogen-suppressed representation, explicit hydrogen atoms are only deleted if
there is no ambiguity as to whether they can be safely recreated.

<p>Explicit hydrogen atoms are considered safe to delete if they meet all the
following criteria:

<ul>

<li>Terminal

<li>Neutral

<li>Sigma-bonded

<li>Not annotated as an attachment point (A0, A1, ..., A9)

<li>The parent atom is one of: B, C, N, P, As, O, S, Se, Te, F, Cl, Br, I

<li>For the parent atom: valence + bond orders - charge = 8

</ul>

<p>All other hydrogen atoms are considered unsafe to delete, and will remain in
the output molecule.

<h3><a name="SaltDisc">Salt Disconnection</a></h3>

<p>For metal salts, multiple drawing conventions are sometimes used. For many
computational purposes, it is desirable to prevent salts from being drawn in
their covalent form, e.g. Na(+).Cl(-) is preferable to Na-Cl.

<p>The washing rules used for converting covalently bound atom pairs into ionic
salts are conservative, and only apply if all the following conditions are met:

<ul>

<li>The electropositive element is one of Li, Na, K, Rb or Cs

<li>The electronegative element is one of C, N, O, F, P, S, Cl, Se, Br, I

<li>Both elements have an ionic charge of 0

<li>The electropositive element is terminal

<li>Both atoms are connected by a single bond

</ul>

<p>For any atom pair where all these conditions are satisfied, the bond is
removed, the electropositive atom is set to +1 and the electronegative atom to
-1.

<h3><a name="RemMinor">Removal of Minor Components</a></h3>

<p>For many purposes, it is necessary to ensure that there is only one connected
component in the final output, which typically involves removing salts
(including those which may have been algorithmically disconnected, see
previous section), small
adducts and solvent molecules. The method used to determine which is the major
component is to count the number of heavy atoms in each fully bonded set of
atoms, and keep only that which has the largest number. In the event of a draw,
the first component is retained.

<p>If the database contains major components which have fewer heavy atoms than
the unwanted components, then this feature will not produce the desired result
for these cases.

<h3><a name="AcidBase">Acids and Bases</a></h3>

<p>Protonation state of certain functional groups can be adjusted to the most
probable state in an aqueous environment by enabling the deprotonation of strong
acids and protonation of strong bases.

<p>Certain functional groups are considered to be always protonated or always
deprotonated when dissolved in near-neutral water. If these options are enabled,
they will be adjusted accordingly.

<p>For functional groups which have a pKa of close to 7, which cannot reasonably
be classified as being exclusively protonated or deprotonated, no modifications
are made, and the protonation state of the input molecule is taken to be
instructive.

<p>The following functional motifs may be classified as being either strong
acids or strong bases:

<div align="center">
<table cellpadding="5">
<tr><th>Acids<th>Bases
<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="wash/acids.png">&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="wash/bases.png">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</table>
</div>

<p>For hydroxy acids, the <b>X</b> attachment is defined to be a conjugated
electron withdrawing group which is analogous to a carbonyl substituent. Amines
are also considered acidic if they have two strongly electron withdrawing
substituents. 

<p>A subset of nitrogen centers are considered to be basic. Any amine which has
a combination hydrogen and sp3 carbon substituents is considered a strong base.
N=C-N centers are considered basic if they are aliphatic and do not feature
electron withdrawing substituents.

<p>An option exists to neutralize acids and bases.  First, an attempt is made
to find a protonation state in which all the atoms are neutral.  If this
proves impossible, then an attempt is made to find a protonation state
in which the species is neutral overall.  If this also fails,
the least charge-bearing form of the structure is determined.

<h3><a name="TautProt">Tautomers and Protomers</a></h3>

<p>Many molecular species exist in solution as an ensemble of tautomers and
protonation states, and for some purposes it is not sufficient to assume that a
single variation of the structure is sufficiently representative to describe the
properties of the molecule. It is possible to use the Database Wash application
to enumerate the set of kinetically accessible tautomers, and optionally produce
all of the titration states of acidic or basic functional groups.

<p>The tautomer &amp; protomer enumeration algorithm is based on a collection of
molecular transformations, which match particular functional areas of interest,
and modify some of the regional molecular properties, which may include
hydrogen count, charge and bond order. The transformations are divided into
three distinct types:

<ul>

<li>Tautomer isomerizations, which involve the movement of a single hydrogen
atom and some number of double bonds

<li>Resonance charge migration, which involves the movement of an ionic charge
and some number of double bonds

<li>Protonation or deprotonation, which involves adding or subtracting a single
proton

</ul>

<p>The algorithm for generating tautomers is a stepwise breadth first search,
which proceeds as follows:

<ol>

<li>Define result set as containing the input structure only

<li>Produce a new set by applying all available transforms to all of the
molecules which were added to the result set in the previous iteration

<li>Exclude any new results which have appeared before

<li>If no new results remain, stop

<li>Append new set to result set

<li>Go to 2 and repeat.

</ol>

<p>The enumeration process therefore collects derivative species which are
further separated from the original input structure with each iteration, but are
otherwise not ordered. Due to the nature of the algorithm used, it is necessary
to use a cutoff value for the number of results which may be returned, since the
number of possible results is exponentially dependent on the number of certain
moieties (e.g. a molecule which has 8 isolated ketone-enol opportunities and no
symmetry will have no less than 256 possible tautomers; when enumerating
protomers as well, the presence of large numbers of basic and/or acidic
functional groups also causes a combinatorial explosion).

<p>The transformation rules for tautomers have been implemented from a
literature report on tautomer generation [Selzer 2006], with minor
modifications.

<p>Resonance equivalence for charged species are modeled on the following
templates, with other elements being able to substitute for nitrogen or
oxygen in some cases:

<p><div align="center"><img src="wash/resonance.png"></div>

<p>Multiple resonance forms of the same molecular species may be enumerated
during the operation of the algorithm, and may lead to the production of
otherwise unobtainable tautomers or protomers, but they are themselves
considered degenerate representations of the same molecule, so only one instance
of each is retained in the final output. For this reason, the resonance
enumeration is largely invisible to the user.

<p>A number of functional groups containing polar hydrogen atoms are considered
worth enumerating in both the acid form and as the conjugate base. Some examples
of recognized patterns are shown below:

<div align="center"><table cellpadding="5">
<tr><th>(1)<td><img src="wash/wacid1.png">
<tr><th>(2)<td><img src="wash/wacid2.png">
<tr><th>(3)<td><img src="wash/wacid3.png">
<tr><th>(4)<td><img src="wash/wacid4.png">
<tr><th>(5)<td><img src="wash/wacid5.png">
</table></div>

<p>Hydroxy substituents are deprotonated when they are close to a conjugated
electron withdrawing moiety, such as in carboxylic acids or conjugated diketone
tautomers (1). Similarly, -OH substituents attached to certain inorganic centers
such as oxidized phosphorus and sulfur are deprotonated (2). Phenols and
thiophenols are considered to be not worth enumerating, unless an electron
withdrawing substituent is found in the <i>ortho</i> or <i>para</i> position
(3). C-hydroxy and N-hydroxy patterns of small oxidized nitrogen-containing
functional groups are typically enumerated (4). The tetrazole functional group
is known to be acidic, and will be reversibly deprotonated, but less
nitrogen-substituted heterocycles will not be (5).

<p>A small number of nitrogen-containing structural motifs are considered
suitably basic to be worth enumerating both protonated and unprotonated forms:
<div align="center"><table cellpadding="5">
<tr><th>(1)<td><img src="wash/wbase1.png">
<tr><th>(2)<td><img src="wash/wbase2.png">
<tr><th>(3)<td><img src="wash/wbase3.png">
<tr><th>(4)<td><img src="wash/wbase4.png">
</table></div>

<p>Primary amines which are bonded to a combination of hydrogen or sp3 carbon
atoms are considered basic, while those with non-sp3 carbon substituents are not
(1). N-C=N structural fragments are reversibly protonated, but only if none of
the constituent atoms are in a pi-ring (2). The 4-aminopyridine fragment is
reversibly protonated on two sites (3). Imidazole is considered basic and is
protonated, unless the 5-membered ring is fused to a larger aromatic system (4).

<h2><a name="Panel">Running the Application</a></h2>

<p>A MOE database can be submitted to the wash procedure by selecting
<span class="nobr"><b>DBV | Compute | Molecule | Wash...</b></span>,
which brings up the following panel:

<p><div align="center"><img src="wash/panel.png"></div>

<p><table width="100%" cellpadding="5">

<tr>
<td valign=top><span class="nobr"><b>Selected Entries Only</b></span>
<td valign=top>

If on, and the source database has at least one selected entry, then only
the selected entries will be affected by the wash operation.

<tr>
<td valign=top><b>Source Field</b>
<td valign=top>

The molecular input for the wash operation must be specified. By default,
this is the first field of type <tt>molecule</tt> in the database. Any of the
molecular fields may be chosen. Alternatively, the molecule source may be given
as a SMILES string, read from a particular field in the database. Note that if a
SMILES field is used as the input, it is necessary to select a different field
for the destination.

<tr>
<td valign=top><b>Destination Field</b>
<td valign=top>

If the Destination Field is non-blank, then it will be used as the name of
the molecule-type field to which the result of the wash operation will be
written. Otherwise, the result of the wash operation is used to overwrite the
Source Field, if not running in an enumerative mode, or to a field in the
output database with the same name as the value of Source Field in the case of
enumeration. 

<p>If the molecule source is a SMILES string, and a non-enumerative mode is
being used, then a different field name must be specified.

<tr>
<td valign=top><b>Name From</b>
<td valign=top>

A field name may optionally be specified to use as a replacement for the name
of the molecule. The name may be left unchanged,
derived from a SMILES string, left empty, or taken from a field.

<tr>
<td valign=top><b>Output Database</b>
<td valign=top>

A database other than the source may be specified to contain the results of
the wash procedure. If the wash is performed in one of the enumerative modes, it
is mandatory to specify an output database which is different from the input.
The output database will be overwritten when the operation begins.

<tr>
<td valign=top><b>Open in Database Viewer</b>
<td valign=top>

If on, then the output database will be opened in the database viewer when
the wash procedure commences.

<tr>
<td valign=top><b>Fragments</b>
<td valign=top>

If <span class="nobr"><b>Disconnect Group I Metals</b></span> is enabled, then certain
salts are converted from covalent bond notation into ionic salt notation, which
causes the number of components in the system to increase. If
<span class="nobr"><b>Keep Only Largest Molecular Fragment</b></span>
is enabled, then the next step is to
remove all but the largest connected component (defined by having the greatest
number of heavy atoms) in the main molecule field. If
<span class="nobr"><b>Save Deleted Fragments in Field</b></span>
is on, then the corresponding field name is used
to create a molecule field which will store the excised components.

<tr>
<td valign=top><b>Tautomers</b>
<td valign=top>

If the <b>Enumerate Tautomers</b> option is on, the wash procedure will
be conducted in enumerative mode, which means that for each processed entry in
the source database, 1-or-more resulting structures will be produced. These will
be written to the output database, which must be specified.

<p>The maximum number of enumerated results is given as <b>Limit</b>, beyond
which the enumeration will be prematurely terminated.

<p>By default, only tautomers are enumerated, which means that the enumeration
will produce structures which have the same molecular formula, but different
hydrogen atom connectivity. If
<span class="nobr"><b>Enumerate Protonation States</b></span>
is on, then in addition to enumerating tautomers, charge and hydrogen counts
will also vary. Enabling enumeration of protonation states produces as many or
more results per input structure than enumeration of tautomers alone.

<p>If <b>Add Sequence Number to Output</b> is on, then the output database will
contain a field called <tt>pseq</tt> which divides the results into
blocks corresponding to the source entry number.

<p>By default, the enumeration procedure automatically prunes results which are
duplicates due to symmetry or to ZQH equivalence (a measurement based on
the atomic number, heavy valence, total hydrogen count of the atoms, and 
the molecular connectivity). If the
<span class="nobr"><b>Allow Topological Duplicates</b></span>
option is on, then results which are
equivalent by topological symmetry will not be removed. This is useful if the
atom indices have special meaning, or if the molecules have 3D conformations
with lower symmetry than the topological connectivity.


<tr>
<td valign=top><b>Protonation</b>
<td valign=top>

If <b>Neutralize Protonated Molecules</b> is on, charged species
will be replaced with:

<p>
<ul>
<li>A protonation state in which all the atoms are
neutral, if possible; otherwise
<li>A protonation state in which the species is
neutral overall, if possible; otherwise
<li>The least charge-bearing form of the structure.
</ul>

<p>If <span class="nobr"><b>Deprotonate Strong Acids</b></span> is on, then
functional groups
which are deemed to be strong acids will have a proton removed, during the early
stages of the wash process. If one of the enumeration modes is selected, then
the results of the enumeration will be screened to remove molecules which
contain a strong acid functional group. Enabling this option is appropriate
when the species being studied are expected to behave as if they were in neutral
or basic aqueous solution.

<p>The <span class="nobr"><b>Protonate Strong Bases</b></span> option is the
logical opposite
of the above, which causes strong bases to be protonated.

<p>The sets of strong
acids and strong bases are mutually exclusive, but there are many functional
groups which classify as neither, so enabling both of the above options is an
approximate way of selecting the species which is most representative of the
molecule as it exists in water. When combined with protomer enumeration, the
result is that some of the enumerated protonation states may be pruned on
account of having acidity or basicity that is too high, hence the remaining
species are those which are likely to have at least a modest population in
aqueous solution.

<tr>
<td valign=top><b>Hydrogens</b>
<td valign=top>

If <span class="nobr"><b>Add Explicit Hydrogens</b></span> is on,
then hydrogen-suppressed molecular
representations will have the requisite number of hydrogen atoms added. New
hydrogen atoms are added at the end of the atom list. The manner in which the
coordinates of new hydrogen atoms are determined depends on other options:

<ul>

<li>If depiction is on, hydrogen atoms are positioned during the depiction
layout process;

<li>If the structure is non-planar, then the hydrogen atoms are placed  in 3D,
using the same algorithm as the <a href="../moe/fcnref/addh.html">Add_H</a>
function;

<li>If the structure is planar, then hydrogen atoms are placed as if the
molecule were already drawn in a sketch-like manner, using the same algorithm as
is used by the <a href="../moe/fcnref/depictor.htm">DepictionCoordinates</a>
function;

<li>If the structure has no coordinates (all zero), then no meaningful hydrogen
placement is attempted.

</ul>

<p>For heavy atoms for which the number of attached explicit hydrogen atoms is
greater than the number implied by valence rules, hydrogen atoms are neither
added nor removed.

<p>If <b>Delete Explicit Hydrogens</b> is on, then selected explicit hydrogen
atoms are removed. The selection of hydrogen atoms which may be safely deleted
is described <a href="#Hydrogen">above</a>.

<p>Note that if one of the enumeration modes is enabled, the hydrogen atoms are
always removed immediately prior to the enumeration. If
<span class="nobr"><b>Add Explicit Hydrogens</b></span>
is enabled, the hydrogen atoms will be re-added back
individually for each enumerated case, since the number of hydrogen atoms
varies.

<tr>
<td valign=top><b>Coordinates</b>
<td valign=top>

If <span class="nobr">
<b>Replace Coordinates with a Generated 2D Depiction</b>
</span> is on,
the coordinates of the washed species will be replaced by the results of
the 2D depiction layout algorithm. If off, the coordinates of the
original atoms will not be modified. If the wash is enumerative,
the depiction layout will be performed for the input molecule immediately
prior to the enumeration step, and the same heavy-atom coordinates will
be used for all of the tautomers and protomers.

<p>If <b>Scale to Reasonable Bond Lengths</b> is on, molecule coordinates
will be scaled so that the average bond length is characteristic of a 2D
diagram layout.  This is useful when the source molecules have abnormally
short bond lengths as produced by some drawing programs.
