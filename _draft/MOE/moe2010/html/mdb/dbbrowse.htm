<h2>Database Browser</h2>

<a name="Browser"></a>
<h2>The Database Browser</h2>

<p>The Database Browser is used to view fields within a MOE database, one entry
at a time. Usually fields are viewed individually using the default field
viewers, but specially-created databases may install additional viewing modes.

<p>To open the browser, choose <b><nobr>DBV | File | Browse</nobr></b> in the
Database Viewer.

<p>By default, each field in the MOE database is bound to either one or two
viewers, which present the content of a single field in the <b>Subject</b>
option. Databases which have been created by special applications may have their
own viewers installed in addition to these.

</center>

<p>In most cases the 3D molecule is the default subject, as shown above. The 3D
viewer is always available for fields of type <tt>molecule</tt>. The browser
displays molecule data by instantiating the molecular species in the MOE
Window.

<p> Ordinarily when browsing in 3D, the molecule will be removed from the
MOE Window when the database browser is closed, or a different
entry is selected. Pressing the <b>Keep</b> button causes the molecule to remain
in the MOE Window when it would otherwise be deleted.

<p>Molecules are also associated with a 2D viewer, which will render in a manner
similar to that shown below:

<p><center>
<img src="dbbrowse/browse2.png" alt="Database Browser Panel">
</center>

<p>2D molecule views, and scalar fields, are rendered within the Database
Browser panel rather than in the MOE Window.

<p>Customized views may manifest themselves in the MOE Window or the
Database Browser panel (for example, see the section on
on <a href="#Animating_Molecular_Dynamics">animating molecular
dynamics</a> below), or a combination of both.

<p>The Database Browser supports the following intrinsic features:

<p><table width="100%" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5">

<tr><th valign="top" align="left">Database</th><td>

The filename of the current database being browsed.

</td></tr><tr><th valign="top" align="left">Subject</th>

<td>The identifier name for the viewer instance. All databases provide 3D and 2D
viewer instances for each of their fields for which the type is
<tt>molecule</tt>, and a simple scalar viewer instance for each of the fields of
type <tt>byte</tt>, <tt>int</tt>, <tt>float</tt>, <tt>double</tt> and
<tt>char</tt>.

<p>Additional viewers may be available if the database was created by a
custom application, such as Molecular Dynamics or Pharmacophore Elucidation.

</td></tr><tr><th valign="top" align="left">Entry</th>

<td>The entry number in the database may be selected using the slider control,
or by entering the number in the text field to the right. The navigation buttons
at the bottom of the panel can also be used.

</td></tr><tr><th valign="top" align="left">Selected</th>

<td>If the database is also open with the Database Viewer, the selection state
of the presently browsed entry is reflected by the state of the Selected
checkbox. If it is changed in the Database Browser, the Database Viewer will
also note the change.

</td></tr><tr><th valign="top" align="left">Browse&nbsp;Selected</th>

<td>The domain of entries to which the browser is restricted is one of the
following three possibilities:

<ul>

<li><p>If the database being browsed is not also open with the Database Viewer,
then all of the records are browsed.

<li><p>If the Browse Selected box is not checked, or there are no selected entries,
the set of browsed entries is all which are visible in the Database Viewer.

<li><p>If the Browse Selected box is checked and at least one entry is selected,
the entries browsed are restricted to selected entries only.

</ul>

</td></tr><tr><th valign="top" align="left">Center&nbsp;View</th>

<td>(3D viewer only) If checked, the MOE Window will be centered and
aligned to show the browsed molecule.

</td></tr><tr><th valign="top" align="left">Layout&nbsp;Coordinates</th>

<td>(2D viewer only) If checked, the molecule will be redrawn in 2D by calling
the <tt>DepictionCoordinates</tt> function prior to displaying it in the panel.
Otherwise, the (X,Y) coordinates from the structure in the database will be
used.

<h2>Animating Molecular Dynamics</h2>

<p>
Databases created by the <a href="../apps/md.htm">Molecular Dynamics</a>
application support a special dynamics animation viewing mode in the
Database Browser.
In such databases, the Database Browser opens,
by default, with <b>Subject</b> set to <b>Dynamics</b>.
The basic mode features of the Database Browser are still available,
as appropriate, when Subject is changed to some other field. 
</p>

<p>
In Dynamics mode, the panel appears as follows:
</p>

<p>
<center>
<img src="dbbrowse/md_browser.png" alt="Database Browser MD Animation Mode" />
</center>
</p>

<p>The additional options are:
</p>

<p><table width="100%" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5">

<tr><th valign="top" align="left">Animation</th>
<td>
The animation wheel controls the speed of the animation, i.e. the
speed at which the different conformations are loaded into MOE.
</td>
</tr>

<tr><th valign="top" align="left">Loop</th>
<td>
If on, the animation will run continuously, returning to the
beginning of the database when the end of the database has been reached,
or vice-versa if <b>Reverse</b> is on.
If off, the animation will stop when the end of the database is reached.
</td>
</tr>

<tr><th valign="top" align="left">Reverse</th>
<td>
If on, the animation will run from the end of the database
backwards to the beginning, i.e. time will run in reverse.
If off, the animation will run forwards from the start of
the database.
</td>
</tr>

</table>
