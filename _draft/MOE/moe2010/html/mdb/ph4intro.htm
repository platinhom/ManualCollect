<a name="Basics"></a><h2>Fingerprint Basics</h2>

<p>
Elements known as <i>structural keys</i>, <i>signatures</i>, or
<i>molecular fingerprints</i> (or, more simply, <i>fingerprints</i>)
represent a set of features derived from the structure of a molecule.  The
particular features calculated from the structure can be quite arbitrary
and depend on the topology of the chemical graph or even a 3D
conformation.  Different fingerprint schemes emphasize different molecular
attributes according to the design philosophy of the fingerprint system.
The fundamental idea is to encapsulate certain properties directly or
indirectly in the fingerprint and then use the fingerprint as a surrogate
for the chemical structure.  Comparisons between molecules are then
reduced to comparing sets of features and measuring the degree to which
sets overlap.</p>

<p>MOE Fingerprints can be used for </p>
<ol>
<li><a href="ph4clust.htm">Fingerprint Clustering</a> to group molecules
based on the similarity of their fingerprint.
<li><a href="fpmodel.htm">Fingerprint Models</a> to study Quantitative 
Structure Activity Relationships using fingerprint descriptions of the
molecules.
<li><a href="ph4sim.htm">Similarity Searching</a> to find molecules with
similar fingerprints.
</ol>

<p>
As a simple example, consider a universe of features consisting of:</p>

<p><center>
    <i>U</i> = { is-aromatic, has-ring, has-C, has-N,
		  has-O, has-S, has-P, has-halogen
		}
</center></p>

<p>
Based on this definition of features, <i>all</i> molecules are described by
subsets of <i>U</i>.  Note that, in this small universe of 8 features, there
are only 2<sup>8</sup> (256) possible fingerprints, which means that all
chemical structures will be mapped to one of 256 possible subsets. In other
words, there are only 256 possible "molecules."  Examples might be:</p>

<p><center>
<table border=1 cellpadding=5 width=80%>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td align=center><img src="ph4intro/c6h6.png">
<td align=center>{ is-aromatic, has-ring, has-C }
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td align=center><img src="ph4intro/c4h8.png">
<td align=center>{ has-ring, has-C }
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td align=center><img src="ph4intro/c4no.png">
<td align=center>{ has-C, has-N, has-O }
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td align=center><img src="ph4intro/c4nf.png">
<td align=center>{ is-aromatic, has-ring, has-C, has-N, has-halogen }
</table>
</center></p>

<p>
<b>Metrics.</b>
Once a fingerprint is derived from a chemical structure, a metric
is needed to compare fingerprints (and thus compare molecules).  A common
metric is the <i>Tanimoto coefficient</i>, suitable for use, for example,
in ranking compounds in virtual screening assays.  The Tanimoto coefficient
can take on values between 0 and 1 inclusive,
where 0 means "maximally dissimilar" and 1 means "maximally similar."  The
Tanimoto coefficient between fingerprints <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> is
defined to be:</p>

<p><center> # features in intersect(A,B) / # features in union(A,B)</center></p>

<p>
which is, roughly speaking, the number of common features divided by the
number of total features in both fingerprints.  For example, the Tanimoto
coefficient between molecules 1 and 2 in the above table is:</p>

<p><center>
# { has-ring, has-C } / # { is-aromatic, has-ring, has-C} = 2/3 = 0.666
</center></p>

<p>
The Tanimoto coefficient can be used as a threshold to define similarity; in this case, any value can act
as the threshold. For example, two compounds having a Tanimoto coefficient greater than or equal to 0.6
can be considered "similar."</p>

<p>
The primary concern in designing a fingerprint system is determining what
features to use.  The example above reveals one of the problems with
fingerprints.  The is-aromatic and has-ring features are not independent:
whenever is-aromatic is present has-ring is also present.  This has the
effect of overemphasizing ring structures in the similarity measures (since
each feature is counted with equal weight in the Tanimoto coefficient).
In practical fingerprint systems, the problem remains but becomes more difficult to pinpoint as there may be hundreds or thousands of features.</p>

<p>
<b>Similarity Matrices.</b>
A <i>similarity matrix</i> can be defined for a collection of compounds by
calculating the Tanimoto coefficient between each pair.  For example, the
above collection of four compounds have the following similarity matrix:</p>

<p>
<center><table cellspacing=5 cellpadding=5>
<tr>
<td>1.00<td>0.66<td>0.20<td>0.60
<tr>
<td>0.66<td>1.00<td>0.25<td>0.40
<tr>
<td>0.20<td>0.25<td>1.00<td>0.33
<tr>
<td>0.60<td>0.40<td>0.33<td>1.00
</table></center></p>

<p>
Each element (<i>i</i>,<i>j</i>) is the Tanimoto coefficient between molecules
<i>i</i> and <i>j</i>.  The similarity matrix has a number of uses.  In
particular, it can be used to cluster compounds by partitioning them into
subsets such that each subset consists of molecules that are mutually similar.
It can also be used to calculate Euclidean vectors whose inter-vector
distances approximate the similarity matrix (this is called Euclidean
Embedding).</p>

<p>
<b>Representations.</b>
In computational procedures, fingerprints are not represented as collections
of character strings.  The fundamental quantity to represent
is the <i>set</i>, which can be done in a number of ways:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Bit Vectors</i>.  In the bit vector set representation, each feature in
the universe <i>U</i> is assigned a natural number {1,2,3,...,<i>n</i>} where
<i>n</i> is the total number of features in the universe.  Any subset of
<i>U</i> can then be represented by an <i>n</i>-vector, <i>x</i>, of ones and
zeros where <i>x<sub>i</sub></i> = 1 if and only if feature <i>i</i> is in the
set.  This representation is efficient since eight features can be encoded in
one byte and similarity metrics consist of AND and OR operations on the bits.

<li><i>Folded Bit Vectors</i>.  One of the drawbacks of the bit vector
representation is memory consumption.  If the universe consists of 1,000,000
features, then every set (no matter how small) requires 1,000,000/8 = 125,000
bytes of storage.  One way around this is to <i>fold</i> the bit vectors,
i.e. map them onto a lower dimensional bit-vector.  For example, if we
allocate 1,000 bits per fingerprint, then each bit becomes a "bucket,"
i.e. it represents many other bits in the full bit vector.  Thus, if a
bit is 1, one is not sure of exactly which feature is contained in the feature
set; however, in practice, such "collisions" can be neglected in certain
applications.

<li><i>Feature Lists</i>.  Another way of getting around the sparseness of the
feature set for an individual compound (most molecules rarely contain a large
proportion of the total feature universe) is to store each set as a list of
feature numbers.  Assign a unique integer to each feature and store the
resulting fingerprint as a variable length list of integers.  Thus, small
molecules generally use up less memory than large molecules; however, each
feature will require 1 word of computer memory to store.

</ul>

<p>
Ultimately, the representation of a fingerprint will depend on the total number
of features in the universe <i>U</i> and the average number of features present
in an individual molecule.</p>


<a name="System"></a><h2>MOE Fingerprint System</h2>

<p>
Several fingerprint systems are implemented in MOE.  Moreover,
additional systems can be implemented in SVL, thereby extending the list of
core fingerprint systems.  Applications that use fingerprints will
generally offer the choice of all available fingerprint methods in MOE.
This is done by assigning a unique code, or name, to each fingerprint
system.  Each fingerprint system will support a number of similarity metrics
and use different representations.  Typically, selection of fingerprints
and metrics is performed in a Fingerprint Chooser panel:</p>

<p><center>
<img src="ph4intro/choose_sim.png" alt="Fingerprint Chooser (Cluster) Panel">
</center></p>

<p>
The top list allows selection of the fingerprint system while the
bottom list allows selection of a comparison metric (once a fingerprint
has been chosen).  A MOE fingerprint system is defined by the following
quantities:</p>

<p>
<table cellpadding=5>
<tr>
<td valign="baseline"><tt><b>fp_code</b></tt></td>
<td valign="baseline">
Unique name of the fingerprint system, for example, <tt>FP:MACCS</tt>
for the 166 MACCS keys fingerprint system.  The purpose of the code name
is to identify fingerprint systems and indicate which molecular database
fields contain the fingerprints themselves.  In general, if a database
has a field with the code name then it is assumed that the contents of the
field are correct fingerprints.
</td>

<tr>
<td valign="baseline"><tt><b>fp_desc</b></tt>
</td>
<td valign="baseline">

will appear in option lists and list boxes where a choice of fingerprints
is given by an application.
</td>

<tr>
<td valign="baseline"><tt><b>fp_fcn</b></tt>
</td>
<td valign="baseline">
Name of the SVL function that actually calculates the fingerprints
from loaded molecules.  Generally speaking, this is mostly of interest to fingerprint
developers.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="baseline"><tt><b>fp_sim</b></tt>
</td>
<td valign="baseline">
List of similarity metrics that are supported
by the fingerprint system.  Each metric has a name and a one-line description.
Suppose that two fingerprints are given, A and B.  Let #A denote the number of
features in fingerprint A, #B the number of features in fingerprint B, and #AB
the number of common features in A and B.
Metric names and their meanings are given below:
