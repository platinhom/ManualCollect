<h2><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>This chapter explains the basic steps involved in creating and editing
databases containing numeric, text and molecular data entries.  If you are
looking for information on a specific menu or command, click on the links in 
the <a href="db.htm#QuickReference">Database Viewer Menu Bar</a>.

<p>The MOE interface provides several ways of creating databases: 

<ul>

<p><li>In the <a href="../moe/gui/mainwin.htm">MOE Window</a> (and
also in the <a href="../moe/gui/se.html">Sequence Editor</a>), choose
<span class="menu">File | New | Database</span>. 

<p><li>In the Database Viewer, choose
<span class="menu">DBV | File | New</span>. 

</ul>

<p>The following panel appears:
<p><center>
<img src="dbedit/createdb.png" alt="New Database Panel">
</center>

<p>In the <b>New Database</b> panel, specify the path and name of the new
database.  The lower portion of the panel allows you to create three
fields in the new database.  If the name fields are left blank then
no fields will be created.  By default, a single molecule field is
created with the field name of <b>mol</b>.

<p>Press <b>OK</b> to create the new database and open it in a
Database Viewer.

<h2><a name="CreatingFields">Creating Fields</a></h2>
Fields hold numeric, character, or molecular data. Operations on fields
are done via the Edit menu or the Field Popup menu (position the cursor
over the field name and press the 
<a href="../moe/gui/mouse.html#MousePopupButton">mouse popup button</a>).

<ol>

<p><li>In the Database Viewer, choose
<span class="menu">DBV | Edit | New | Field</span>.  You can also
use the
<a href="db.htm#Popups">Field Popup</a> menu:
<span class="menu">DBV | Field Popup | New</span>.


<p>The CLI prompt area will display an option menu with the available 
database data types and a text field for entering the new field name. 
Non-molecule fields (i.e. numeric or character) can also take a
value.  The value will be replicated in the new field across all entries.
</p>

<p><center><img src="dbedit/newfield.png" alt="Create Field Prompt"></center>

<p><li>Select the type of field to create:

<p>
<table width="100%">

<tr>
    <td><tt>int</tt> 
    <td>Numeric
    <td>Integer value or vector of integers
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><tt>float</tt>
    <td>Numeric
    <td>Real number or vector of real numbers (4-byte IEEE floating point data)
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><tt>char</tt>
    <td>Text
    <td>String of characters 
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><tt>byte</tt>
    <td>Numeric
    <td>8-bit numerical value ranging from <tt>-128</tt> to <tt>127</tt> inclusive
</tr>


<tr>
    <td><tt>molecule</tt>
    <td>Molecular
    <td>MOE molecular format (see
<a class="svl" href="../moe/fcnref/extract.htm#mol_Extract">mol_Extract</a>)
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><tt>double</tt>
    <td>Numeric
    <td>Real number or vector of real numbers (8-byte IEEE floating point data)
</tr>
</table>

<p><li>Enter the name of the new field and, if desired,
a value used to initialize the field.  Press <tt>Return</tt> to
create the field.
The field names appear as column labels in the top row of the database. 
You can also use the <b>Apply</b> button to create the field.
Using the <b>OK</b> button will create the field and dismiss the prompter.

<p><li>Repeat this procedure to create as many fields as required by the
database you are creating. Once this is done, you can add entries to the
database, as described below.

</ol>

<a name="Duplicate"></a>
<p>The <span class="menu">Field Popup | Duplicate</span>
command can also be used to create a new field.  In this case, an
exact copy of the field is created.  You will be asked to confirm
the field creation.  The name of the new field is automatically
generated from the original field name by prefixing it with
<tt>'Copy of '</tt>.
If a field of this name already exists, the new field will
be numbered (e.g. <tt>'Copy (2) of...'</tt>).
The new field is positioned immediately to the right of the
original field.
</p>

<p>Multiple fields can be duplicated using
the <span class="menu">Field Popup | Selection | Duplicate</span>
command.  The copied fields are appended, i.e. are positioned
as the rightmost columns of the database.
</p>

<h2><a name="AddingEntries">Adding Entries</a></h2>

<p>Entries are commonly added to a database automatically through
many of MOE's applications.  However, it is often required to add
entries manually to a database in order to store data currently
viewed in the MOE Window.  This section describes how to add
entries to a database and how to filter the system in order to
copy only parts of the system into the new database cells.

<p>To open the Add Entry panel use either of the following commands:

<ul>
<li><span class="menu">DBV | Edit | New | Entry</span>
<li><span class="menu">DBV | Entry Popup | New</span>
</ul>

A panel similar to the following appears:

<p><center>
<img src="dbedit/addentry.png" alt="Add Entry Panel">
</center>


<p>The panel consists of two sections: the
<a href="#Molecular_Field"><b>Molecular Field</b></a>
and the
<a href="#Non_Molecular_Fields"><b>Non-Molecular Fields</b></a>.  If there
are no fields of the specified type then that section will not be displayed.

<p>To add a single new entry with no data initialization, set the <b>Mode</b>
option to <b>None</b> and press <b>OK</b>.  To add a single new
entry with the entire system copied into the specified molecule field,
simply press <b>OK</b>.

<a name="Non_Molecular_Fields"></a>
<h3>Non-Molecular Fields</h3>

<p>The <b>Non-Molecular Fields</b> section displays the non-molecular
fields with text widgets for initialization values.  Note that if the
database has too many non-molecular fields then this list will be
truncated.

<p>To initialize numeric or character entries, enter values in the
appropriate text fields.  All fields are optional. Leaving a blank
field in the panel results in an empty cell in the database (you can
<a href="#EditingNumericAndCharacterCells">edit</a>
the cell contents later).

<a name="Molecular_Field"></a>
<h3>Molecular Field</h3>

<p>Molecular data can be extracted from the MOE system and inserted
into the database using the <b>Molecular Field</b> section.
The MOE system can be entered as a single component or can be split over
several database entries.
The <b>Mode</b> by which the system is broken
down dictates how many new entries will be added to the database.  For
example, <b>Chain</b> mode will create a separate entry for each
distinct chain in the system.
</p>

<p>In addition to splitting up the system over several database entries,
the atoms, residues and chains may be filtered to restrict the extraction
based on visibility and selection states.  Any objects not adhering
to the filter requirements are not extracted.
Two forms of filtering are provided: <b>Visibility</b> and
<b>Selection</b> (with the resulting extraction being their
intersection).
</p>

<center>
<img src="dbedit/molfields.png" alt="Molecular Fields" />
</center>

<p>The molecular data controls are as follows:

<dir>
<table cellpadding="5">
<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Molecule</b>
<td valign="top">The molecule field.

<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Visibility</b>

<td valign="top">
<b>Ignore</b>. Visibility status of atoms and residues is ignored.  All
atoms are considered for extraction.
<br><b>Atoms</b>. Only visible atoms are considered for extraction.
<br><b>Atoms and Ribbons</b>. Only visible atoms and residues whose ribbon
is visible in the MOE Window are considered for extraction.

<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Selection</b>
<td valign="top">
<b>Ignore</b>.  Selection status of atoms, residues and chains is ignored.
All atoms, residues and chains are considered for extraction.
<br><b>Selected Atoms</b>.  Only selected atoms are considered for
extraction.
<br><b>All Selected Objects</b>. Only selected atoms, residues and chains
are considered for extraction.

<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Mode</b>
<td valign="top">
<b>System</b>. Create a single entry with the objects that pass through the
filters.

<br><b>Chain</b>.
Create a separate entry for each chain in the system.  If a chain
is left with no residues after filtering then it is not given an
empty entry.

<br><b>Chain Tag</b>.
Create a separate entry for each distinct chain tag in the system.
Blank chain tags are not grouped together.

<br><b>Chain Name</b>.
Create a separate entry for each distinct chain name in the system.
Blank chain names are not grouped together.

<br><b>Molecule</b>.
Create a separate entry for each connected component in the system.

<br><b>None</b>.  Molecular data is not extracted from the system.

<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Sequence Only</b> 
<td valign="top">If on, only chains and residues will be
extracted. No atom information will be written to the database.
</table>
</dir>

<p>If, after filtering, there are no objects in the system to extract,
then a single empty entry is added to the database.


<h2><a name="EditingNumericAndCharacterCells">Editing Numeric and Character Cells</a></h2>

<img src="dbedit/cell_popup.png" alt="Cell Popup Menu" align="right" vspace="10" hspace="10">

<p>Numeric or character data can be edited by
double-clicking in the data cell or using
<span class="menu">Cell Popup | Edit</span>.
If the cell contains a single line of text or a single number or
short series of numbers,
the CLI will change to the Edit prompt.  In the prompt,
the field name and entry number are
indicated. Enter the new value and press <tt>Return</tt> or
<b>Apply</b> to update the
cell.  Note that successive prompts are stacked on top of earlier ones.
Each edit prompt can be canceled individually by
pressing either <tt>Esc</tt> or <b>Cancel</b>.
</p>

<p>For numeric data, the Edit prompt has the following appearance:<p>

<p><center>
<img src="dbedit/editprompt.png" alt="Edit Prompt">
</center>

<p>For character (text) data, the Edit prompt has an additional
<b>Multi-line</b> button which, when pressed, will open a
panel for editing the existing data.</p>

<p><center>
<img src="dbedit/editcharprompt.png" alt="Edit Prompt">
</center>

<p><center><img src="dbedit/editpanel.png" alt="Edit Panel"></center>

<p>This same panel is opened when double-clicking
on a text cell that already contains multi-line text or on
a numeric cell that contains a long series of numbers.
Pressing <tt>Return</tt> in the editor panel will add newline characters.
<p>

<p>Clearing data from a cell can be accomplished by either editing
the cell contents or using
<span class="menu">Cell Popup | Clear</span>.
</p>

<h2><a name="EditingMoleculeCells">Editing Molecule Cells</a></h2>

<div class="floatright">
<img src="dbedit/mol_popup.png" alt="Molecule Cell Popup Menu" />
</div>

<p>Molecular structures in the database cannot be edited;
the only way to modify a molecule stored
in the database is to overwrite it.  From a Database Viewer,
<a href="#CopyToMOE">copy the molecule to MOE</a>, perform the
changes, then <a href="#CopyFromMOE">copy it back</a>
to the database.
To empty the contents of a molecule cell, use the <b>Clear</b> button in
the Molecule Cell Popup.
</p>

<p>The molecule name can, however, be modified.  Please
refer to the section on
<a href="#MoleculeNames">Extracting and Modifying Molecule Names</a>
below.

<p><span class="tip">Caution!</span>
All edits are written directly to the database file on
disk. No backups are made, and previous data is irrevocably lost.


<h3><a name="CopyToMOE"></a>Copying Molecules From the Database to MOE</h3>

<p>To copy a database molecule to MOE, you can either
double-click within the molecule
cell or select the <span class="menu">Send to MOE</span> command from the
Molecule Cell Popup menu.
In either case, you will be asked
to confirm whether to clear the system before loading the molecule.
The molecules that are copied to MOE will come from the field
where the popup was issued.
</p>

<p>Sequence-only data (i.e. residue information only, no atomic data)
can similarly be copied into MOE using
<span class="menu">Molecule Cell Popup | Send SEQ to MOE</span>.
If several entries are currently selected, the molecules from all
selected entries can be copied into MOE at once using 
<span class="menu">Molecule Cell Popup | Selected to MOE</span>.
</p>

<p>Copying to MOE can also be achieved using the
<a href="#Copying_and_Pasting_Using_the_Clipboard">clipboard</a>.

<p>You can also copy molecules from selected entries
in the database to MOE by choosing
<span class="menu">Copy Selected to MOE</span></b>
in the Molecule Cell Popup.  
If there is more than one molecular data field in the database,
remember that selected entries copied to MOE relate to the field
(i.e. column) in which the cursor was positioned when displaying
the popup.
-->

<p><b>Note:</b> Changes to the molecule in MOE
are not reflected in the Database Viewer and do not modify the database
data on disk. To change the database data, you must copy the molecule back
to the database from the MOE system.</p>

<h3><a name="CopyFromMOE"></a>Copying Molecules From MOE to the Database</h3>

<p>The <span class="menu">Get from MOE</span>
command in the Molecule Cell Popup menu is
used to copy a molecule from the MOE system to a specific cell in
the database.   This command opens the
<span class="menu">Copy Molecule from MOE</span> panel:

<p><center>
<img src="dbedit/copyfrommoe.png" alt="Copy Molecule from MOE Panel">
</center>

<p>The panel provides such information as the name of the database as well as
the field name and row (entry) number of the cell
to which the molecule will be copied.
This panel is a simplified version of the Molecular Field section of the
<a href="#AddingEntries">Add Entry</a> panel.
One difference is that the molecular field in which
to write is fixed, having being
set to the field from which the popup originated.
</p>

<p>Copying to MOE can also be achieved using the
<a href="#Copying_and_Pasting_Using_the_Clipboard">clipboard</a>.
</p>

<a name="MoleculeNames"></a><h3>Extracting and Modifying Molecule Names</h3>

<p>Molecule names can be set to a user-specified value or calculated
from the molecule itself.
The <span class="menu">DBV | Compute | Molecule | Molecule Name</span>
command opens the Molecule Name panel which is used to extract
the name or the unique SMILES string of molecules and store the
values in a character field.  Alternatively, the panel can be used to
set the name of a molecule in a molecule field
to the molecule's unique SMILES string, or to the
molecule index in the database, or to the value of a character field.
The database must contain at least one molecular data
field for this computation to succeed.
</p>

<p>The Field Popup menu command
<span class="menu">Molecule Field Popup | Name | Extract</span>
will also open this panel.
</p>

<!--
<p><center><img src="dbedit/molecule_name.png" alt="Molecule Names Panel"></center></p>
-->

<p>The controls in the Molecule Name panel are as follows:

<p><dl>

<p><dt><b>Database</b>
<dd>
Path and filename of the current database which contains
the molecules on which to operate.

<p><dt><b>Selected Entries Only</b>
<dd>Perform the calculation only on entries that
are selected in the Database Viewer.

<p><dt><b>Operation</b>
<dd>The operation specifies whether you will be extracting information
from the molecule field or storing data in the molecule structure located
in the specified molecule field. 
The fields located below this
line will change depending on the operation selected.

<p><b>Extract From Molecule</b>
<p><center><img src="dbedit/molecule_name.png" alt="Molecule Names: Extract From Molecule Page"></center></p>

<dir>
<p><b>Molecule Field</b>.
List of molecular fields in the database. 
Select the field of molecular data to use in the calculations.

<p><b>Output Field</b>. Name of the field that will contain the 
extracted data.  If a field of this name does not exist then one
will be created.  The text contains a shortcut of the character
fields in the database.

<p><b>Extract</b>. The data to extract can be either the
<b>Molecule Name</b> or the unique <b>SMILES</b> string associated
with the molecule.

<p><b>Use chain name if molecule name is empty</b>.
This option is available if the molecule name is the information
being extracted.
If on then the application will first try to extract a molecule name
from the molecule and if no molecule name exists it will search the
chain names until it finds a non-blank chain name to use.
</dir>

<p><b>Store in Molecule</b>
<p><center><img src="dbedit/molname_store.png" alt="Molecule Names: Store in Molecule Page"></center></p>

<dir>
<p><b>Molecule Field</b>.
List of molecular fields in the database. 
Select the field of molecular data to use in the calculations.

<p><b>Name</b>.  The molecule name of the
molecular structure in the molecule field will
be modified to contain one of the following:

<p><ul>
<li><b>SMILES</b>.  The unique SMILES string associated
with the molecule.
<li><b>Index</b>.  The entry number (index in the list of database entries).
<li><b>Field</b>. The string found in the specified field.
The option menu to the right contains
all non-molecular fields.  Choose the field to use for the
name.
<li><b>Clear</b>. Empty.
</ol>

<p><b>Copy name to each chain name</b>.  If on then the new
molecule name will be used to set both the molecule name as well as each
chain name in the molecule.

<p><b>Concatenate to existing name</b>. If on then the
new name will not overwrite the old molecule name.  Instead, the two values
will be concatenated to form a new molecule name.
</dir>

</dl>

<p>The
<span class="menu">Molecule Field Popup | Name | Set</span>
command as well as the
<span class="menu">Molecule Cell Popup | Set Name</span>
command can be used to set the molecule name manually.
These commands display an
editing prompt in the CLI of the database. Enter the new name of the
molecule and press <tt>Return</tt> or <b>Apply</b>.
Remember that to see the molecule name in the molecule field,
the molecule cells must be reduced to a height of one character
(drag the left mouse button to resize the cell).

<li><b>Selected.</b>
Clipboard data will be written to the destination fields of the selected
entries, beginning with the first selected entry.  If the clipboard contains
more rows than there are selected entries, new entries will be appended
to the database.  This mode requires that at least one entry be selected
in the Database Viewer.

Clipboard data will be written as new entries appended to the database.

<p>If the clipboard data is unrecognized, it is treated as
plain text, and the Paste to Clipboard
panel will contain a preview area:

<table border="0" cellpadding="5">

<tr>
<td valign="baseline"><b>Clipboard Data</b></td>
<td valign="baseline">Data preview area.  The header (top line) contains the
field titles, if any.  Each column of data corresponds to a
clipboard data field.  Each row of data represents one
line of clipboard data.  The total number of items on
the clipboard is the number of fields multiplied by the
number of rows.

<td valign="baseline"><b>Format</b></td>
<td valign="baseline">
<div class="floatright">

The field delimiter menu, along with the Field Titles and
Quotes options, specifies how the text data
on the clipboard is to be interpreted.  The chosen delimiter
determines how each row of text is to be broken into fields.
</td>

<tr>
<td valign="baseline"><b>Field Titles</b></td>
<td valign="baseline">
If on, the first row of clipboard data will be used as
field titles.  The titles will appear in the header line
of the preview area.

<td valign="baseline"><b>Quotes</b></td>
<td valign="baseline">
If on, field data will be stripped of any enclosing
double quotes.

<p>
Note: Fields are preferentially pasted to the
fields currently selected in the destination database
and to fields of the same name.
If a field of the same
name is found but is of different type than the
original data, the clipboard data will
be converted to the destination field type before
being pasted.
