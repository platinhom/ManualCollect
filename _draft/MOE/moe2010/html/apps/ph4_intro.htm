<h2>Overview of Pharmacophore Applications</h2>
<hr noshade="noshade" />

<p>
The purpose of the MOE Pharmacophore Application suite is to effect
3D searches of conformation databases using molecule annotations related
to ligand-receptor binding (like, H-bond donor, acceptor, hydrophobe etc.).

A <i>pharmacophore</i> is a set of structural features in a ligand that
are related to the ligand's recognition at a receptor site and its biological
activity.

In MOE, pharmacophoric structural features are represented by labeled points
in space about a conformation of the ligand.  Each ligand conformation is
assigned a set <i>annotation points</i>, which is a set of structural features
that may contribute to the ligand's pharmacophore.

A database of conformations can be searched with a <i>query</i> that
represents a pharmacophore hypothesis.  The result of such a search is a
set of matches that align the pharmacophoric features of the query to the
pharmacophoric features present in the ligands of the searched database.
</p>

<p>
In this document we present an overview of the Pharmacophore Discovery
applications and the steps required to conduct 3D Pharmacophore searches.
First, however, some definition of terms is required.
</p>

<ul>
<li>A <i>ligand annotation</i>
is a set of points in space with attached labels that reflect the
presence or absence of pharmacophore features at those locations.  Each
ligand conformation in a database is annotated at search time (on the fly).
The ligand annotation is what the Pharmacophore Search procedure
&quot;sees&quot; during a search.
</li>
<li>A <i>pharmacophore annotation scheme</i>,
or more simply a <i>scheme</i>, is an automatic procedure to compute
pharmacophore annotation points (such as h-bond donor, h-bond acceptor,
hydrophobe, etc.) that make up a ligand annotation.
MOE contains a number of schemes encoding different methods of ligand
annotation.
</li>
<li>A <i>pharmacophore query</i> is a collection of restrictions imposed
upon a ligand annotation and the atoms of a molecule.
The purpose of the query is to select a limited subset from a given set
of ligand conformations such that all restrictions of the query are satisfied.
Queries can be created interactively using the
Pharmacophore Query Editor.
Queries can be created automatically using the
Pharmacophore Elucidator.
</li>
<li>A <i>match</i> (or <i>hit</i>)
is the occurrence of a ligand conformation satisfying a query.  A match
is the successful mapping of the query features to ligand annotation
points, including the corresponding alignment of the ligand with the
query such that all restrictions of the query are satisfied.  There can
be several different ways in which a given query can match a ligand.
Hits are found and reported by the
Pharmacophore Search application.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The intended usage of the Pharmacophore Applications is as follows.
</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Generate Conformations</b>.
Generate a database of 3D conformations for all molecules that will be
the subject of future pharmacophore searches.
Existing conformation databases may be searched
(such as those distributed with MOE or generated by other programs).
See <a href="confgui.htm">High Throughput Conformation Generation</a>
for more information.
</li>
<li><b>Create a Pharmacophore Query</b>.
Using one of the <a href="ph4_annot.htm">Pharmacophore Annotation Schemes</a>
and the interactive <a href="ph4_query.htm">Pharmacophore Query Editor</a>
or the automatic <a href="ph4_elu.htm">Pharmacophore Elucidator</a>
create a pharmacophore query.
</li>
<li><b>Search the Conformation Database</b>.
Using the <a href="ph4_search.htm">Pharmacophore Search</a> application,
search the conformation database using the created query and obtain
a database of hits.
</li>
<li><b>Refine the Query</b>.
If required, modify the query and use
<a href="ph4_search.htm">Pharmacophore Search</a> on the same database, or
search the generated database of hits with a more restrictive query.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
<a href="confgui.htm"><b>Pharmacophore Conformation Databases</b></a>.
The Pharmacophore Applications operate on databases of 3D conformations.
Typically, these databases are stored in
<a href="../mdb/db.htm">MOE Molecular Database</a>
format (for speed).  Conformations may be stored in a one-conformation-per
entry format or a one-molecule-per entry format.  The latter format allows for
compression of the conformation data.  Alternatively, externally generated
conformation databases can be searched (such as OMEGA databases, for more 
information see <a href="ph4_search.htm#Methodology">Pharmacophore Search</a>).
MOE will annotate molecule conformations during the search; consequently,
no preprocessing or indexing of the conformation databases is required.
In addition, the conformation databases may be distributed over the
nodes of a cluster of computers allowing for parallel search capabilities.
</p>

<p>
<a href="ph4_query.htm"><b>Pharmacophore Query Editor</b></a>.
The purpose of the Pharmacophore Query Editor is to manually create a query
consisting of a set of constraints on the location and type of ligand
annotations which can then be used to search and filter a conformation database.
The main characteristics of the Pharmacophore Query Editor are: 
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Interactive Modification</b>.
The positions, radii, as well as other characteristics of the pharmacophore
query can be interactively adjusted.
</li>

<li><b>Template Ligand</b>.
A ligand (possibly in complex with a receptor) can optionally be used as a
"template" to simplify defining the features of a query.
</li>

<li><b>Template Receptor</b>.
A receptor can optionally be used to help identify key interactions
or as a template to simplify defining excluded volume constraints or
other shape constraints.
</li>

<li><b>Consensus Features</b>.
A set of aligned molecules can be used to suggest a consensus set
of pharmacophore query features.
Suggested features can be visually examined on the screen
and selectively converted into features of an edited query.
</li>

<li><b>Custom Rendering</b>.
The visual characteristics (like color) of the displayed query features and
volumes can be individually adjusted. 
The annotation points of template molecules can be customized.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<a href="ph4_elu.htm"><b>Pharmacophore Elucidator</b></a>.
The purpose of the Pharmacophore Elucidator is to generate a collection of
pharmacophore queries from a collection of compounds some or all of which
are active against a particular biological target such that all or most
of the active compounds satisfy the generated queries.
In the absence of receptor information, it is hoped that feature geometries
common to many of the actives will contain information related to the
important interactions between the bound conformations of the actives and
the receptor.
The fundamental approach for Pharmacophore Elucidation is to exhaustively
search for all pharmacophore queries that induce a good overlay of most of
the active molecules and separate actives from inactives (when inactives
are presented).
Thus, the plausibility of the pharmacophore is measured by overlay of
actives (common binding mode) and the relationship to activity is
measured by classification accuracy. 
</p>

<p>
<a href="ph4_elu.htm"><b>Pharmacophore Search</b></a>.
The purpose of the Pharmacophore Search is to use a pharmacophore query
to filter databases of 3D conformations based on the positions of annotation
points derived from each of the conformations.
The main characteristics of the Pharmacophore Search are:
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Boolean Expressions</b>.
Query features can contain boolean expressions to encode concepts
such as &quot;Donor and not Cationic&quot;.
</li>

<li><b>Substructure Matching</b>.
Pharmacophore query features can be augmented with a
<a href="../moe/molsystems/smiles.html#SMARTS">SMARTS</a>
patterns to search for particular functional groups. The substructure tests are
efficiently performed during the search itself (not as a post-filter).
</li>

<li><b>Volume and Shape Filtering</b>.
The query can be focused by adding restrictions on the shape of
the matched ligands in the form of a union of spheres.  Alternatively,
ligand hits can be filtered to enforce shape occupancy.  SMARTS patterns
can be applied to individual volume and shape constraints.
</li>

<li><b>Partial Matching</b>.
Only those features of the query that are marked as "essential" must be
matched to a corresponding ligand annotation point.  Other query features
may be left unmatched, resulting in a "partial match".  The search
outputs all partial matches of the query that contain at least a given
minimum number of matched features.
</li>

<li><b>Group Constraints</b>.
Match constraints can be applied to, for example,
match &quot;exactly one of&quot; a subset of features,
or to impose that a hydrogen bond heavy atom matches with its
projected feature simultaneously.
</li>

<li><b>Existing Conformations</b>.
External conformation databases can be searched efficiently since no
indexing or prior preparation steps are required.
</li>

<li><b>Systematic Matching</b>.
All possible matches of a ligand conformation and the query are
systematically examined (and are reproducible).
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<a href="ph4_annot.htm"><b>Pharmacophore Annotation Schemes</b></a>.
Ligand annotations are performed by general purpose SVL functions encoding
the atom typing and geometric rules to annotate 3D conformations.
Consequently, the Pharmacophore Applications can be customized a great
deal:
a)&nbsp;by modifying the atom typing rules; or
b)&nbsp;by modifying the SVL functions that implement the schemes; or
c)&nbsp;by writing new custom schemes in SVL.
