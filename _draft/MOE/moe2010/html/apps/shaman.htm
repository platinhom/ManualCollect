<p>
MedChem Transformations is an approach used to discover novel chemical
structures by applying a set of transformation rules to existing ligands.
Typical transformations might exchange functional groups, or alter all or
part of individual rings while preserving the rest of ligand.
These can be applied iteratively, resulting in cumulative changes to the
starting structures.  If a receptor is available, Forcefield Refinement
can be used to generate bound poses along with various docking scores.
<p>
Individual transformations make small-scale modifications, allowing
local exploration of chemical space surrounding the input structure(s):

<p align="center">
<img src="shaman/transpix1.png" alt="MedChem Transformations Sample" /></p>

In this example, the central piperidine ring is changed into a pyrrolidine
ring, preserving the N-X exit vector and the spiro center.  As you can 
see, the geometries of the two structures are similar.
The user can restrict transformations to specific regions of the ligand,
and can specify QuaSAR Descriptor, Model file and/or pharmacophore query
filters to limit the results.  MedChem Transformations can be used as part
of a ligand-based or structure-based discovery methodology.

<!-- ============================= METHODOLOGY -=========================== -->

<p>
<a name="Method"></a>
<h2>Methodology</h2>

<p> This application applies a set of transformations to input
structures, and evaluates the results against a number of criteria.
This flowchart describes the process, and each step is described below:

<p align="center">
<img src="shaman/shflow.png"
alt="MedChem Transformations Flowchart" /></p>

This can be done iteratively, increasing the number and diversity of
the output structures.  The starting point for MedChem Transformations is
one or more superimposed ligands.  If a receptor is present, the ligands
are assumed to be in the cleft and the pocket atoms are used to constrain
the transformations.  In such cases, Forcefield Refinement and Scoring can
be used to evaluate protein/ligand poses.  Transformations can be localized
by selecting a subset of the ligand's atoms, and the scope of the
transformations can be controlled by setting the number of iterations to use.

<h3>Apply Transformations</h3>
<p>
Following Stewart's work with Drug Guru [Stewart&nbsp;2006],
the set of transformations attempts to encode the medicinal chemistry
expertise of a project team to assist them in developing SAR.  Two kinds
of transformations are present: those that preserve properties (such as
switching bioisosteres) and those that modify properties (such as ring
substitution or homologation).  Care is taken to preserve substituent
geometry wherever possible, and distinctions are made between chain and
ring transformations as appropriate.
<p>
Transformation rules are applied via a <i>match and replace</i> algorithm:
<ol start="1">
<li>
A substructure search is performed to match the <i>query</i> (left-hand side)
of each transformation rule to the input ligand(s).  Every match that results
is processed in turn.
<p>
<li>
The matched atoms are replaced by those of the <i>result</i> (right-hand side).
The details of individual transformation rules indicate whether query atoms
or bonds are copied rather than replaced.
<p>
<li>
The remaining ligand atoms (unspecified in the transformation) are
reconnected appropriately.  Transformations that result in disconnected
heavy-atoms are discarded.  Duplicates are removed once 3D coordinates
have been generated (below).
</ol>
The following example demonstrates this process:

<p align="center">
<img src="shaman/transsample1.png"
alt="MedChem Transformations Sample Transformation" /></p>

The reaction numbers, 1-8, indicate which atoms of the query correspond to
those of the result.  As all atoms on the left-hand side are numbered, no
atoms will be deleted.  The query contains a wildcard (<b>A</b>, meaning any
heavy atom), and one of the carbons (<b>C(s2)</b>) must be connected to only
two heavy-atom neighbors.  When the substructure search is performed, the
methyl substituent on the central ring blocks one of the four possible
mappings.  The valid matches for this carbon are indicated by <b>A</b>,
<b>B</b> and <b>C</b>, and the resulting structures are given below:

<p align="center">
<img src="shaman/rxnprod1.png"
alt="MedChem Transformations Sample Results" /></p>

As you can see, the atoms and bonds that are not specified in the
transformation are copied to the resulting structure.  If multiple
iterations were being performed, the new structures would be part of
the input for the next iteration.

<h3>Generate Coordinates</h3>
<p>
Applying a transformation rule to a ligand updates the connectivity but
generally results in poor geometries.  This is particularly true
if larger numbers of atoms are involved or atom insertion/deletion occurs.
MedChem Transformations
generates 3D coordinates for output molecules in two ways, <i>minimization or
3D embedding</i>, based on the number of atoms involved.  Partial charges
are ignored for these calculations, as MedChem Transformations assumes
that final geometries will be created during the <b>Refine + Score</b> step.
Ligand atoms not involved in the transformation, and the receptor (if
present) are considered <i>invariant atoms</i>.
<p>
The first method is used when the heavy atom count changed by at most
one atom:
<ol start="1">
<li>
If a heavy-atom was added or deleted, a short minimization using an elevated
gradient cutoff is performed.  The receptor is ignored and the
invariant atoms are fixed for this calculation.  Structures containing stereo
centers with incorrect geometry are discarded.
<p>
<li>
A second minimization is performed, with the receptor (if present) fixed
and the invariant atoms tethered.  If the heavy-atom count is unchanged,
the stereo center check is performed and improper structures discarded.
<p>
<li>
Structures with bond lengths or angles that fall outside the normal range
are discarded.
</ol>

<p>
For more complex transformations, a multi-step 3D embedding process similar
to <a href="../apps/confgui.htm#Methodology">Conformation Import</a> is used:
<ol start="1">
<li>
Construct the upper and lower distance bounds matrices (<b>U</b>, <b>L</b>),
where the interatomic distance, <b>D<sub>ij</sub></b>, must satisfy
<span class="nobr">
<b>L<sub>ij</sub></b> &le; <b>D<sub>ij</sub></b> &le; <b>U<sub>ij</sub></b>.
</span>
The upper and lower distance bounds for invariant atom pairs are set to their
interatomic distance, and the following table provides the distance bounds
(in Angstroms) used for transformed ligand atoms:

<p>
<center>
<table class="titlebar" style="font-size: 85%">
<tr>
<th>Pair Relationship</th>
<th>Lower Bound</th>
<th>Upper Bound</th>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle">
Bond (<b>d<sub>12</sub></b>)
<td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle">1.5
<td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle">1.5
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle">
Angle (<b>d<sub>13</sub></b>)
<td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle">2.5
<td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle">2.5
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle">
Dihedral (<b>d<sub>14</sub></b>)
<td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle">2.8
<td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle">3.9
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle">Non-bond
<td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle">2.5
<td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle">20.0
</table>
</center>

<br />
The lower distance bounds for transformed atom/receptor pairs is set to
3.0 &Aring;, a typical distance for ligand/receptor contact.
<p>
<li>
Calculate a random interatomic distance matrix, <b>D</b>, such that
<span class="nobr">
<b>D<sub>ij</sub></b> = <b>D<sub>ji</sub></b> = <b>L<sub>ij</sub></b> +
<b>X<sub>ij</sub></b>,
</span>
where <b>X<sub>ij</sub></b> is a random number chosen uniformly in the
interval [0,&nbsp;<b>U<sub>ij</sub></b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<b>L<sub>ij</sub></b>].
<p>
<li>
Generate an initial set of coordinates using least-squares linear embedding,
yielding two solutions differing by sign.  If a receptor is present, there
are sufficient invariant atoms to easily discard one of the solutions,
as it fails to superimpose these atoms.
<p>
<li>
Perform a short minimization using an elevated gradient cutoff.  The
receptor is ignored and the invariant atoms are fixed for this calculation.
Structures containing stereo centers with incorrect geometry are discarded.
<p>
<li>
Perform a second minimization, with the receptor (if present) fixed and
the invariant atoms tethered.  Structures with bond lengths or angles that
fall outside normal ranges are discarded.
<p>
<li>Repeat steps (2-5) to obtain a number of ligand conformations, taking the
lowest-energy alternative as the 3D structure.
</ol>

<p>
As this process is stochastic, multiple distinct poses tend to be created.
This, coupled with duplicate checking that preserves the lowest-energy
structure, provides partial coverage of the ligand's conformational space.
Hydrogen counts and partial charges are set for each generated structure.
<p>
If a receptor is present, the protein/ligand soft clash energy is calculated,
summing the repulsive contribution for each atom pair using an 800R3 potential:

<p align="center">
<img src="scaffold/math_800R3potential.png" alt="Soft Clash Potential" /></p>

where &Epsilon;<sub><i>i</i></sub> and &Epsilon<sub><i>j</i></sub> are
the van der Waals well-depths (in kcal/mol), <i>r<sub>ij</sub></i> is the
interatomic distance and
R<sub><i>i</i></sub> and R<sub><i>j</i></sub> are the van der Waals radii.
The parameters are modified OPLS-AA van der Waals parameters tuned to
reproduce the free energy of solvation of a collection of small molecules.
If the lowest-energy alternative fails the clash test, it is discarded.

<h3>Filters</h3>
<p>
Constructed molecules can be filtered in three ways.  First, a
<a href="../quasar/fcnref/descrfcn.htm#DescriptorExprSyntax">
Descriptor Filter</a> can be specified, and the calculated MOE
<a href="../quasar/descr.htm">Descriptors</a>
must satisfy the range/boolean values specified.  Second, a
<a href="../quasar/modcomp.htm#Composer">Model file</a> can be provided,
and each new molecule must satisfy the specified criterion.  Finally,
a pharmacophore query can be provided, which the absolute positions of each
new molecule must satisfy.  Structures failing any of these
filters are discarded, and all properties calculated during filtering are
written to the output database.

<h3>Synthetic Score</h3>
<p>
A <a href="../moe/fcnref/rsynthfcn.htm">Synthetic Feasibility Score</a> is
calculated for every new molecule that has passed the specified filters.
This is a score in the range of 0 to 1 with 1 meaning fully synthesizable
and 0 meaning not feasible.  MedChem Transformations can optionally
discard structures resulting from transformations that lower the feasibility
score.  This can also be used as a term in the
Descriptor Filter via the <tt>rsynth</tt> descriptor.

<h3>Refine + Score</h3>
<p>
If a receptor is present,
<a href="docking.htm#Refinement">Forcefield Refinement</a> can be used to
relax each new molecule in the pocket.  Sidechains can be treated flexibly
(with or without a tether), but backbone atoms are always held fixed.
This generates an energy score using the
<a href="../moe/pot.htm#Equation">Generalized Born solvation model (GB/VI)</a>
[Labute&nbsp;2008].  This value, along with the protein coordinates if the
sidechains were not fixed, is written to the output database.
Molecules can be scored using one of the methods in MOE's
<a href="docking.htm#Scoring">Docking</a> application.

If the
<tt>London&nbsp;dG</tt> score is calculated, the ligand efficiency (estimated
pKi divided by the number of heavy atoms) is also written to the output
database.

<p>
If no Receptor is present, tethered minimization (using the current forcefield)
can be used to generate relaxed structures with as little global change
in ligand alignment or orientation as possible.  All atoms not involved
with the specific transformation are considered invariant, with a force
constant applied to each heavy atom to maintain its position.  The transformed
atoms are unconstrained, allowing the new portion of each molecule to
relax relatively freely while preserving overall geometry.

<p>
If a pharmacophore query filter is used, minimization or refinement will
use forcefield restraints between the features in the query and the
pharmacophore annotations in the molecule.  Such restraints will only be
applied if the pharmacophore query uses the
<a href="ph4_annot.htm">Unified Annotation Scheme</a>.

<!-- =================== Creating Transformations ======================= !-->

<p>
<a name="CreateTrans"></a>
<h2>Creating Transformations</h2>

<p>
Transformations are drawn as reactions using SymyxDraw, IsisDraw, 
ChemDraw or other sketchers and saved using standard file formats such as
RXN [Symyx&nbsp;2007].  Using a 2D sketch rather than line notation such
as SMIRKS
[Daylight&nbsp;2008] makes it easier to specify and visualize
transformations.  Users can easily add or modify the rules to reflect
their specific chemistry.  Transformations must be
drawn in the style <b>Query&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;Result</b> and SymyxDraw
can be used to encode the piperidine transformation shown above:

<p align="center">
<img src="shaman/rxnpix1.png"
alt="MedChem Transformations Reaction Definition" /></p>

The <i>query</i> (left-hand side) defines the specific functionality to be
transformed and the <i>result</i> (right-hand side) defines its replacement.
The reaction (atom-pair) numbering explicitly defines the relationship
between left- and right-hand atoms.  Unnumbered atoms in the
query are used during substructure search but otherwise discarded, while
unnumbered atoms in the result are added to the transformed structure.
Atoms and bonds not referenced in the reaction are preserved.
<p>
This reaction provides examples of both left- and right-hand side wildcards.
For the query, <b>A</b> means any non-hydrogen atom and <b>C(s2)</b>
means a carbon atom connected to exactly two heavy-atom neighbors.  As this
carbon is deleted by the reaction, having additional heavy-atom neighbors would
result in a disconnected structure.  For the result, <b>A</b> means that
the matching query atom is copied from the left- to the right-hand side.
Thus, the carbon atoms (reaction numbers 4, 5) and whatever atoms matched
the query wildcards (reaction numbers 1-3) are copied to the resulting
structure, preserving any connectivity that might be present.
<p>
The individual transformations, represented as individual files, can be
collected into a single directory, or saved in a MOE database.  The default
rules used by the MedChem Transformations application are provided in
<span class="nobr"> <tt>$MOE/lib/medchem_rxn.mdb</tt></span>.
Browsing this database will reveal each rule in turn, such as the
transformation used in this example:

<p align="center">
<img src="shaman/rxnbrowse.png"
alt="MedChem Transformations Reaction Browser" /></p>

<p>
There are several considerations when constructing or extending a
transformation rule set:
<ul>
<li>
The set must be consistent, and an aromatization and formal charge
policy must be set.  MedChem Transformations' rules assume that 5-membered
heteroaromatic rings are drawn in Kekule notation while 6-membered rings
are drawn in either Kekule or aromatic notation.  They also assume that
any change in atomic formal charge is explicitly defined for the
transformation.
<p>
<li>
A balance must be maintained between diversity and drug-likeness.  Halogenation
or unusual functional group transformations must be used sparingly, so as to
avoid creating non-synthesizable or otherwise undesirable structures.
MedChem Transformations' rules tend to be conservative, preferring to
exchange rather than add functionality.
<p>
<li>
The rule set has a critical impact on performance, particularly if multiple
iterations are used.  A smaller number of generalized rules is preferred
over a large number of specific transformations, particularly if the latter
leads to duplicate structures that must be generated and discarded.
To simplify rule creation, MedChem Transformations includes an option (enabled
by default) to exchange neutral N-, O- and S-atoms connected by single bonds to
exactly two heavy-atom neighbors.  This, for example, eliminates the need to
duplicate rules involving pyrrole, furan, and thiophene.
</ul>

<p>
Transformations applied to selected ligand subsets can yield unexpected
results.  In the example below, the saturated 6-membered ring is selected
(left side).  As the spiro atom is selected, transformations can be applied
which can change the 5-membered ring:

<p align="center"><img src="shaman/OddResult.png" alt="Unexpected Result"></p>

As indicated, the 5-membered ring was transformed into a 6-membered via
insertion of the indicated methylene.  This, and the originally-selected
6-membered ring are now candidates for additional transformations
if multiple iterations are desired.  Note that all unselected ligand atoms
are maintained with this transformation.

</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Maintaining Reaction Databases</h3>

<p>
Reaction rules sets can be represented in two ways: a collection of files
in a directory or as entries in a database.  The latter format is more
flexible, in that it can be annotated and rules subsets can be used when
running MedChem Transformations.  Utility functions, described below,
have been provided to convert between formats.

<h4>Database to Directory</h4>

<p>
A reaction database can be converted to a directory via the following
command entered at the <span class="nobr"><b>SVL Commands</b></span>
prompt:

<p>
<tt>run ['$MOE/lib/svl/run/medchemtrns.svl',
[database, directory, opt], '_MedChemTrns_MakeDir']</tt>
</p>

where <i>database</i> is the name of an existing reaction database and
<i>directory</i> is the name of the output directory.  If the directory
does not exist, it will be created.  If the directory exist, reactions with
unique filenames will be added.  If the user specifies the option
<span class="nobr"><tt>overwrite:1</tt></span>, all reactions from the
input database will be written out.  All annotations will be discarded.

<h4>Directory to Database</h4>

<p>
A directory can be converted to a reaction database via the following
command entered at the <span class="nobr"><b>SVL Commands</b></span>
prompt:

<p>
<tt>run ['$MOE/lib/svl/run/medchemtrns.svl',
[directory, database, opt], '_MedChemTrns_MakeMDB']</tt>
</p>

where <i>directory</i> is the name of an existing directory and
<i>database</i> is the name of the output database.  If the database does
not exist, it will be created.  If the database exists, reactions with
unique filenames will be added.  If the user specifies the option
<span class="nobr"><tt>overwrite:1</tt></span>, all entries and fields in
the output database will be cleared and all reactions from the input
directory will be written out.

If Descriptor or Model filtering is used, additional columns are created
in the output database to receive the various calculated properties.  This
database can be analyzed using any of the other analysis tools in MOE.

<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>
In this section we will present a number of example calculation using the
MedChem Transformations application, using the PDB structure 1IOE.

<div class="example">

<h3>Prepare Input</h3>
<p>
<ol start="1">
<li><i>Prepare the protein/ligand pair.</i><br />
First clear the system:
<p class="indent_novspace">
<span class="menu">MOE | File | Close</span></p><br />
Open the PDB file:
<p class="indent_novspace">
<span class="menu">MOE | File | Open</span></p>
In the Open panel, select
<span class="nobr"><tt>$MOE/sample/mol/1ioe.pdb</tt></span>.<br /><br />
Set the optimal protonation state:
<p class="indent_novspace">
<span class="menu">MOE | Compute | Protonate 3D</span></p>
Take the default options and press <b>OK</b>.  This will take a minute or
so to complete.<br /><br />
Hide the Receptor and hydrogen atoms:
<p class="indent_novspace">
<span class="menu">MOE | Render | Hide | Receptor</span></p>
<p class="indent_novspace">
<span class="menu">MOE | Render | Hide Hydrogens</span></p><br />
Save it to disk:
<p class="indent_novspace">
<span class="menu">MOE | File | Save</span></p>
In the Save panel, enter
<span class="nobr"><tt>MCTtest.moe</tt></span>.  This can be used
when rerunning the sample calculations.
<p>
<li><i>Start MedChem Transformations.</i>
<p class="indent_novspace">
<span class="menu">MOE | Compute | Fragments | MedChem Transformations...
</span></p>
Ensure that the Receptor set is set to Receptor Atoms and the Ligand set is
set to Ligand Atoms.  Toggle on
<span class="nobr"><b>Open Database Viewer</b></span> and
<span class="nobr"><b>Minimize Structures</b></span>  to refine each
output structure in the pocket.
</ol>
</div>

<div class="example">

<h3>Single Iteration</h3>

<i>Decrease the filtering.</i><br />
Change the <b>Descriptor Filter</b> to <tt>Weight<560</tt>
<tt>Slogp[-4,8]</tt> <tt>TPSA[40,140]</tt>.  This increases the maximum
molecule weight that will be accepted.
<p>
Press <b>Search</b> to start the MedChem Transformations calculation.  This
takes a few minutes, and the progress is reported at the bottom of the GUI.
The output molecules have molecular weights less than 560, logP's in the
range of -4 to 8 and TPSA in the range of 40 to 140.  The
<span class="nobr"><b>SVL Commands</b></span> window provides information
about the calculation.

</div>

<div class="example">

<h3>Two Iteration/Subset</h3>

<ol start="1">
<li>
<div class="floatright">
<img src="shaman/shaman_selected.png"
alt="Two Iteration/Subset Atom Selection" />
</div>

<i>Decrease the filtering.</i><br />
Change the <b>Descriptor Filter</b> to <tt>Weight<560</tt>
<tt>Slogp[-4,8]</tt> <tt>TPSA[40,140]</tt>.  This increases the maximum
molecule weight that will be accepted.
<p>
<li>
<i>Set up the calculation.</i><br />
Select the atoms of the pyridine ring (shown at right).  This limits
transformations to these atoms, their associated hydrogens and all atoms
added by transformation.  Change <b>Iterations</b> from 1 to 2.
</ol>

<p>
Press <b>Search</b> to start the MedChem Transformations calculation.  This
takes a few minutes, and the progress is reported at the bottom of the GUI.
The <span class="nobr"><b>SVL Commands</b></span> window provides information
about the calculation.

<div class="floatright">
<img src="shaman/shaman_results.png" alt="Two Iteration/Subset Results" />
</div>

<p>
You can examine the output, <tt>medchem.mdb</tt> in the Database Viewer.
There are roughly fifteen structures, four of which reflect a single
transformation while the rest resulted from two transformations.
The output molecules have molecular weights less than 560, logP's in the
range of -4 to 8 and TPSA in the range of 40 to 140.  Because filtering
was used, entries for <b>Weight</b>, <b>SlogP</b> and <b>TPSA</b> were
included in the output database.

<p>
You can expand the <b>rule</b> column to see the rule(s) used to create the
structures.  As you can see, <b>Rrmsd</b> is quite small for these
structures and the results superimpose well on the starting ligand.
This is shown to the right, with the input structure in green.

<p>
All of the transformations involved the selected atoms or those added in
the first iteration.  Looking at the <b>mseq</b> column, you can see
gaps in the sequence numbers.  This results from duplicate structures
appearing in the second iteration having lower protein/ligand energies
than those of the first iteration.
