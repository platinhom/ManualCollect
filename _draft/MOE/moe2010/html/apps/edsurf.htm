<h2>Electron Density Surface</h2>

<p>An electron density surface is a representation of the electron-density
distribution in a unit cell, sampled over a grid.  To visualize the electron
density surface, either isosurfaces or cutplanes can be used.  MOE calculates
the electron density surface from reflection data stored in the MTZ (CCP4)
file format.  Both structure factor amplitude and phase data must be
present in the file.

<i>Electron Density Isosurface of Sperm Whale Myoglobin</i>
</center>

<p>Electron density is calculated from the expression:

<p><center><img src="edsurf/edens.png"></center>

<p>where

<p>
<table align="center" border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="2">

<tr>
<td>
&rho;
<td>
electron density

<tr>
<td><i>xyz</i>
<td>the <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i> fractional coordinates in the unit cell

<tr>
<td><i>F</i>
<td>structure factor, having magnitude and phase

<tr>
<td><i>hkl</i>
<td>the <i>h</i>, <i>k</i>, <i>l</i> indices of reflection

<tr>
<td><i>V</i>
<td>volume of the unit cell

</table>
</p>

<p>From this expression, it is seen that the electron density is
the inverse Fourier transform of the structure factor.  In MOE,
Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) techniques are used to perform the
calculation.

<a name="CreatingSurface"></a>
<h2>Creating an Electron Density Surface</h2>

<p>To open the Electron Density Surface panel, use
<b><nobr>MOE | File | Open</nobr></b> to open an MTZ file.  The following
panel appears:

<p align="center">
<img src="edsurf/panel.png" alt="Electron Density Surface Panel">

<p>You can also invoke the panel by entering

<pre>
    run 'edsurf.svl'
</pre>

<p>which will prompt you for the name of the MTZ file to read.

<p>At the top of the panel, the name of the source file containing the
reflection data is displayed in the <b>File</b> text field.  The <b>Map</b>
pulldown menu allows you to select from the maps that have been
calculated, if any.  Map names are constructed from the parameters
used in the map calculations. For example, <tt>F,PHIC</tt> would
be the name of a map computed using the columns <tt>F</tt> and
<tt>PHIC</tt>.  These map names are used to prefix the graphic objects
(isosurface, cutplanes, unit cell box, etc.) that are created
for visualizing the density field, and appear in
the <a href="../moe/gui/gobjman.htm">Graphics Object
Manager</a>, which can be used to hide or delete the surfaces, or
to change their material and transparency properties.
Maps can be deleted using the <b>Delete</b> button next to
the <b>Map</b> pulldown menu.  Deleting a map will delete all
associated graphic objects (isosurface, cutplanes, etc.).

<p>The remainder of the panel is occupied by a pager.  The <b>File
Information</b> page contains crystallographic information gleaned from the
source file, as well as information about the electron density surface.  
Here, you can specify which columns to use, and whether a difference
map is to be calculated.

<p>The <b>Isosurface</b> and <b>Cutplanes</b> pages are dedicated to
controls for rendering the surface using either an isosurface or cutplanes,
respectively.

<p>Before an electron density surface can be rendered, it must be
calculated. Select the columns to be used and press <b>Calculate Map</b>
to do the calculation.  The <b>Map</b> pulldown menu will be updated
to reflect the newly computed map.  Several maps can be held in
memory concurrently, and you can switch between them simply by
making a selection in this menu.

Once the calculation is complete, use the <b>Isosurface</b> and
<b>Cutplanes</b> pages to generate graphical renderings of the map.
Subsequent changes made to the isosurface and cutplane parameters do not
require recalculation of the electron density map.  Most changes are
made automatically.  Pressing <b>Apply</b> will ensure any changes are put
into effect.

<p>The electron density surface calculation may take a few moments to
complete.  Progress information is displayed in both the MOE Window and
the SVL Commands Window.

<a name="FileInfo"></a>
<h3>Crystallographic and Surface Information</h3>

<p>The <b>File Info</b> page displays space group and unit cell information, as
well as the size and range of values of the calculated electron density
surface.  The size and minimum and maximum values of the map (<b>Grid Size</b>,
<b>Min</b>, and <b>Max</b>) are displayed only after the electron density
surface has been calculated, i.e. after <b>Calculate Map</b> has been
pressed.

<p>Difference map calculation is achieved by turning on
<b>Difference Map</b> and selecting the kind of map to
compute, as well as a second F column, then pressing
<b>Calculate Map</b>.

<p align="center">
<img src="edsurf/fileinfo.png" alt="File Information Page">

<p>The data columns to be used as the structure factor magnitude and phase
data in the electron density calculation are specified using the following
options:

<p><table width="100%" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5">

<h3>Specifying an Electron Density Isosurface</h3>

<p>When rendering an electron density surface using an isosurface, the extent,
contour level, color, and rendering mode can all be specified.

<p align="center">
<img src="edsurf/iso_panel.png" alt="Isosurface Page">

<p>The electron density isosurface can be drawn throughout a single unit
cell or can be restricted to a box and/or to a subset of atoms of the
asymmetric unit and its crystallographic symmetry images within the unit
cell or its immediate neighboring cells.

<p>The restricting atoms are specified by turning on the <b>Near</b>
checkbox.  You can choose from any of the currently recognized named atom
collections in the system, e.g. Ligand, Receptor, All Atoms, Selected
Atoms, etc.

<p>In all cases, the following can be set:

<p>
<ul>

<li><b>Within</b>.  The value here defines the
<i>proximity to the restricting set of atoms</i>.  The surface is
rendered only within the specified distance of the set of restricting atoms.

<li><b>Visible</b>.  If on, only visible atoms of the
restricting set will be used.

</ul>

<p>The isosurface can be further restricted to a box by turning on
<b>Restrict to Box</b>.  The box position and size can be controlled using
the <b>Position</b> trackball and <b>Box Size</b> sliders, and its display
can be turned on and off using the <b>Show Restricting Box</b> toggle.
Box size is specified as fractions of the unit cell.  The trackball operates
as follows:

<p>
<ul>

<li><b>Translation in X-Y</b>.  <tt>&lt;Shift&gt;</tt>-left drag.
The movement will be in viewing coordinates (i.e. moving the mouse right
will result in movement to the right).

<li><b>Translation in Z</b>.  <tt>&lt;Ctrl&gt;</tt>-left drag.
The movement will be in viewing coordinates, moving the box towards
or away from the viewer.

</ul>

<p>Choosing a lower density for rendering the isosurface when using the
restricting box will result in smoother, more responsive motion of the
restricted isosurface.
</p>

<center>
<img src="edsurf/nearatoms.png"
alt="Isosurface Restricted to Nearby Atoms">

<br>
<i>Isosurface restricted to atoms of selected residues.<br>
Coloring is by atom element.</i>
</center>

<p>The controls to change the rendering style of the
isosurface are:

<table width=100% cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5>

<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Render</b>
<td valign="top">

The isosurface can be rendered in one of three modes: as a dot
surface (<b>Dot</b>), a mesh surface (<b>Line</b>), or a shaded surface
(<b>Solid</b>).  Selecting <b>None</b> will prevent
the isosurface from being calculated.  This is useful for saving time when
the isosurface is not needed.

<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Level</b>
<td valign="top">

The contour level of the isosurface is specified using the <b>Level</b>
slider.  The level is given in units of sigma (standard deviation of the
density).  The slider value can alternatively be controlled by entering
a value in the text field and pressing <tt>Enter</tt>.


<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Color</b>
<td valign="top">The colors used for coloring the surface can be set
using one of the following schemes:

    <p><table border=1 cellspacing=2 cellpadding=2>

    <tr>
    <td valign="top"><b>Grid</b>
    <td>Color taken from the map colormap, where low values are mapped to
    blue, high to red.

    <tr>
    <td valign="top"><b>Gradient</b>
    <td>Gradient of the electron density distribution.

    <tr>
    <td valign="top"><b>Atom</b>
    <td>Color by the atom color of the nearest atom; dark gray if no
    atoms nearby.

    <tr>
    <td valign="top"><b>Residue</b>
    <td>Color by the residue color of the nearest atom's residue; dark
    gray if no atoms nearby.

    <tr>
    <td valign="top"><b>Chain</b>
    <td>Color by the chain color of the nearest atom's chain; dark gray if no
    atoms nearby.

    <tr>
    <td valign="top"><b>Atom Scalar</b>
    <td>Color by the atom scalar value of the nearest atom, where low
    values are mapped to red, high to blue; dark gray if no atoms nearby.

    <tr>
    <td valign="top"><b>Custom Scalar</b>
    <td valign="top">User-selected color from the color widget.

    </table>

<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>T</b>
<td valign="top">

5 levels of surface transparency are provided.
<b>0</b> gives an opaque surface (fastest drawing mode).
Transparency can also be controlled from the
<a href="../moe/gui/gobjman.htm">Graphics Object
Manager</a>, which also has controls for setting
material properties.

<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Density</b>
<td valign="top">

Specifies the relative density of the isosurface sample points
with respect to the average density of the grid points.
The isosurface can be rendered
more coarsely by choosing a lower rendering resolution,
resulting in faster drawing.

</table>

<a name="SpecifyingCutplane"></a>
<h3>Specifying an Electron Density Cutplane</h3>

<p>An electron density surface can be visualized using cutplanes.  A cutplane
is created by pressing <b>New</b>.  To switch between existing cutplanes,
use the pulldown menu.  All cutplanes can be rendered simultaneously.
Cutplanes can also be deleted.

<p>
<center>
<img src="edsurf/cut_panel.png" alt="Cutplane Page">
</center>

<p>When a cutplane is first created, it is oriented perpendicular to the
<i>a</i>-axis of the unit cell.  Subsequently, the cutplane can be translated
and rotated.  It can also be "snapped", by pressing one of the <b>Snap</b>
buttons, to one of the major axes of the unit cell, or to the current set of
selected (<b>sel</b>), visible (<b>vis</b>), or restricting (<b>near</b>)
atoms.  The center of rotation and normal to the plane are indicated by
a small green ball and a green arrow, respectively, whose display can be
turned on and off using the <b>Show Cutplane Center and Normal</b> toggle.

<p>The rendering parameters for each cutplane are set independently:

<table width="100%" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5">

<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Render</b>
<td valign="top">
Each cutplane can be rendered independently of the others as either
dots, lines, or a solid sheet.  To turn off the rendering of the
chosen cutplane, select <b>None</b>.

<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>T</b>
<td valign="top">

5 levels of cutplane transparency are provided. <b>0</b> gives an opaque
surface (fastest drawing mode).  Transparency can also be controlled from the
<a href="../moe/gui/gobjman.htm">Graphics Object Manager</a>, which also has
controls for setting material properties.  The <b>Color Scale</b> can also be
used to set cutplane transparency.

<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Density</b>
<td valign="top">
Specifies the relative density of the cutplane sample points
with respect to the average density of the grid points.
The cutplane can be rendered
more coarsely by choosing a lower rendering resolution.


<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Color Scale</b>
<td valign="top">

Cutplane colormap.  The three colors are used to color to low, medium,
and high density areas, respectively.  The density values are specified
in units of sigma (standard deviation of the density).  Density values
equal to or lower than the lower bound are colored by the corresponding
color (default blue).  Similarly, values equal to or higher than the
upper bound are colored by the corresponding color (default red).
For intermediate density values, color interpolation is performed.

<p>Each color has a separate transparency channel, accessible through
the pulldown area of the color widget.  A transparency value of 0
or less produces an opaque surface.  Higher values provide more
transparency.  This can be useful, for instance, for making areas
of low density transparent, while leaving the high-density areas
opaque.

<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Position</b>
<td valign="top">
The position of the center of the cutplane.
The trackball operates as follows:

<p>
<ul>

<li><b>Rotation</b>.  Left drag.

<li><b>Translation in X-Y</b>.  <tt>&lt;Shift&gt;</tt>-left drag.
The movement will be in viewing coordinates (i.e. moving the mouse right
will result in movement to the right).

<li><b>Translation in Z</b>.  <tt>&lt;Ctrl&gt;</tt>-left drag.
The movement will be in viewing coordinates, moving the box towards
or away from the viewer.

</ul>

<p>The wheel is used to translate the plane in the direction of
its normal.

</table>

<p>Like isosurfaces, cutplanes can be restricted to named atom
sets.  Turn on <b>Near</b> to access the list of currently available
restricting atom sets.  The <b>Within</b> field dictates how
large a patch is drawn around the atoms.  When <b>Visible</b> 
is on, only visible atoms of the restricting set are
used.
