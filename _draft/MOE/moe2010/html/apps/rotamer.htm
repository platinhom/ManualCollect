<a name="Mutations"></a><h2>Mutation Overview</h2>

<p>
The purpose of the Rotamer Explorer is to explore the conformational
space of amino acid sidechains within proteins in the presence of
surrounding amino acids, ligands, and solvent.
You can visually inspect potential sidechain conformations and
rank by multiple scores.
Additionally the Rotamer Explorer can be used to mutate the selected
sidechain (and explore rotamers of these mutations).

<p>
A second method to mutate amino acids is the <b>Mutate Prompt.</b>
To use the Mutate Prompt in the Sequence Editor,
choose <span class="nobr"><b>SE | Edit | Protein | Mutate</b></span>.
The command line of the Sequence Editor will be changed to the Mutate Prompt.
</p>

<p><center><img src="rotamer/mutate.png" alt="Mutate Prompt" /></center></p>

<p>
Selecting a residue with the cursor mutates it into
the new residue as specified in the option menu of the prompt.
Residues which are not amino acids cannot be mutated.
While the Mutate Prompt is faster to use,
the Rotamer Explorer provides more functionality.
</p>

<p>
Note that proteins with sequence-only data (i.e. without
explicitly defined atoms) can only be mutated with the Mutate prompt.
</p>

<a name="Methodology"></a><h2>Rotamer Explorer Methodology</h2>

<a name="Generation"></a><h3>Conformation Generation</h3>
A rich discrete all atom rotamer (or conformation) library is used by the
Rotamer Explorer for both sidechain conformation exploration and residue
mutation. The sidechain coordinates are optimally rotated and translated
onto a particular backbone of a particular protein structure. (Previous
versions of the Rotamer Explorer used a systematic conformational search
that varied dihedral angles but used ideal bond lengths and angles.)

<p>
Historically, rotamer libraries were conformations of protein sidechains
created using ideal bond lengths and angles but with dihedral angles
derived from observations in the PDB. For example Lovell's
Penultimate Rotamer Library (PRL) [Lovell&nbsp;2003] contains 152 rotamers
with 34 rotamers for Arg, 27 for Lys, 13 for Met, 9 for Gln, 8 for Glu.
These rotamer libraries are intended for crystallographic refinement
applications. The reason for having so few rotamers, even for the
flexible sidechains, is that no uncommon rotamers should be introduced
into the crystallographic structures.
It is intended that further refinement will be conducted,
so that the sidechain can adapt to a folded protein environment.
The Dunbrack rotamer library [Dunbrack&nbsp;1993,2002] contains roughly 350
rotamers along with statistical (&psi;,&phi;) dependent preferences
&mdash; a kind of pseudo strain energy &mdash; again assuming ideal
bond lengths and angles.  Typically &chi;<sub>1</sub> preferences are
well characterized, however &chi;<sub>2</sub>, &chi;<sub>3</sub>, etc.
preferences are poorly characterized, if at all. Given the small size
of these libraries it is not surprising that over 10% of residues in
high resolution crystal structures cannot be matched by the PRL or
Dunbrack rotamers.
For the exploration of the rotamer space, as intended in the Rotamer Explorer
application, a much larger rotamer library is desired.
In addition, the use of ideal bond lengths and angles in the rotamer libraries
mentioned above can result in self-clashing rotamers since variations from
ideal bond angles are required for certain combinations of dihedral
angles.
</p>

<p>
The Rotamer Library in MOE is a collection of all-atom sidechain conformations
derived from high quality x-ray crystal structures.  These conformations
differ markedly from the traditional rotamer libraries in that bond length
and angle variations are permitted.  The intent of the MOE rotamer library
is to provide adequate coverage of the conformational space available to
a sidechain and not just encode dihedral preferences.  The rotamers
are located in <tt>$MOE/lib/amino.mdb</tt> in a packed conformation
field associated with each sidechain.
A collection of ~2,000 high quality PDB structures was assembled; each
structure had a resolution &le; 1.5&nbsp;&Aring;, a Free R &le; 0.24,
an R Value &le; 0.2, and contained less than 30 atom overlaps per 1,000 atoms.
From each such structure all residues with 1.0 occupancy, no missing atoms,
B-factors &le; 30 for the backbone and &le; 40 for the sidechain and without
close contacts were identified.	 The coordinates of each such residue
were extracted and refined with the AMBER99 forcefield with strong
flat-bottomed tethers applied to all atoms (ACE and NME caps were used
as terminii).  The resulting AMBER99 bond angle, dihedral and van der Waals
energies were calculated and stored with the refined coordinates in a
database.  Duplicates were removed and the lowest energy conformation
amongst the duplicates was retained. Two conformations were considered
duplicate if the maximum corresponding interatomic distance was less
than 0.3&nbsp;&Aring;.	The resulting library contained ~35,500 conformations
with associated AMBER99 energies; Arg has more than 12,000 rotamers and
Glu/Gln have several thousand each, in marked contrast to historical
rotamer libraries.  Consequently, little or no coordinate refinement is required
(unlike the historical rotamer libraries) and bond angle variations
are explicitly taken into account.

<a name="Scoring"></a><h3>Scoring</h3>

The sidechain conformation score is a sum of three terms:
<ol>
<li>The sidechain strain energy from the rotamer library.
<li>The AMBER99 van der Waals interaction energy with the environment.
<li>A hydrogen bond score made up of a radial Lennard-Jones 12-10 potential
and a dipole-dipole electrostatic term.
</ol>

The hydrogen bond radial 12-10 distribution is consistent with
contact statistics derived from the PDB.

<p align="center"><img src="rotamer/penalty.png" alt="Penalty Term" /></p>
<!-- LATEX rotamer/penalty \[
    P = \exp\left[-\frac{1}{kT}\left(
    {5}\left[\frac{2.85}{r_{ij}}\right]^{12}
    -{6}\left[\frac{2.85}{r_{ij}}\right]^{10}
    \right)\right]

\] ENDLATEX -->

where <i>r<sub>ij</sub></i> is the distance between the polar heavy atoms in
the sidechain and the environment.

<p>
Each polar hydrogen bearing heavy atom is given a point dipole in a
direction consistent with its hybridization and with a magnitude consistent
with the TIP5P water model. Dipole-dipole electrostatic interactions are
evaluated for each such pair:
</p>

<p align="center"><img src="rotamer/dipole.png" alt="Dipole Energy Term" /></p>
<!-- LATEX rotamer/dipole \[

    E_{dip-dip} = \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_{0}}
    \left(\mathbf{d}_{i}\cdot \mathbf{d}_{j}
    -3 \left( \mathbf{d}_{i}\cdot \mathbf{r}_{ij} \right)
    \left( \mathbf{r}_{ij}\cdot \mathbf{d}_{j} \right)
    \right)

\] ENDLATEX -->

where <b>d</b><sub><i>i</i></sub> and <b>d</b><sub><i>j</i></sub>
are the dipole vectors of the
heavy atoms and <b>r</b><sub><i>ij</i></sub> the vector between the atom
positions.

<p>
The total hydrogen bond interaction energy E<sub>hb</sub>, which takes
directional effects into account, is the product of the radial term P
and the dipole-dipole energy term E<sub>dip-dip</sub>.

<p>
To open the Rotamer Explorer, do either of the following:

<ul>
<li>In the Sequence Editor, choose
<span class="nobr"><b>SE | Edit | Rotamer Explorer</b></span>.
<li>In the Sequence Editor, position the cursor over the residue of
interest and click the mouse popup button.  Choose <b>Rotamer Explorer</b>.
The Rotamer Explorer will open and immediately explore the specified
residue.  If the panel is already open, the residue will replace
any current data in the panel.
</ul>
