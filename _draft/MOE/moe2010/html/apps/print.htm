<p>The Print command is used to send the content of the MOE Window, Sequence
Editor, Database Viewer or SVL Text Editor to a printer.  The Print command can
be accessed using the File menu of the window to be printed. When invoked, a
Print Preview panel allows you to verify and, if required, modify the print
layout.</p>


<h2><a name="PrintImage">Print Preview Panel</a></h2>

<p>A Print Preview panel comprises three sections: the Preview Area, the
Printer Parameters section and the Content section.  The parameters available
in the Content section depend on which window is being printed.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">
<img src="print/pppanel.png" alt="Print Preview MOE">
</p>


<h3><a name="PreviewArea">Preview Area</a></h3>

<p> The Preview Area occupies the left side of the Print Preview panel.  There
is a rendering area where pages are displayed.  In the case of the MOE window,
the document will always comprise a single page. The contents of the Sequence
Editor, Database Viewer and SVL Text Editor may, however, span multiple pages.
Beneath the rendering area, the preview area footer holds the necessary
controls to browse the different pages of the document and zoom or translate
the currently displayed page.</p>

<p>
<center>
<table border="0" cellpadding="5">
<tr>
    <td align="center" valign="center">
	<img src="print/print_foot.png" align="left" alt="Preview Area Footer" />
    </td>
    <td align="center" valign="top">
	<table class="legend">
	<tr><th colspan="4">Button Legend</th>
	<tr>
	    <td> <img src="print/fpage.gif" alt="First Page Button" /></td>
	    <td> First Page</td>
	    <td> <img src="print/ppage.gif" alt="Previous Page Button" /></td>
	    <td> Previous Page</td>
	<tr>
	    <td> <img src="print/npage.gif" alt="Next Page Button" /></td>
	    <td> Next Page</td>
	    <td> <img src="print/lpage.gif" alt="Last Page Button" /></td>
	    <td> Last Page</td>
	<tr>
	    <td> <img src="print/reset.gif" alt="Reset View Button" /></td>
	    <td> Reset View</td>
	    <td colspan="2"> &nbsp;</td>
	</table>
</td>
</table>
</center>
</p>

<p> The <b>Previous Page</b> and <b>Next Page</b> buttons are used to cycle
through the pages of the document while the <b>First Page</b> and <b>Last
Page</b> button jump to the beginning and end of the document
respectively. Alternatively, type a page number in the textfield and press
<tt>Enter</tt> to go directly to that page. Note that the number of pages in
the document is displayed to the right of the textfield.</p>

<p>The magnification level of the page preview can be set using a
pulldown menu. 
The <b>X</b> and <b>Y</b> sliders are available to translate the page
along the corresponding axes so that all areas are accessible. The <b>Reset
View</b> button resets the magnification level to a 100% and centers the page in
the rendering area.</p>


<h3><a name="PrinterParam">Printer Parameters</a></h3>

<p>In the top right corner of the Print Preview panel is the Printer Parameters
section. In this section, a printing device can be selected and related
settings, for example paper format, margins and print range, specified.</p>


<div class="floatright">
<img src="print/printopt.png" alt="Printer Parameters" />
</div>

<p>The <b>Printer</b> pulldown menu contains a list of all the printing devices
found on the system. The available choices depend on the devices installed on
the computer. To print into a PostScript file, select the printer named
PostScriptFile in the menu. By default, a file named <tt>postscript.ps</tt>
will be created in MOE current working directory.  A different name can be
specified using the <b>Print to File</b> checkbox.</p>

<p>The <b>Print to File</b> checkbox allows you to specify whether to print to
a file or to send the data to a printing device.  If you turn the checkbox on,
the <b>File</b> textfield specifies the name of the file to write. You can
specify the name of the file by either typing it in or using the <b>Browse</b>
button which opens a file selection box.</p>

<p>The page size employed by the printing device is specified by selecting the
appropriate paper format in the <b>Page Size</b> pulldown menu.  The
<b>Landscape</b> checkbox controls the page orientation. By default,
<b>Landscape</b> is off and so portrait orientation is used. When turned on,
landscape orientation is used. The desired width of the page
margins are specified  with the <b>Left</b>, <b>Right</b>, <b>Top</b>,
and <b>Bottom</b> textfields. The unit of measure is either inches or
centimeters, depending on the state of the <b>Margins</b> button bank.</p>

<p>If you wish to print only a subset of the document, enter the range of pages
to print in the <b>Pages</b> textbox. When no pages are specified, the whole
document is printed. Otherwise, only the specified pages are printed. Multiple
pages can be separated by either <tt>,</tt> or <tt>;</tt>. For convenience, a
continuous sequence of pages is denoted by <tt>x-y</tt> where <tt>x</tt> is the
first page to print and <tt>y</tt> the last page to print. For example, to
print page 1,2,3,4,5 and 10 of a document, the following print range is used:
<tt>1-5; 10</tt>.</p>


<h3><a name="ContentParam">Content Parameters</a></h3>

<p>The Content Parameters section of the Print Preview panel occupies the
bottom right corner of the panel, underneath the Printer Parameters section.
The various options it contains are specific to the window being printed.</p>


<h2><a name="PrintMOE">Printing the MOE Window</a></h2>

<p>To print the content of the MOE Window, use the
<span class="menu">MOE | File | Print</span> menu command.
This will open the <b>MOE Window Print Preview</b> panel.</p>

<div class="floatright">
<img src="print/printMOE.png" alt="Print MOE Window" />
</div>

<p>The MOE Window Print Preview panel offers options for controlling the layout
of the page and for adding a header and footer to the page.</p>

<ul>

<li><b>Horizontal. Vertical.</b> These button banks specify the placement of
the drawing area on the page.  The buttons let you select the general alignment
of the image, <b>Left</b>, <b>Center</b>, or <b>Right</b> for horizontal,
<b>Top</b>, <b>Center</b>, or <b>Bottom</b> for vertical.
</li>

<li><b>Header. Footer.</b> These parameters are used to add a line of text to
the top and the bottom of the page respectively. Menus for <b>Font Type</b>,
<b>Font Style</b> and <b>Font Size</b> are available to customize the text
appearance. By default, the MOE window image is scaled to ensure that there is
no overlap with either the header or the footer. Turning on the
<b>Overlay Header</b> or <b>Overlay Footer</b> checkbox renders the text with
no consideration for the image placement, potentially superimposing the text
onto the image.
</li>

<li><b>Resolution.</b> This sets the print resolution of the image created 
from the scene in the MOE Window.
</li>

<li><b>Options.</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Anti-Alias</b>.  If on, the image will have high-quality anti-aliasing 
applied.  If off, the default amount of anti-alias specified in the 
<a href="../appendix/viewsetup.htm">Visualization Setup</a> panel will be applied.
</li>

<li><b>Transparent Background.</b> If off, the background is rendered; if on, 
the background is not rendered, i.e. it is set transparent.
</li>

</ul>
</li>

</ul>


<h2><a name="PrintTED">Printing the SVL Text Editor</a></h2>

<p>To print the content of an SVL Text Editor, use the
<span class="menu">TED | File | Print</span> menu command.
This will open the <b>SVL Text Editor Print Preview</b> panel.</p>

<p>The SVL Text Editor Print Preview panel provides controls to
manage text appearance and page numbering.</p>

<div class="floatright">
<img src="print/printTED.png" alt="Printing Text Editor" />
</div>


<ul>
<li><b>Font Type.</b> The Font Type pulldown menu is used to select the
font used to render characters. Please note that it is recommended to select
a fixed-width font like <tt>Teletype</tt> when printing SVL code 
in order to preserve indentation.
</li>

<li><b>Size.</b> Specifies the size of the text.
</li>

<li><b>Syntax Coloring.</b> If on, the text is colored according to
SVL syntax.  Color definitions are found in the MOE resource configuration file
(<tt>moe-rc</tt>) under the prefix <tt>editor.color.svl</tt>. Note that
using this setting with a device unable to display color may result in certain
colors being indistinguishable from each other. In this case, use the
<b>Bold Keywords</b> option instead.
</li>

<li><b>Bold Keywords.</b> If on, SVL keywords are rendered in bold.
This is useful for devices unable to display colors.
</li>

<li><b>Line Numbers.</b> If on, every line is prefixed with the line number.
</li>

<li><b>Numbering.</b> The Numbering pulldown menu is used to
activate page numbering and specify the position of the page number
on the page.
</li>
</ul>


<h2><a name="PrintSequence">Printing Sequence Data</a></h2>

<p>You can print the content of the Sequence Editor using the
<span class="menu">SE | File | Print </span> menu command. This opens
the <b>Sequence Editor Print Preview</b> panel, which allows you to format
the sequence data before sending it to a printing device.</p>

<p>The size of the text can be specified by typing a value in the
<b>Font Size</b> textfield, or by selecting
one of the predefined font sizes in the shortcut menu. If you wish page
numbers to be printed, turn on the <b>Page Numbers</b> checkbox.</p>


<div class="floatright">
<img src="print/printSEQ.png" alt="Printing Sequences" />
</div>


<p>The remaining options in the panel all concern sequence data display:</p>

<ul>

<li><b>Selected Chains Only.</b> If on, only the selected chains are considered
for printing.
</li>
<li><b>Secondary Structure.</b> If on, secondary structure assignments are
displayed as color-coded bars above the amino acid residues to which they apply.
</li>
<li><b>Predicted Secondary Structure.</b> If on, the predicted secondary
structure as calculated from the
<a href="../moe/gui/se.html#PredictSecondaryStructure">
<nobr>Homology | Predict Secondary Structure</nobr></a> command is displayed.
The secondary structure is shown as color-coded bars below the residues.
</li>
<li><b>Hydrogen Bonds.</b> If on, the protein backbone hydrogen bonds used by 
the DSSP secondary structure assignment algorithm to identify 3-turns,
4-turns and 5-turns are displayed. Bonds are drawn as arcs
connecting the donor and acceptor residues.
</li>
<li><b>Single Letter Residues.</b> If on, single-letter abbreviations of
amino and nucleic acids are used. Non-standard amino acids and nucleic acids are
displayed using an <tt>X</tt>.
Other residues, such as waters and moieties, are displayed as
empty boxes. In single-letter mode, dots are used to represent alignment
gaps.  For the complete list of residue abbreviations, see
<a href="../proteins/protool.htm#Codes">Building Proteins and DNA</a>.
</li>
<li><b>Color Residues.</b> If on, the residue colors
displayed in the Sequence Editor are used.
If you are not using a color printer, certain colors may be
indistinguishable from each other.  In this case, you may wish to adjust
the residue colors before printing.
</li>
<li><b>Residue Plots.</b> If on, scalar plots displayed in the Sequence
Editor are printed.
For the complete list of residue attributes that can be plotted, see
<a href="../moe/gui/se.html#Measuring">Measuring Stereochemistry</a>.
</li>
<li><b>Wrap Sequences.</b> If on, the sequences are wrapped such that the 
same sequence can appear many times on the same page.  If off, each 
sequence will only appear once on each page.
</li>
<li><b>Compound Name.</b> Controls display of the name and header of the chains, 
which can be printed in the selected position (either to the left or above each 
sequence).
</li>
<li><b>Numbering.</b> Controls residue numbering. If <b>Index</b>
is selected, ordinal numbering of the residues within the chains is used.
Selecting <b>UID</b> turns on display of the residue UID numbers.
</li>
</ul>


<h2><a name="PrintDatabase">Printing Databases</a></h2>

<div class="floatright">
<img src="print/printDBV.png" alt="Printing Databases" />
</div>

<p>You can print the content of a Database Viewer using the
<span class="menu">DBV | File | Print</span> menu command. This opens
the <b>Database Viewer Print Preview</b> panel.</p>

<p>You can print just a subset of a database by selecting the entries
and fields to print in the Database Viewer.
Turning on the <b>Use Selected Entries Only</b> or the
<b>Use Selected Fields Only</b> checkbox respectively restricts the
printable set to only the selected entries or the selected fields
of a database.</p>

<p><b>Page Header</b> and <b>Page Footer</b> are used to specify the text to be
displayed in the top and bottom margins of the page respectively.
Special markers can be used to control the text alignment:</p>

<p>
<center>
<table class="titlebar">
	<tr>
	<th>Tags</th>
	<th>Description</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td><tt>&lt;L&gt;</tt></td>
	<td>Any text following this tag is left-aligned.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td><tt>&lt;C&gt;</tt></td>
	<td>Any text following this tag is centered.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td><tt>&lt;R&gt;</tt></td>
	<td>Any text following this tag is right-aligned.</td>
	</tr>
</table>
</center>
</p>

<p>The <b>Page Header</b> and <b>Page Footer</b> also recognize the
following shortcut tags that are replaced at print time by their
actual values:</p>

<p>
<center>
<table class="titlebar">
	<tr>
	<th>Tags</th>
	<th>Description</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td><tt>&lt;PNUM&gt;</tt></td>
	<td>Current page number.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td><tt>&lt;TIME&gt;</tt></td>
	<td>Current time in HH:MM format.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td><tt>&lt;DATE&gt;</tt></td>
	<td>Current date in YYYY/MM/DD format.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td><tt>&lt;FNAME&gt;</tt></td>
	<td>Name of the source database.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td><tt>&lt;ASCTIME&gt;</tt></td>
	<td>26-characters English-language time/date stamp.</td>
	</tr>
</table>
</center>
</p>

<p>Font attributes and page layout are modified using the following controls:

<ul>

<p>
<li><b>Font.</b> Selects the font used to render characters. 
</li>

<p>
<li><b>Size.</b> Specifies the size of the text.
</li>

<p>
<li><b>Fit Width.</b> If on, ensure that no horizontal space goes unused on the
page by scaling field widths to fill the page.
</li>

<p>
<li><b>Fit Height.</b> If on, ensure that no vertical space goes unused on the
page by scaling entry heights to fill the page.
</li>

</ul>

<p>
<b>Mol Style</b> determines how molecular diagrams are drawn in the printed
document. Three drawing styles are possible:

<p>
<center>
<table class="titlebar">
<tr>
<th>Style</th>
<th>Description</th>
<tr>
<td>3D</td>
<td>Draw the molecule as seen in the database viewer.</td>
<tr>
<td>2D</td>
<td>Draw a 2D diagram of the molecule from the atom coordinates.</td>
<tr>
<td>Depicted</td>
<td>Rebuild atom coordinates in 2D using a flat layout algorithm.</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
</p>

<p>
If using a color printer, color can be added to the molecular diagram by
enabling the <b>Color Het Atoms</b> checkbox.</p>
<p> 
Tile mode is enabled by turning on the <b>Tile Molecule Field</b> checkbox.
In tile mode, the page is subdivided into tiles (boxes). The number of tiles
used is specified using the <b>Grid</b> textfield. Each tile
contains a molecular image at its center and six annotation locations
(one header, one footer and 4 legends) to present compound information
provided in the database. The pulldown menu beside the
<b>Tile Molecule Field</b> checkbox is used to select the database field
that contains the molecular structures to be used.</p>


<div class="floatright">
<img src="print/printtile.png" alt="Printing Databases Tiles" />
</div>


<p>
Enabling the <b>Display Entry Number</b> checkbox writes the molecule source
entry number in the top-left corner of its tile.</p>

<p>
<b>Header</b> and <b>Footer</b> are used to specify the data displayed 
above and below the molecule respectively. They can display the name of
the molecule, as stored in the molecule, or any fields present in the database,
as selected by the option menu to the right.</p>
<p>
<b>Legends</b> are displayed below the footer using a smaller font. They can
display data from any fields in the database and can be prefixed by their
source fieldname when the <b>Display Field Name</b> checkbox is enabled.</p>

<h2><a name="PrintGrob">Printing Graphical Objects</a></h2>

<div class="floatright">
<img src="print/printgrob.png" alt="Printing Graphical Objects" />
</div>


<p>You can print a grob with key <tt>key</tt> using the SVL command
<tt>gr_print key</tt>.  This opens the <b>Graphical Object Print Preview</b>
panel.</p>

<p><b>Title</b> and <b>Footnote</b> allow you to add text at the top and bottom
of the page, respectively.  The image will never overlap the text.  You may
select the <b>Font Type, Font Style</b> and <b>Font Size</b> for each from the
corresponding drop down menus, as well as the justification (<b>Left, Center</b>
or <b>Right</b>).  If your changes do not take effect immediately in the preview
window, click the <b>Apply</b> button to update it.</p>

<p><b>Scale</b> can be used to make the image larger or smaller.  Values larger
than 100% will be treated as 100% and values smaller than 10% will be treated 
as 10%.  The aspect ratio of the image is preserved.  Selecting
<b>Fit to Page</b> disables the <b>Scale</b> selector and expands the image to
fit the page both horizontally and vertically.  This may result in some
distortion of the image.  When <b>Fit to Page</b> is not selected, the
<b>Anchor</b> control can be used to position the image within the page,
justifying to one of the sides or corners of the page, or centering it.</p>

<p>The <b>Frame</b> option surrounds the graphics object with a thin black
border when selected.</p>

<br>
<h2><a name="GraphicExportPanel">Exporting Graphical Objects</a></h2>

<p>You can export a grob with key <tt>key</tt> to various graphics file formats
using the SVL command <tt>gr_export key</tt>.  This opens the <b>Export
Image</b> panel.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">
<img src="print/exportgrob.png" alt="Exporting Graphical Objects" />
</p>

<p>Enter the <b>Filename</b> you wish to export to, or use the <b>Browse...</b>
button if you want to find and select an existing file (which will be
overwritten).  Choose the graphics <b>Format</b> you wish to save as from the
drop-down list.  The filename extension will automatically be changed to match
the format you selected.  Each format has different format-specific options
associated with it, and will also change the <b>Color Space</b> available
(see below).  Transparency is available with certain formats as well 
(see <b>Background</b> below).  The two Clipboard formats (Windows only) export
directly to the Windows clipboard and thus the <b>Filename</b> is ignored in
these cases.</p>

<p>
<center>
<table class="titlebar">

</p>

<p>* Available only on Windows platforms.</p>

<p>Below the image preview are a number of options concerning the image that
will be exported.  You can specify the desired <b>Width</b> and <b>Height</b>
of the image, either in <b>pixels, cm, inches</b> or expressed as a
<b>percent</b> of the size stored internally in the graphic object.
Enter the desired values and hit enter.  Note that a readout at the very bottom
of the panel always reports the size of the image in pixels, regardless of
the units setting.</p>

<p>By default, changing one of <b>Width</b> or <b>Height</b> also changes
the other, so that the overall aspect ratio is preserved.
If you wish to disable
this behavior, uncheck the <b>Constrain Width/Height</b> option.  This will
allow you to change one dimension without affecting the other, stretching the
graphic object as necessary.  This will also make sensitive the <b>Maintain
Aspect Ratio</b> box.  When this is checked, the graphic object is shrunk in
one dimension such that its aspect ratio is the same as when the panel was
first opened.  However, the overall size of the exported image is not changed;
this is accomplished by filling the newly available space with background
color.  So for example, suppose the object was initially 6" x 4".  Then it
is stretched (with <b>Constrain Width/Height</b> unchecked) to 9" x 12".  Thus
it will appear stretched in the y-direction by a factor of 2.  Now if the
<b>Maintain Aspect Ratio</b> button is checked, the overall image remains at
9" x 12" but the graphic object is reduced to 9" x 6", centered vertically
within the 9" x 12" image area.  Now the object has the same aspect ratio,
3:2, as initially.</p>

<p><b>Resolution</b> is used to specify the desired resolution in <b>dpi</b>
or <b>dpc</b> of the image.  Select the desired units, enter the value and hit
enter.  This only affects the final size in pixels of the image, and is also
stored in some file formats such as JPG and TIF to determine the output size
when printing the image from a graphics application.  Resolution does not
apply to EMF+ or Clipboard EMF as they are vector formats.</p>

<p><b>Color Space</b> affects how the colors are represented in the
exported file.  All formats support the <b>RGB</b> color space which is that
used by most computer monitors.  Additionally, <b>CMYK</b> is supported by JPG
and TIF files.  This is often used for color matching to laser printers.  Other
colorspaces are <b><a href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/Color/sRGB">sRGB</a></b>,
a standard internet colorspace supported by PNG, and <b>YCbCr</b>
(used in televisions and video equipment) supported by JPG.</p>

<p>The <b>Background</b> color may be altered by simply selecting a new color
from the drop-down box.  Background color is used to fill in areas of the
graphic object which have not been drawn on, as well as areas outside the
graphic object if <b>Maintain Aspect Ratio</b> is selected.  If <b>Format</b> is
one of: <b>GIF, PNG, BMP, Clipboard EMF</b> then you will also be able to select
a transparency level for the background color.</p>

<p>The bottom of the panel presents you with three options.
<ul><li><b>OK</b> - Performs the export using the specified options.  If the
file already exists, you will be asked to confirm that you want to overwrite
the existing file.  If the extension does not match that normally used by the
given file format, you will also be asked if you really want to proceed.</li>
<li><b>Print...</b> - Opens the <a href="#PrintGrob">Graphical Object Print
Preview</a> panel so that you can print the graphical object.</li>
<li><b>Cancel</b> - Closes the panel.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="PrinterSetup">Printer Setup</a></h2>

<p>
In the unix environment, printing from MOE is generally performed via the 
<tt>/bin/lp</tt> or the <tt>/bin/lpr</tt> commands. 
If these commands are invalid, they can be substituted by specifying the RC
variable <tt>print.postscript.lp</tt> in the MOE resource configuration
file (<tt>moe-rc</tt>), or via the SVL command
<a href="../moe/fcnref/rc.htm">SetRC</a>.</p>
<p>
For example, if the printing command for the printer named <i>pqr</i>
