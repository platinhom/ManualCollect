<p>The QuaSAR-CombiDesign application is used to select a diverse
collection of compounds from a virtual combinatorial library of compounds.
The virtual library is constructed by functionalizing <i>scaffold</i>
molecules.  QuaSAR-CombiDesign creates the diverse subset by statistical
sampling of the "chemical space" spanned by all possible R-group/scaffold
substitutions.</p> 


<a name="Theory"></a>
<h2>Theory and Formulation</h2>

<p>
QuaSAR-CombiDesign is able to select diverse subsets from extremely large
virtual libraries for one simple reason: <i>the virtual library is never
enumerated</i>.  In conventional techniques one first enumerates the
library by forming all combinations of scaffolds and R-groups.  This is
followed by descriptor calculation, Principal Components Analysis and
Diverse Subset Selection.  QuaSAR-CombiDesign uses sampling techniques for
each of the sub-calculations thereby eliminating the enumeration.

<p>
The Basic Sampling Operation is used to select a random member of the
virtual library spanned by the central and R-group databases.  The Basic
Sampling Operation proceeds as follows:

<ol>
<li>Randomly select a scaffold molecule.
<li>Randomly select R-group molecules, one per attachment point on the
scaffold molecule.
<li>Construct the product.
<li>Test against Rule of Five Filter; i.e. if any of Molecular Weight,
LogP, Number of donors+acceptors, Number of rotatable bonds falls outside
pre-set limits then return to step 1 (a maximum of 1000 times).
<li>Calculate molecular descriptors on the entire product molecule.
</ol>

<p>
At the highest level, a QuaSAR-CombiDesign proceeds in three phases:

<ol>
<li><b>[PCA]</b>.  Principal components analysis.  The Basic Sampling
Operation is repeatedly performed a fixed number of times.  A mean and
covariance matrix is accumulated and diagonalized.  A linear transform
<i>Q</i> and a vector <i>u</i> are calculated such that for a given
descriptor vector <i>x</i>,
<span class="nobr"><i>Q</i>(<i>x</i>-<i>u</i>)</span>
has a mean of 0 and a variance equal to the identity matrix.
<p>

<li><b>[VAR]</b>.  Mean and Variance Estimation.  A random subset of size
<i>k</i> is repeatedly performed using the Basic Sampling Operation.  The
PCA transforms are used to de-correlate and normalize the descriptors.
The diversity metric is evaluated on each sampled subset.  In this way
the mean and variance of the diversity of a subset of size <i>k</i> is
estimated.  This allows the diversity of a subset to be measured in terms
of Z-scoring: the number of standard deviations away from random.
<p>

<li><b>[MC]</b>.  Monte Carlo Simulated Annealing.  A random subset of size
<i>k</i> is used as the starting point.  A simulated annealing calculation
is then used to randomly exchange members of the subset for random molecules
obtained with the Basic Sampling Operation.  A Metropolis rejection
criterion is used to optimize the diversity metric.
</ol>

<p>
The diversity metric is an entropy-based metric that encourages coverage
of the entire virtual library spanned by the scaffold and R-group databases;
this metric does not merely look for extreme molecules but for good coverage.

<a name="Run"></a>
<h2>Running QuaSAR-CombiDesign</h2>

<p>
To open the QuaSAR-CombiDesign panel choose
<span class="menu">MOE | Compute | QuaSAR | QuaSAR-CombiDesign</span> 
from the MOE Window.
The panel is operated in the style of a "Wizard"; that is, a sequence
of pages that specify the parameters to the calculation.  The Next and
Previous buttons are used to move between the pages.  The Start button
becomes available on the last page and is used to start the calculation.
The Cancel button can be used at any time to terminate the calculation.

<p>
<b>Page 1: Virtual Library Definition</b>.  The first page contains fields
used to specify the virtual library:

<p>
<center><img src="qcombi/pg_vl.png" alt="Virtual Library"></center>

<p>

The filenames of the databases used in a QuaSAR-CombiDesign
run are shown on this page, and can be specified using the <a
href="../combi/cdgen.htm"><b>Define and Edit Connections</b></a>
button. QuaSAR-CombiDesign generates new compounds by randomly
functionalizing scaffold molecules from the <b>Scaffold Input Database</b>
with R-groups from databases specified in the <b>Connections</b> area.
Functionalizations occur between terminal atoms named "Ax" (where x is an
integer from 0 to 9) on the scaffold molecules and terminal atoms named "A0"
("A" zero) on the R-groups. The overall functionalization "reaction" is:

</p>

<center> Scaffold-Ax + A0-R  ->  Scaffold-R ;   x = 0 to 9</center>

<p>

In bidentate connections, a second connection is made from the scaffold
to a terminal atom named "A1" in an R-group.

<p>

Scaffold structures are created by renaming the atoms at the desired
points of substitution with the tokens A0 to A9. Each scaffold molecule must
contain at least one atom named "Ax" to be recognized as a valid scaffold
by QuaSAR-CombiDesign.  Symmetric substitutions are achieved by giving
multiple atoms the same name.  Bidentate substitutions are also supported,
as are substitutions through higher-order bonds.  Bidentate connections
are specified when defining a new connection (<b>Define and Edit
Connections</b>).  Naming
non-terminal atoms "Ax" can result in errors and unreasonable structures.

</p>

<p>

R-groups are created by renaming the atom at the desired point of
substitution with "A0". R-groups must contain one and only one "A0" atom to
be correctly recognized by QuaSAR-CombiDesign. R-groups may also contain a
terminal atom labeled A1, in which case the group can be used in a bidentate
connection.  If the group has other atoms labeled "Ax" (x is not 0 or 1),
then these can be use as substitution points in subsequent invocations
of QuaSAR-CombiDesign.  In this way you can set up a multi-step "reaction".
You may label a multiply-bonded atom with "A0" or "A1", in which case the
substitution will be made through a higher-order bond.  Naming non-terminal
atoms "A0" will result in errors and unreasonable structures.

</p>

<p>
For more information about scaffolds, R-groups, and connections, please
see the chapter on <a href="../combi/cdgen.htm">QuaSAR-CombiGen</a>.


<p>
<b>Page 2: Molecular Descriptors</b>.  Molecular descriptors are calculated
on each product (member of the virtual library) and not just on individual
R-groups and scaffold molecules.  The Molecular Descriptors page specifies
which QuaSAR descriptors to use to describe a virtual library
member:

<p>
<center><img src="qcombi/pg_desc.png" alt="Descriptors"></center>

<p>
Select the descriptors to use in the calculation.  If none are selected
then all descriptors will be used.  Note that only 2D descriptors are
employed by QuaSAR-CombiDesign.

<p>
<b>Page 3: Rule of Five Filter</b>.  Virtual Library compounds are constructed
by randomly choosing a scaffold molecule and functionalizing it with random
R-groups.  The Rule of Five Page is used to reject virtual library members
with a collection of filters:

<p>
<center><img src="qcombi/pg_rule.png" alt="Rule of 5"></center>

<p>
A constructed virtual library member will only be used if its Molecular
Weight, LogP (octanol/water), number of donors + acceptors and number of
rotatable
bonds fall between the limits specified in the Rule of Five Filter page.
If any one of the tests fails then the constructed molecule is rejected
and another is randomly chosen.

<p>
<b>Page 4: Principal components analysis</b>.  The diversity calculation
ultimately proceeds in a descriptor space that is uncorrelated and normalized.
In order to construct the affine transform of the original descriptors,
a Principal Components Analysis (PCA) is conducted using a sampling
method.  Consult <a href="cluster.htm">QuaSAR-Cluster</a> for more details
on the theory behind the PCA calculation.  The Principal Components Analysis
page specifies the parameters to the PCA calculation:

<p>
<center><img src="qcombi/pg_pca.png" alt="Principal Components"></center>

<p>
The <b>PCA Samples</b> field indicates the number of iterations to use
in the PCA sampling step.  Values above 30,000 are generally above the
diminishing returns level.  The details of Condition Limit and Component Limit
can be found in <a href="cluster.htm">QuaSAR-Cluster</a>.

<p>
<b>Page 5: Diverse Subset Output</b>.  This page controls the destination
and size of the output database as well as the simulation control
parameters:

<p>
<center><img src="qcombi/pg_div.png" alt="Diverse Subset"></center>

<p>
The <b>Subset Size</b> field indicates the desired number of molecules
in the output database and <b>Output Database</b> is the filename of the
output database.  <b>Subset Samples</b> contains the number of random
subsets of size Subset Size that will be sampled in order to estimate
the mean and variance of the diversity of a random subset.
<b>Temperature Steps</b> controls how many iterations will be performed
per temperature value.  This is calculated as <i>ks</i> where <i>k</i> is
the Subset Size and <i>s</i> is the value entered for Temperature Steps.
<b>Temperature Scale</b> is the factor by which the Monte Carlo temperature
will be scaled from one outer iteration to the next.  The simulation will
stop when the temperature falls below 1e-6 (it starts at 1.0).

<p>
<b>Page 6: Start Simulation</b>.  This is the final page of QuaSAR-CombiDesign.
The Start button is activated and must be pressed to begin the calculation.

<p><b>Note:</b> QuaSAR-CombiDesign <b>cannot</b> write to an output database
that is currently open; an Open Database error will occur. Closing the database
and reinitiating QuaSAR-CombiDesign will correct this error.</p> 


<a name="Output"></a>
<h2>QuaSAR-CombiDesign Output</h2>

<p>
QuaSAR-CombiDesign outputs to both the CLI and to the output database.
CLI output echoes the process which QuaSAR-CombiDesign is currently
performing, and can be used to monitor the progress of the calculation.
Database output consists of the generated compounds, and the molecular
fragments from which they were generated.</p>

The CLI output mirrors the QuaSAR-CombiDesign algorithm, and is written
in the following sequence:

<ol>
<li>QuaSAR_CombiDesign run options listed in a tagged vector.</li>
<li>A list of the Scaffold and R-group databases; the name of the associated
attachment point on the scaffold is given with each R-group database.
<li>A summary of any errors found in the Scaffold and R-group databases.</li>
<li>A list of the descriptors used in the diversity analysis.</li>
<li>The number of principal components determined by the PCA.</li>
<li>The average and variance energies of random subset samples.</li>
<li>The energy, Z-score and temperature after every 100
Monte Carlo selection cycles. </li>
</ol>   

<p>

The output database from a QuaSAR-CombiDesign run contains an output molecule
field as well as input fragment molecule fields.  The "mol" field contains
the compounds generated by QuaSAR-CombiDesign.  The scaffold field "C"
and the R-group fields contain the scaffold (central) and R-group fragments
from which the compound was generated.

<p>
The scaffold fragments are assigned a name of the following form:

<blockquote>
<i>Cn.scaff_name</i>
</blockquote>

<p>
where:

<ul>
<li><i>n</i> is the entry number of the scaffold in the scaffold database.
<li><i>scaff_name</i> is the name, if any, of the original scaffold molecule.
</ul>

<p>The R-group fields are named according to their attachment point on
the scaffold, and the names of the individual R-group fragments are the
same as in the original R-group databases.

<p>
The output molecules are
named according to the scaffold and R-group fragments from which they
are built.  The scaffold name is as described above.
Each R-group in the product is assigned a name of the
following form:

<blockquote>
<i>port.n.rgp_name</i>
</blockquote>

<p>
where:

<ul>
<li><i>port</i> is the name of the attachment point, e.g. <tt>A1</tt>.
<li><i>n</i> is the entry number of the fragment in the R-group database.
<li><i>rgp_name</i> is the name, if any, of the original R-group molecule.
</ul>

<p>Here is an example of the name of an output molecule:

<blockquote>
C2.benzene/A1.5.F/A2.3.N/A3.1.Cl
</blockquote>

<p>

</p>

<p>In the Monte Carlo phase of the simulation, QuaSAR-CombiDesign writes a 
new diverse subset to the output database every 5000 cycles. 
The Monte Carlo simulation will continue until the system temperature is 
below 1e-06.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> Caution must be used when running QuaSAR-CombiDesign with small 
databases; infinite loops may result if the subset size is larger than
the space spanned by all possible scaffold/R-group substitutions.</p>
