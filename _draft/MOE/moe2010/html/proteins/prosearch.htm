<p>MOE-SearchPDB searches for protein structures that are homologous to a
query sequence.  The search is performed on a database of protein
structures and sequences that have been clustered into families.
</p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>

<p>A two stage search strategy is used.
First, a fast scan is performed to create an initial list of
candidates.  Second, the list is then narrowed by Z-Score evaluations.
</p>

<p><b>Fast Scan.</b>
The initial scan is performed using a generalized version of the
Fasta methodology [Pearson 1996].
Any family containing at least one high-scoring
sequence is placed on the list of candidates for further inspection.
</p>

<p>An expectation value (E-Value) is determined
for each sequence.  The E-Value is an estimate
of the number of possible false positives one might expect if
all sequences scoring equal to or better than the alignment score
from which the E-Value is derived were accepted.  High E-Values correspond
to poor scores; low E-Values correspond to good scores.
</p>

<p><b>Evaluation.</b>
The list is systematically reduced using pre-defined thresholds.
For each family, the best E-Value of all of its sequences is compared
to two values: E-Value Cutoff and E-Value Accept.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>
If the E-Value is higher
than E-Value Cutoff, the family is rejected.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
If the E-Value is lower than E-Value Accept, the family is accepted and
reported without any further evaluations.  In this case, the word <i>Good</i>
is shown in the Z-Score column of the <b>Results</b> list.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
If the E-Value is between E-Value Accept and E-Value Cutoff, the Z-Score for
the family is calculated.  The Z-Score is an estimate of the statistical
significance of an alignment score.  It is calculated by generating a
distribution of scores by repeated alignments of random permutations of the
query sequence and the candidate family. The number of randomized alignments
performed is limited by the <b>Z Iterations</b> parameter.  The alignment score
is then converted to a Z-Score by subtracting the mean of this distribution and
dividing by its standard deviation.  The Z-score is thus an estimate of the
likelihood that sequences are related.  Roughly speaking, Z-scores of about 6
can be viewed as significant, although one must take care to avoid false
positives.  Scores of about 7 indicate that the sequences are very likely to be
related, and scores above 8 indicate that the sequences are related with near
certainty.
</p>

<p>
Families whose Z-Scores are below <b>Z Cutoff</b> are rejected.  The default
Z Cutoff is 6; this can be altered in the MOE-SearchPDB Settings Panel.
</p>

<p>The results of the Z-Score calculations are shown as the search
progresses. Families are then reported in the <b>Results</b>
list from which they can be examined and loaded into MOE.
</p>
</li>

</ul>

<p>Search parameters control the fast scan and Z-Score procedures, as well as
the thresholds that determine which families will be reported as likely
homologues to the query.</p>

<h2><a name="Running">Running MOE-SearchPDB</a></h2>

<p>The MOE-SearchPDB panel can be opened from either the MOE window or
the sequence editor by choosing:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<b style="white-space:nowrap">MOE | Compute | Biopolymer | PDB Search</b>
</li>
<li><b>SE | Homology | PDB Search</b></li>
</ul>

<p align="center">
<img src="prosearch/searchpdb.png" alt="MOE-SearchPDB Panel" />
</p>

<p> The protein sequence used for the search is specified in the
<b>Query</b> area of the panel.  A sequence can be entered in several
ways:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
A sequence may be typed directly into the area.
</li>

<li>
<b>Chain</b> buttons <b>1</b> to <b>6</b> enter the sequences of the
specified chains.
</li>

<li>
A sequence can be pasted from the clipboard using the <b>Paste Query</b>
button.
The Sequence Editor can be used to copy a chain's sequence onto
the clipboard.  Position
the cursor over the chain number of the chain to be copied.  Choose
<b style="white-space:nowrap">SE | Chain Popup | Residues | To Clipboard</b>.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Press the <b>Search</b> button to begin the search.</p>

<p>The query sequence is aligned against each
family in the homology databank, and E-Values and Z-Scores
are calculated.  Families meeting the
specified thresholds are inserted into the <b>Results</b> list.
</p>

<p>While the search is in progress, the Search button becomes
<b>Stop Search</b>.  If the search is interrupted, any results which have
already passed the E-Value acceptance test or the Z Cutoff test will remain in
the list.  All other candidates will be removed.
</p>

<h2><a name="SettingParameters" />Setting the Search Parameters</h2>

<p>
Pressing the <b>Settings</b> button raises the Settings panel, which controls
various parameters used in the MOE-SearchPDB calculation.

<a name="LoadingResults" /><h2>Loading Results into MOE</h2>

To load a result, either double-click on a reported candidate in
the <b>Results</b> area, or select it in the list and press the
<b>Load Alignment</b> button above the results area.
The MOE-SearchPDB: Load Alignment panel appears, displaying the query sequence
aligned to the family.
