<h2><A NAME="INTRO">Introduction</A></h2>

<p>Alignment determines the correspondences between residues of two or more
protein chains.  An underlying assumption is that the chains to be
aligned are all related.  MOE's protein alignment tool, Protein Align, can
align any number of protein sequences.  In addition to using
<em>sequence-only</em> information (i.e. residue identities),
it employs <em>sequence-derived</em> information (e.g.
predicted secondary structure) as well as <em>structure-based</em>
information when computing a multiple-sequence alignment.  Moreover, the
structure-based information can be used even in situations where
structural information is not available for every protein chain &mdash;
Protein Align can handle mixed sets of structural and sequence-only
information data.  Finally, an alignment can be fine-tuned in MOE
using alignment constraints and manual re-positioning of residues.

<p><font color="#ff0000"><b>Tip</b></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also possible
to manually align sequences in the Sequence Editor. For instance, to slide
an entire chain, position the cursor over the first or any other residue
in the chain to move. Press <tt>Ctrl</tt> and drag the middle mouse button
right or left depending on the new alignment position.  As the chain is
being moved, the cursor changes to a crosshair and a red box is drawn
around the residue that was clicked on. For more information, see the
section entitled Moving Residues in 
<a href="../moe/gui/se.html">Sequence Editor</a>.


<h2><A NAME="METHODOLOGY">Methodology</A></h2>

<p>Protein Align implements a modified version of the alignment methodology
originally introduced into molecular biology by [Needleman 1970]. In
this approach, alignments are computed by optimizing a function based on
residue similarity scores (obtained from applying an amino acid
substitution matrix to pairs of aligned residues) and gap penalties.
Penalties are imposed for introducing and extending gaps in one sequence
with respect to another.  The final optimized function value is
referred to as the <em>alignment score</em>.  When aligning multiple
sequences, Protein Align attempts to optimize the so-called <em>sum of
pairs</em> score, i.e. the sum of all the separate pairwise
(one chain against one chain) alignment scores.

<p>The basis of sequence-only alignment is the <em>amino acid substitution
matrix</em>. MOE includes matrices derived directly from families of aligned
proteins, as well as matrices derived by application of an evolutionary model
to a set of closely related matrices. These matrices reside in the
directory <tt>$MOE/lib/matrix</tt>. 

<p>Protein Align is capable of computing alternate similarity matrices for
use in the Needleman-Wunsch procedure, as well as position-specific gap
penalties. For example, Protein Align can adjust the similarity matrix and gap
penalties using either secondary structure predictions or actual secondary
structure assignments (Kabsch and Sander's DSSP assignments, as calculated
by MOE).

<p>While the Needleman-Wunsch approach to sequence alignment permits, in
principle, the simultaneous alignment of an arbitrary number of chains,
calculations become computationally impractical once the number of chains
exceeds four.  Therefore, multiple alignment protocols are generally built
upon the repeated pairwise alignment of groups of aligned chains. However,
a theoretical difficulty arises in the scoring of new gaps whenever there
are pre-existing gaps in one or both of the alignment groups. Protein Align
correctly calculates the gap scores in group to group alignments using a
novel application of the 
<nobr><a href="#ASearch">A* search technique</a></nobr>.

<p>Protein Align performs multiple sequence alignment in
four stages, all of which are parameterized in the Protein Alignment Settings
panel:

<OL>
<Li><B>Initial pairwise build-up:</B>

The initial estimate of the alignment can be calculated
in one of two ways :
<ul>

<p><li><b>Progressive</b>: Aligns chains 1 and 2, then aligns chain 3 to
the resulting alignment. This continues until all chains have been processed.
This method may be sensitive to chain order.

<p><li><b>Tree-based</b>: Pre-calculates all the alignment scores between
each pair of chains. The alignment is built by aligning the chain or
chains with the highest pairwise score. The pairwise score between two
groups is defined as the maximum of all scores between their respective
chains.  This method is not sensitive to chain order, but does involve a
higher computational overhead.</ul></p>

<Li><B>Round-robin realignment:</B>

The initial estimate of the alignment (or current alignment, if stage 1 was
skipped) is refined by a single round-robin series of realignments,
wherein each chain in succession is extracted from the global alignment
and re-aligned against the remaining chains.  </p>

<Li><B>Randomized iterative refinement:</B>

The results of the initial and round-robin stages of the
alignment process can be sensitive to the order in which the chains are
processed. To reduce this sensitivity, a series of realignments can be
performed in which the group of aligned chains is randomly partitioned
into two groups, and a two-way alignment of the subsets is performed. If
the new alignment improves the alignment score, it is accepted; otherwise
it is rejected.  </p>

<Li><B>Structure-based realignment:</B>

Chains that possess coordinates for all their alpha carbons can be
realigned taking into account their structure.  From the current initial
estimate of the correct alignment, a new similarity matrix is generated
using the relative alpha carbon coordinates that result from a
multi-body superposition.  This matrix is used to realign just these
alpha carbon populated chains. This procedure is then repeated until the
Root Mean Square Distance (RMSD) of the superposition fails to improve. At
this point, the structured chains are re-introduced as an indivisible unit
among the unstructured chains, and steps 1 through 3 are repeated.

</OL>

<h2><A NAME="HOWTO">Running Protein Align</A></h2>

<p>The Protein Alignment panel can be opened from either the MOE window or the Sequence Editor by choosing

<ul>
<li><nobr><b>MOE | Compute | Biopolymer | Align</nobr></b>
<li><nobr><b>SE | Homology | Align</nobr></b>
</ul>


<p><center>
<img src="align/align.png" alt="Protein Alignment Panel">
</center>

<p>
The Protein Align panel presents a listbox containing all protein chains in
the system. The list selection mirrors the chain selection in the sequence
editor. The controls at the top of the panel allow for the assignment of
selected protein chains to groups for purposes of group-to-group or
sequence-to-group alignment, or to allow specified chains to be excluded
altogether from the alignment calculation.

Chains in the "*" group are treated as individual sequences, and are not grouped
with any other chains. Chains in the "i" group will be ignored by the
alignment operation. Chains marked with "A","B","C","D" or "E" will
be grouped with other chains with the same letter and treated as a block in
the alignment operation. Press the <b>Align</b> button to assign all selected
chains to the "*" group, and all unselected chains to the "i" group. Press
the <b>Partition</b> button to assign the selected and unselected chains
to different groups, thus allowing group-to-group alignment between the
unselected and selected chains. Press the <b>Freeze</b> button to
assign the selected chains to one group, and the unselected chains to the
"*" group.

<p>The remaining options in the panel are:


<table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5" width="100%">

<p>Press <b>OK</b> or <b>Apply</b> to perform the protein alignment. After
pressing <b>Apply</b>, previous atom coordinates and sequence alignment
positions can be restored by pressing <b>Undo</b>. Once the
alignment procedure is completed, a matrix of percentage
residue identity values is written to the 
<a href="../moe/gui/svlcommands.html">SVL Commands window</a>. 
The values in each column represent the
percentage of the chain's residues which are paired with identical
residues in the chains of each row in the final alignment. Press <b>Table</b>

<h2><A NAME="CONSTRAINTS">Creating Alignment Constraints</A></h2>

<p>MOE provides tools to create and manage alignment constraints.  In MOE,
a single alignment constraint is maintained as a set of residues.  There
are no restrictions to the size or composition of the residue set
constituting the constraint -- residues may belong to any combination of
chains in the system.  When performing an alignment, Protein Align attempts to
minimize the number of constraint violations. A constraint violation
occurs whenever a pair of residues in a constraint are not aligned in the
same column.

<p>You create alignment constraints in the Sequence Editor by choosing
<nobr><b>SE | Edit | Constrain Residues</b></nobr>. A prompt appears
in the CLI of the Sequence Editor, asking you to select residues to be
constrained. Click on residues to add them to the current constraint.
Residues belonging to a constraint are linked by a blue line.

<p><center>
<iMG SRC="align/c2.gif" alt="Constraints Drawn in the Sequence Editor">
</P></center>

<p>Press New Constraint (in the CLI prompt) to end the current
constraint and begin a new one. To remove the constraint prompt, press
<tt>ESC</tt> .

<p>New constraints can also be created from within the <b>Residue
Alignment Constraint</b> panel as described below.


<p>The <nobr><b>SE | Edit | Unconstrain Residues</nobr></b>
command removes the residues selected in the
Sequence Editor from all constraints to which they belong.


<h2><a name="ManagingConstraints">Managing Alignment Constraints</a></h2>

<p>The Residue Alignment Constraints panel shows existing constraints and
the positions of their residues. It acts somewhat like a manager in that
it allows you to view and modify constraints (by adding or removing
residues), and create new ones. This panel also lets you select residues
belonging to constraints allowing you to quickly find specific constraints
in the Sequence Editor.

<p>The Residue Alignment Constraints panel is opened from either the
Sequence Editor or the MOE Window by choosing
<nobr><b>Window | Alignment Constraints</nobr></b>.

<p ALIGN=center>
<iMG SRC="align/conwin.gif" alt="Residue Alignment Constraints Panel"></P>

<p>For every "shown" constraint, the panel gives the alignment positions
of the constrained residues as well as the names and positions of
individual residues. <b>Shown/Hidden</b> indicate the visibility status of
constraints.  When a constraint is shown, it is drawn (in blue) in the
Sequence Editor, and its residues are listed in the above panel.
Conversely, a hidden constraint is not drawn in the Sequence Editor, nor
are its residues listed in the panel. You can toggle the visibility of
each constraint by double-clicking on its Shown/Hidden line. To control
the visibility of all constraints, use the Hide All and Show All buttons
(see below).

<p><a name="ASearch"><h2>Appendix: A* Search Algorithm</a></h2>
<p>
The A* Search algorithm is a procedure to find the best path in a directed
acyclic graph with associated edge scores.  It is a best-first search algorithm
that makes use of a heuristic to evaluate the score of unsearched portions of
the graph.  It has been extensively studied in the context of tree searches;
however, all of its graph search properties are not generally known.
Therefore, in this section, we will outline the algorithm and offer proofs of
its correctness and properties.

<p>Let <i>G</i>* be a directed acyclic graph specified by a collection of
nodes, or vertices, <i>V</i>, and a collection of edges each specified by
an ordered pair of nodes (<i>m</i>,<i>n</i>) and a positive score <i>s</i>
(we say that the edge from <i>m</i> to <i>n</i> has score <i>s</i>).  This
definition does not exclude the possibility that more than one score can
be associated between nodes <i>m</i> and <i>n</i>.  A <i>path</i> in
<i>G</i>* is a sequence of edges with the property that each edge (except
the first) has its &quot;from&quot; node equal to the &quot;to&quot; node
of the preceding edge.  The <i>score</i> of a path is the product of the
edge scores of the edges in the path.  (Note that by taking logarithms in
all subsequent formulae, the A* search can be applied to summation-based
scoring mechanisms).  A path from <i>m</i> to <i>n</i> is called
<i>optimal</i> if its score is greater than or equal to all other paths
from <i>m</i> to <i>n</i>.

<p>We distinguish two distinct nodes in <i>V</i>, the <i>source node</i>,
<i>r</i>, and the <i>destination node</i>, <i>f</i>. We define a <i>complete
path</i> to be a path that originates at <i>r</i> and terminates at <i>f</i>.
The primary objective of the search is to find an optimal complete path.  As
we shall see, the A* search algorithm solves this problem and has the useful
property of being able to produce all best paths.

<p>For each node <i>n</i> in <i>G</i>*, define the <i>forward score</i>,
<i>A</i>(<i>n</i>) to be 1 if <i>n&nbsp;=&nbsp;r</i> and the score of an
optimal path from <i>r</i> to <i>n</i> otherwise.  Similarly, we define the
<i>backward score</i>, <i>B</i>(<i>n</i>) to be 1 if <i>n&nbsp;=&nbsp;f</i>
and the score of an optimal path from <i>n</i> to <i>f</i> otherwise.  Note
that the quantity <i>A</i>(<i>n</i>)<i>B</i>(<i>n</i>) is the score of an
optimal complete path through <i>n</i>.

<p>The A* search algorithm assumes the existence of a <i>heuristic</i>
<i>backward score</i>; that is, for each node <i>n</i> an estimate<i>
b</i>(<i>n</i>) of <i>B</i>(<i>n</i>) with the property that
<i>b</i>(<i>n</i>)&nbsp;&gt;=<i>&nbsp;B</i>(<i>n</i>).  In the context of
a graph search, the A* algorithm assumes the existence of a
<i>monotone</i> heuristic.  A monotone heuristic has the property that for
every edge (<i>m</i>,<i>n</i>,<i>s</i>) from node <i>m</i> to node
<i>n</i>, <i>b</i>(<i>m</i>)&nbsp;&gt;=&nbsp;<i>sb</i>(<i>n</i>).

<p>We now describe the A* search algorithm in detail.  The algorithm
constructs subgraph, <i>G</i>, of <i>G</i>* with the property that
<i>G</i> will contain all of the &quot;best&quot; paths of <i>G</i>* (the
notion of best will be discussed below).  The algorithm maintains two sets
of nodes: the set <i>O</i> of <i>open</i> nodes (nodes yet to be
searched), and the set <i>C</i> of <i>closed</i> nodes (nodes that have
been searched).  All nodes in <i>G</i> are either open or closed.  During
the course of the search each node <i>n</i> in <i>G</i> will contain an
estimate <i>a</i>(<i>n</i>) of <i>A</i>(<i>n</i>).  The A* search
algorithm proceeds as follows.  

<p>

<ol>
<li>
[<B>Initialization</B>] Initially, <i>G</i> contains <i>r</i> and no edges.
Set <i>C&nbsp;=&nbsp;</i>{}, <i>O</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;{<i>r</i>},
<i>a</i>(<i>r</i>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.  Fix a constant <i>t</i>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;0
(this controls the termination criteria).
<p>
<li>
[<B>Selection</B>] Let <i>m</i> be a node in <i>O</i> with maximal heuristic
score <i>a</i>(<i>m</i>)<i>b</i>(<i>m</i>) over all other nodes in <i>O</i>.
Set <i>C=C+</i>{<i>m</i>} and <i>O</i>=<i>O</i>&#173;{<i>m</i>}.
<p>
<li>
[<B>Termination</B>] If <i>f</i>  is in <i>C</i> and
<i>a</i>(<i>m</i>)<i>b</i>(<i>m</i>)&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;<i>ta</i>(<i>f</i>)
then terminate the algorithm.
<p>
<li>
[<B>Expansion</B>]  For each edge (<i>m</i>,<i>n</i>,<i>s</i>) in <i>G</i>*
(all edges originating from <i>m</i>) add <i>n</i> and the edge
(<i>m</i>,<i>n</i>,<i>s</i>) to <i>G</i>.  If <i>n</i> is in <i>O</i> set
<i>a</i>(<i>n</i>)=max{<i>a</i>(<i>n</i>),<i>sa</i>(<i>m</i>)}; otherwise if
<i>n</i> is not in <i>C</i> then set <i>a</i>(<i>n</i>)=<i>sa</i>(<i>m</i>)
and <i>O</i>=<i>O</i>+{<i>n</i>}.  Go to Step 2.
</ol>

<p>
The construction in the Expansion step of the algorithm guarantees that
<i>a</i>(<i>n</i>) is the score of some path from <i>r</i> to <i>n</i>;
however, the path is not necessarily optimal in <i>G</i>* or even in <i>G</i>.
Therefore, in general, <i>a</i>(<i>n</i>)&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;<i>A</i>(<i>n</i>).

<p>
The proof of correctness will require a number of lemmas each of which is
interesting on its own and provide insight into the behavior of the A*
algorithm.

<p>
<blockquote>
<B>Lemma 1</B>.  <i>Let p be a node
in G</i>*<i>.  If m and n are two nodes on an optimal
path in G</i>*<i> from r to p in which m precedes n then A</i>(<i>m</i>)<i>b</i>(<i>m</i>)&nbsp;&gt;=&nbsp;<i>A</i>(<i>n</i>)<i>b</i>(<i>n</i>).

<p>
<B>Proof</B>.  It is enough to
prove the case where <i>m</i> is the immediate predecessor of
<i>n</i> on an optimal path.

<p>
Consider such an optimal path from <i>r</i> to <i>p</i>
and let <i>s</i> be the score of the edge in the path joining
<i>m</i> to <i>n</i>.  By truncating the given path to <i>p</i>
at <i>n</i> one obtains an optimal path from <i>r</i> to <i>n</i>.
 If this were false, then one could find a better path from <i>r</i>
to <i>p</i> than the given one contradicting the fact that the
given path is optimal.  The same remark applies to <i>m</i> and
so <i>A</i>(<i>n</i>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>A</i>(<i>m</i>)<i>s</i>;
hence, using the monotone property

<p>
<center><i>A</i>(<i>n</i>)<i>b</i>(<i>n</i>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>A</i>(<i>m</i>)<i>sb</i>(<i>n</i>)&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;<i>A</i>(<i>m</i>)<i>b</i>(<i>m</i>)</center>
<p>
as required.
</blockquote>

<p>
This lemma states that along an optimal path, the monotone heuristic property
guarantees that the upper bound on the score of an optimal complete path
<i>decreases</i>.  The second lemma concerns the forward score estimate
<i>a</i>(<i>n</i>) of <i>A</i>(<i>n</i>).  Recall that, in general,
<i>a</i>(<i>n</i>)&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;<i>A</i>(<i>n</i>); however, equality is
assured at specific points in the algorithm.

<p>
<blockquote>
<B>Lemma 2</B>.  <i>On every iteration of the A* search algorithm, a node n in
the open set O with maximal a</i>(<i>n</i>)<i>b</i>(<i>n</i>)<i> (in particular,
the node selected for expansion) has the property that
a</i>(<i>n</i>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>A</i>(<i>n</i>).

<p>
<B>Proof</B>.  The proof is by induction on the iteration number of the
algorithm.  On the first iteration, <i>O</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;{<i>r</i>} and since,
by definition, <i>A</i>(<i>r</i>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;1&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>a</i>(<i>r</i>)
the property holds.

<p>
Suppose that there exists a <i>k</i> such that after each iteration less that
or equal to <i>k</i> the property held and consider iteration
<i>k&nbsp;</i>+&nbsp;1.

<p>
Suppose that prior to expansion node <i>n</i> in <i>O</i> has maximal
<i>a</i>(<i>n</i>)<i>b</i>(<i>n</i>).  Since <i>k</i>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;1 it must
be that <i>n</i>&nbsp;&lt;&gt;&nbsp;<i>r</i>.  Consider an optimal path in
<i>G</i>* from <i>r</i> to <i>n</i>.  Let <i>p</i> be the first node in
<i>O</i> on this path and let <i>m</i> be its immediate predecessor (<i>m</i>
is necessarily in <i>C</i>).  Since <i>m</i> was selected for expansion on some
prior iteration, it must have had a maximal heuristic score and hence the
induction hypothesis implies that for <i>m</i>,
<i>a</i>(<i>m</i>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>A</i>(<i>m</i>).

<p>
During the expansion of <i>m</i>, the node <i>p</i> was either closed or added
to <i>O</i>.  If <i>p</i> was closed then it was expanded on some prior
iteration and, like <i>m</i>, <i>a</i>(<i>p</i>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>A</i>(<i>p</i>).
If <i>p</i> was not closed, then it was added to <i>O</i> with
<i>a</i>(<i>p</i>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>a</i>(<i>m</i>)<i>s</i>; hence

<p>
<center><i>a</i>(<i>p</i>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>a</i>(<i>m</i>)<i>s</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>A</i>(<i>m</i>)<i>s</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>A</i>(<i>p</i>)
</center>

<p>
since <i>m</i> is the immediate predecessor of <i>p</i> on an optimal path
from <i>r</i> to <i>p</i> (by the argument in Lemma 1).  Since both
<i>a</i>(<i>m</i>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>A</i>(<i>m</i>) and
<i>a</i>(<i>p</i>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>A</i>(<i>p</i>), we have that

<p>
<center>
<i>a</i>(<i>p</i>)<i>b</i>(<i>p</i>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>A</i>(<i>p</i>)<i>b</i>(<i>p</i>)&nbsp;&gt;=&nbsp;<i>A</i>(<i>n</i>)<i>b</i>(<i>n</i>)&nbsp;&gt;=&nbsp;<i>a</i>(<i>n</i>)<i>b</i>(<i>n</i>)
</center>

<p>
where the first inequality follows from Lemma 1 and the second from the fact
that, in general, <i>a</i>(<i>n</i>)&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;<i>A</i>(<i>n</i>).  Since
both <i>m</i> and <i>n</i> are in <i>O</i>, and <i>n</i> has maximal heuristic
score, we have
<i>a</i>(<i>n</i>)<i>b</i>(<i>n</i>)&nbsp;&gt;=&nbsp;<i>a</i>(<i>p</i>)<i>b</i>(<i>p</i>); therefore

<p>
<center>
<i>a</i>(<i>p</i>)<i>b</i>(<i>p</i>)&nbsp;&gt;=&nbsp;<i>A</i>(<i>n</i>)<i>b</i>(<i>n</i>)&nbsp;&gt;=&nbsp;<i>a</i>(<i>n</i>)<i>b</i>(<i>n</i>)&nbsp;&gt;=&nbsp;<i>a</i>(<i>p</i>)<i>b</i>(<i>p</i>)
</center>

<p>
which implies that <i>a</i>(<i>n</i>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>A</i>(<i>n</i>) as
required.

<p>
The preceding lemma states, in particular, that when the algorithm terminates,
<i>a</i>(<i>f</i>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>A</i>(<i>f</i>); i.e. that the score of the
optimal complete path is, in fact, computed by the algorithm.  The correctness
of the A* search algorithm is given by the following

<p>
<blockquote>
<B>Theorem</B>.  <i>When the A* algorithm terminates, every complete path with
a score greater than or equal to tA</i>(<i>f</i>)<i> is contained in G, the
subgraph built by the algorithm</i>.

<p>
<B>Proof</B>.  On termination <i>f</i>  is in <i>C</i>, and every node,
<i>p</i>, in <i>O</i> is such that
<i>a</i>(<i>p</i>)<i>b</i>(<i>p</i>)&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;<i>tA</i>(<i>f</i>).
(By Lemma 2, since <i>f</i>  is in <i>C</i>, it must be that
<i>a</i>(<i>f</i>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>A</i>(<i>f</i>); hence
<i>a</i>(<i>p</i>)<i>b</i>(<i>p</i>)&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;<i>tA</i>(<i>f</i>).)

<p>
Consider a complete path in <i>G</i>* with a score
<i>S</i>&nbsp;&gt;=&nbsp;<i>tA</i>(<i>f</i>).  Suppose, in order to
produce a contradiction, that this path does not exist in <i>G</i> upon
termination.  It must, then, be that one of the nodes on the path is
open.  Let <i>n</i> be such an open node.  Necessarily,
<i>n</i>&nbsp;&lt;&gt;&nbsp;<i>r</i> since <i>r</i> was expanded on the
first iteration.  Let <i>p</i> be the first open node on an optimal path
from <i>r</i> to <i>n</i> and let <i>m</i> be its immediate predecessor on
that optimal path.  (<i>m</i> is necessarily closed).  Let <i>s</i> be the
score of the highest scoring edge connecting <i>m</i> and <i>p</i>.

<p>Using Lemma 2, the update formula of the expansion of node <i>m</i> and
the fact that <i>m</i> and <i>p</i> are on an optimal path it must be that

<p>
<center>
<i>A</i>(<i>p</i>)&nbsp;&gt;=&nbsp;<i>a</i>(<i>p</i>)&nbsp;&gt;=&nbsp;<i>sa</i>(<i>m</i>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>sA</i>(<i>m</i>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>A</i>(<i>p</i>);
</center>

<p>hence <i>A</i>(<i>p</i>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>a</i>(<i>p</i>).  Since
<i>p</i> is open,
<i>tA</i>(<i>f</i>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>ta</i>(<i>f</i>)&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<i>a</i>(<i>p</i>)<i>b</i>(<i>p</i>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>A</i>(<i>p</i>)<i>b</i>(<i>p</i>).
From Lemma 1 and the fact that the backward estimate is an overestimate,
we obtain

<p>
<center>
<i>A</i>(<i>p</i>)<i>b</i>(<i>p</i>)&nbsp;&gt;=&nbsp;<i>A</i>(<i>n</i>)<i>b</i>(<i>n</i>)&nbsp;&gt;=&nbsp;<i>A</i>(<i>n</i>)<i>B</i>(<i>n</i>).
</center>

<p>But the score, <i>S</i>, of the particular path through <i>n</i> under
consideration is less than the score of the optimal complete path through
<i>n</i>; therefore

<p>
<center>
<i>S</i>&nbsp;&gt;=&nbsp;<i>tA</i>(<i>f</i>
)&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<i>A</i>(<i>n</i>)<i>B</i>(<i>n</i>)&nbsp;&gt;=&nbsp;<i>S</i>
</center>

<p>
which is absurd.
