<a name="Introduction"><h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>MOE's Protein Consensus application is used to identify regions of
conserved structure within a set of superposed 3D protein structures,
for example, a portion of backbone sharing the same spatial configuration
over all proteins, or a common water site.  Protein Consensus can also
be used to identify outliers to this conserved structure, for example,
a divergence among the protein backbones, or a water site which exists in
only one of the proteins.

<p> The Protein Consensus application calculates a <i>consensus set</i> for
a set of proteins, then analyzes this consensus set for relationships
between the proteins.  The consensus set is constructed using such indices as the
root mean square distance (RMSD) between atoms in aligned residues.  In MOE,
a consensus set is calculated on a given alignment and 3D atom superposition.

<p> The consensus set can be visualized within both the MOE Window and the
Sequence Editor.  It can be used to improve the superposition of the input
chains -- the superposition can be recalculated using only the conserved core.
The improved superposition can, in turn, be used to improve the sequence
alignment of the input proteins.  The consensus set can further be used
to build a <i>consensus model</i>.

<p>The Protein Consensus application is useful for performing a variety
of tasks, including:


<ul>
<p><li>
Improving alignments of distantly related homologues which
are difficult to align automatically.

<p><li>
Examining multiple models of the same structure
to establish which areas are reliable.
For example, NMR data or
homology models which generate multiple independent models of the
target protein may require such analysis.

<p><li> Examining alignments and building model templates of target
families for drug development.  The kinases and matrix-metalloproteinases
are examples of such families.

</ul>

<p>The Protein Consensus panel is opened with <nobr><b>SE | Homology |
Consensus</b></nobr> in the Sequence Editor, or with <nobr><b>MOE | Compute |
Biopolymer | Consensus</b></nobr> in the MOE Window.

<a name="Definitions">
<h2>Consensus Set</h2>

<p>The consensus set is calculated on a molecular system comprising a
set of aligned, superposed proteins and a collection of waters for each
protein.  One of the protein chains is designated the <i>master chain</i>.
This will be the chain used as a template when creating consensus models.
The master chain can also be taken into account when the consensus set is
calculated, to bias the consensus set toward conserving the properties of
the residues of the master chain.

<p>The consensus set specifies conserved protein regions and conserved
water sites.  The consensus set can thus be treated as a composition of
two consensus sets: the <i>protein consensus set</i>, and the <i>water
consensus set</i>.


<a name="ProteinConsensus">
<h3>Protein Consensus Set</h3>

<p> Given a system of aligned and superposed chains, the <i>protein
consensus set</i> comprises the alignment columns of residues that meet
specified criteria based on both the residues in a column and the spatial
positions of their atoms.  In MOE's Protein Consensus, these criteria are
expressed in the following tests:

<ul>
<a name="ResTest">

<p><li> <i>Residue Identity Test.</i>

The percentage of residues identical to the most frequent residue in
the column (i.e. of the same amino acid name) must exceed (or must not
exceed) a specified threshold.  This test can be modified to require that
at least (or at most) a specified percent of the residues be identical to
the residue in the master chain.

<p><li> <i>Gap Test.</i>

The number of gaps in the column must be at most a specified maximum value.
This test can have the additional requirement that there be no gap in the
master chain.

<a name="MainTest">
<p><li> <i>Mainchain RMSD Test.</i>

The root mean squared distance (RMSD) of the backbone atoms (CA, C, N,
O) in the residues of the column, calculated  with respect to the average
position of the atoms, must be within specified bounds.

<a name="SideTest">
<p><li> <i>Sidechain RMSD Test.</i>

The root mean squared distance (RMSD) of the sidechain atoms in the residues
of the column, calculated with respect to the average position of the atoms,
must be within specified bounds.  This test is only meaningful if all
the residues in the column are identical (i.e. have the same sidechain
atoms).

</ul>

<p>
Any of the above tests can be applied or excluded.  A residue column
is included in the consensus set if it passes all the required tests.
For example, we can define the protein consensus set to be all columns where

<ul>
<li> at least 50% of the residues present in the column are identical,
<li> at most 90% of the residues present in the column are identical, and
<li> there are no more than two gaps.
</ul>

Then, for a system of 11 proteins, a column containing
seven ARG residues, two GLY, one SER, and one gap would
be included in the protein consensus set.

<p> The RMSD tests are performed on the atoms of the residues in an
alignment column.  Since one test applies to mainchain atoms and the other
to sidechain atoms, when both RMSD tests are used, a column can fail in one
test and still be included in the consensus set if it passes the other --
the only requirement for inclusion is that the residues contain at least
some atoms satisfying the specified criteria.

<p>
In the RMSD tests, the computed distances can be modified by atom
temperature factor.  The temperature factor describes the average
displacement by which an atom is likely to be removed from its reported
position.  This mean displacement can be added to the position of each atom
when calculating the RMSD.  The temperature factor <i>B</i> is related to
the mean displacement <i>u</i> of an atom by the Debye-Waller equation,

<p align=center><img src="procore/temperature.gif"></p>

<a name="WaterConsensus">
<h3>Water Consensus Set</h3>

<p>The <i>water consensus set</i> comprises all waters that appear in
the same region of space across a certain percentage of the input chains.
To identify which waters are to be included in the consensus set, the waters
in the system are first grouped by spatial proximity into <i>clusters</i>.
The spatial size of each cluster is dictated by a specified cluster radius.
Each cluster is then checked for the number of chains contributing waters
to the cluster.

<ul>

<p><li><i>Cluster Radius</i>:  Specifies the maximum distance between
any two waters in the same cluster.  The smaller the cluster radius, the
tighter the cluster.  The atom temperature factor can be included in the
calculations, in which case the position of each water molecule is modified
by the mean displacement of that water molecule.

<p><li><i>Water Site Contribution Test</i>:  For inclusion in the consensus
set, a cluster must have at least (or at most) the specified number of
chains contributing waters to it.  This test is always applied.

</ul>

<a name="Running"><h2>Running Protein Consensus</h2>

<p>To run a consensus calculation, perform the following steps:

<ol>
  <li>Load the protein chains into MOE.

  <p><li>Perform alignment and superposition using
<nobr><b>SE | Homology | Align</b></nobr> in the Sequence Editor
<nobr>(or <b>MOE | Compute | Biopolymer | Align</b>)</nobr>.

  <p><li>Open the Protein Consensus panel using
<b><nobr>SE | Homology | Consensus</nobr></b> (or <nobr><b>MOE |
Compute | Biopolymer | Consensus</b>)</nobr>.  This command is unavailable
if no molecular system is loaded in MOE.

<p>
<center>
<img src="procore/procon_panel.png" alt="Protein Consensus Panel">
</center>

<p><li>To build a consensus of only a subset of the chains in the system,
select them in the Sequence Editor and turn on <b>Calculate on Selected
Chains Only</b>.  If this option is off, the calculation will include all
protein chains in the system.

<p><li>Press <b>Calculate</b>.  At least two valid chains are required
for the calculation.  Chains containing no atoms or missing backbone atoms
are considered to be sequence-only; they will be omitted from the RMSD
calculations and dendrograms but included in all other calculations.
(A message will appear identifying the sequence-only chains if there are
any.)
Chains not entirely composed of amino acids are excluded.
Water chains associated (through a common tag)
with the valid protein chains are included in the calculations.

<p><LI>If desired, set the <b>Master Chain</b> (at the top of the panel).

<p><li>Set the criteria for the water and protein consensus sets to their
desired values.  The consensus sets are updated dynamically to reflect
the new thresholds.

</ol>

<a name="Specifying"></a>
<h3>Specifying the Consensus Criteria</h3>

<p>The consensus criteria are defined in the Water Consensus Definition and
Protein Consensus Definition sections of the panel.

<table cellspacing="10">
<tr><td valign="top"><b>Water Site Contribution</b>
<td valign="top">These sliders specify the minimum and maximum number of
chains which must contribute waters to an individual water cluster for the
cluster to be included in the consensus set.

<tr><td valign="top"><b>Cluster Radius</b>
<td valign="top">Specifies the maximum distance between any two waters in the
same cluster.  Waters farther apart than this distance are considered to
be in different clusters.  Press the <b>Apply</b> button to put a new value
of the cluster radius into effect (reclustering is not done automatically).

<tr><td valign="top"><b>Add B-Factor</b>
<td valign="top">If this option is on, the mean displacement of each water
is added when computing the distance between two waters for the purpose
of clustering.  This results in waters with low temperature factor (more
accurate position data) being preferentially conserved (waters with
high temperature factor will be excluded from clusters).

</table>


<p><table cellspacing="10">

<tr><td valign="top"><b>Allow Gaps</b>

<td valign="top">If this option is on, columns containing gaps will be
considered for inclusion in the consensus set.  The slider sets the maximum
number of gaps permitted in a column.  If this option is off, all columns
with gaps are excluded from the consensus set.

<p>If <b>Allow Gaps in Master</b> is on, columns where the master chain
has a gap are considered for inclusion in the consensus set.  Otherwise,
all such columns will be excluded.  This choice is available only when
<b>Allow Gaps</b> is on.

<tr><td valign="top"><b>Mainchain RMSD</b>
<td valign="top">If this option is on, the 
<a href="#MainTest">Mainchain RMSD Test</a> will be applied when building the consensus set.  Minimum and
maximum RMSD values are set with the sliders.

<tr><td valign="top"><b>Sidechain RMSD</b>
<td valign="top">If this option is on, the 
<a href="#SideTest">Sidechain RMSD Test</a> 
will be applied when building the consensus set.  Minimum and
maximum RMSD values are set with the sliders.  Sidechain atoms in a column
may enter the consensus set only if all residues contain the same sidechain
atoms (i.e. if the column has 100% residue identity and all sidechain
atoms are present).

<tr><td valign="top"><b>Residue Identity</b>

<td valign="top">If this option is on, the 
<a href="#ResTest">Residue Identity Test</a> 
will be applied when building the consensus set.

<p>When <b>Residue Identity to Master</b> is on, residue identity is
calculated as the percent of residues in the column which are identical to
the residue of the master chain in this position.  Otherwise, identity is
calculated as the percent of residues in the column which are identical to
the most frequent residue in the column.  The sliders specify the minimum
and maximum permitted values.

<p> If a column contains a gap, the calculation is performed over all
residues present, i.e. gaps are ignored.  If the master chain has a gap in
this column (and the column is admissible by <b>Allow Gaps in Master</b>),
the calculation is always with respect to the most frequent residue.

<tr><td valign="top"><b>Add B-Factor to RMSD</b>
<td valign="top"> If this option is on, the mean displacement of each atom is
added when computing distances in the mainchain and sidechain RMSD tests.
This results in increased RMSD values in the presence of atoms with
high temperature factor.

</table>

<a name="Recalculating">
<h3>Recalculating the Consensus Set</h3>

<p>The consensus set must be recalculated whenever the system changes,
e.g. after deleting or adding a chain or after moving atoms.
A warning of <b>Recalculation Suggested</b> will appear in the lower right
corner of the panel should any of these situations occur.

<p align=center>
<img src="procore/recalc.gif" alt="Recalculation Suggested">
</p>

<p> The system should also be recalculated, of course, when a different
set of chains is to be used for calculating the conserved core.
Press <b>Calculate</b> to recalculate the consensus set.


<a name="Analysis">
<h2>Analyzing the Results</h2>

<p> Once a consensus set has been calculated, it can be visualized in
both the MOE and Sequence Editor windows.  A report can also be obtained.
The consensus set is analyzed by the Protein Consensus application
for relationships between the input proteins.  The results of this
analysis are displayed as dendrograms in the Protein Consensus panel.

<a name="Visualizing">
<h3>Visualizing the Consensus Set</h3>

MOE's Protein Consensus offers a variety of visualization options for
the consensus set:

<ul>
<li> The backbones of the residues in (or not in) the consensus set
can be displayed in the MOE Window.

<li> The atoms in (or not in) the consensus set can be displayed
in the MOE Window.

<li> The residues in (or not in) the consensus set can be selected
in the Sequence Editor.

<li> The waters in the water consensus set can be displayed in the
MOE Window.

</ul>

<p> For example, the left image below shows a system of five protein chains
and their waters from the file <tt>$MOE/sample/mol/hiv_water.moe</tt>.
The right image shows the consensus set visualized as the conserved backbones
and waters of all chains, and the conserved atoms of the master chain.
The water cluster radius was set at 2.4, and the only criterion used for
building the protein consensus set was the Mainchain RMSD test, with a
maximum permitted RMSD of 0.7 angstroms.

<p align=center>
<img src="procore/hivall.gif">
<img src="procore/hivcon.gif">
</p>

<p>Pressing the <b>Visualize...</b> button at the bottom of the Protein
Consensus panel opens the Protein Consensus Visualization panel which
contains controls for visualizing the conserved core in the MOE Window
and the Sequence Editor.

<p align=center>
<img src="procore/vispanel.gif" alt="Protein Consensus Visualization">
</p>

<p>The <b>Visualize Protein Elements</b> option menu specifies whether it
is objects in the consensus set or not in the consensus set that are to
be visualized.  This option applies only to the protein consensus set as
waters not in the water consensus set cannot be visualized.

<p>The table of option menus is used to control the visualization of
backbones, residues, atoms, and waters in (or not in) the consensus set,
as follows.

<table cellspacing="10">
<tr><td valign="top"><b>Chains</b>
<td valign="top">Specifies which chains to visualize.
<ul>
<li><b>All</b>: All chains in the consensus calculation
<li><b>Master</b>: Only the master chain
<li><b>Selected</b>: Only the selected chains in the consensus calculation
<li><b>None</b>: No chains (hides the set of chains for which consensus
was calculated)
</ul>

<tr><td valign="top"><b>Render</b>
<td valign="top">Specifies how the objects determined by <b>Chains</b>
are to be rendered.

<ul>

<li>For <b>Backbone</b>: The rendering mode in the MOE Window
of the backbone ribbon for columns in
(or not in) the consensus set.

<li>For <b>Residue</b>: Whether to select residues in (not in) the consensus
set.  The selection is performed in the Sequence Editor.

<li>For <b>Atoms</b>: The rendering mode of atoms in (not in) the consensus set.

<li>For <b>Waters</b>: The rendering mode of waters in the water consensus set.

</ul>

<tr><td valign="top"><b>Color</b>
<td valign="top">Specifies how the objects determined by <b>Chains</b>
are to be colored.

<ul>

<li><b>Do Not Change</b>: Protein Consensus will not change the
color of the object.

<li><b>Chain Color</b> (for Backbones only): 
Color the backbone by the chain color.

<li><b>Sequence Variability</b> (for Backbones and Residues only):
Color by the variability of the residues
in the alignment column.  The variability is determined according
to Armon <i>et al.</i> [Armon 2001].  In this scheme, similar residues
contribute little to variability, and dissimilar residues contribute greatly.
For example, a glycine-tryptophan pair has about six
times more variability than
a glycine-serine pair.

<li><b>RMSD</b>: Color backbones and residues by the RMSD of all the
atoms belonging to the column.  Color atoms by the RMSD of
all corresponding atoms in the column.  Color waters by the RMSD
of the waters in the same cluster.

</ul>

<p> In the cases of Sequence Variability and RMSD, blue is low
variability/RMSD (cold) and red is high variability/RMSD (hot).  Note that
residue color cannot be seen in the Sequence Editor if the residues are
selected.

<tr><td valign="top"><B>Update</b>
<td valign="top"> Update the visualization of the objects in question.
When <b>Auto</b> is not on, the <b>Update</b> button must be pressed 
to visualize a new consensus set or if the visualization options are
changed.  <b>Update</b> will also restore the visualization if the rendering
has been changed outside of Protein Consensus.
For example, if one were to choose <b>MOE | Render | Backbone | None</b>,
the backbone would disappear.
Pressing the <b>Update</b> button of the Backbone row will restore
the visualization of the conserved backbone.

<b>Auto</b> is on.

<tr><td valign="top"><b>Update All</b>
<td valign="top">Equivalent to pressing all <b>Update</b> buttons.
</table>

<a name="Dendrograms">
<h3>Dendrograms</h3>

<p> Once the consensus set is calculated, MOE's Protein Consensus will
analyze the relationships between the input proteins according to the
following metrics:

<ul>
<li> the pairwise RMSD of mainchain atoms of all gapless columns
<li> the pairwise RMSD of mainchain atoms of all gapless columns
in the consensus set
<li> the pairwise sequential distance of all protein chains
<li> the pairwise sequential distance of all protein chains, considering
only subsequences in the consensus set
</ul>

<p> If there are three or more chains in the consensus set, the results
from using each metric can be displayed as a dendrogram.  The dendrograms are
computed using the Neighbor Joining method of Saitou and Nei [Saitou 1987].
In this method, the two nearest neighbors are joined in a cluster, where the
height of the horizontal 
connection is equal to the distance between them.  From this
point on, the cluster is treated as a single element.  The distance between
two clusters X and Y (or cluster X and a node Y) is the minimum of 
all distances
between nodes in X and nodes in Y.  In this manner, the dendrogram groups
together similar proteins, where the more distant the relationship, the higher
the connection.


<p>The dendrogram to be displayed is determined by the <b>Dendrogram</b>
option menu.

<p>The order of the nodes in the dendrogram will not necessarily coincide
with the order of the chains in the system.  To determine which node
corresponds to a particular chain, select the chain in the Sequence Editor.
Likewise, to determine which chains correspond to particular nodes, click
on or drag a selection box over the nodes.

<p>The <b>Reorder Chains</b> button will reorder the chains in the system to
match the order of the nodes in the dendrogram.  The master chain will be
automatically updated to reflect the new chain positions, and the dendrogram
will be updated as shown below.

<a name="Super"><h2>Superposing, Realigning, and Building a Consensus Model</h2>

<p>The consensus set can be used to re-superpose and re-align the input
protein chains, and to create a representation of the conserved core called
a <i>consensus model</i>.  A consensus model contains the sequence of the
master chain along with the atoms of the consensus set.
