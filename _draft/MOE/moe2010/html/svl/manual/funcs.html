<h2><a name="Scope">Scope</a></h2>

<p>Programs are made of functions. Functions are blocks of code that
perform certain operations and/or data manipulations. It is often
desirable to place limits on the visibility and lifetime of variables and
functions, for better control over their use. In programming parlance,
such limits are known as <i>scope</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>scope</i> of an object is the part of the program - the
<i>context</i>- in which the object is defined. We speak of function scope
and variable scope.  There are 3 classes of scope: <i>local, global
</i>and <i>file</i>. Local <i>variables</i> have local scope and exist
only within the function, the loop or the <tt>if-then-else</tt> branch in
which they are defined (these last are future extensions in development).
Local <i>functions</i> have file scope and exist only within the file in
which they are defined. Global objects have global scope and are visible
across program file boundaries. SVL built-in functions (Bifs) differ from
user-defined global functions in that Bifs are callable from anywhere
(i.e. do not have to be declared to be used) while user-defined
global functions must first be declared in a file before being called.</p>

<p>Functions defined to be <tt>local</tt> are not visible at the command
line. Global functions are. Functions may not be defined at the command
line. <b></p>

<p>Note:</b> Local variable scope will soon be enforced. You are strongly
advised to treat variables local to a given structure as invisible to the
outside world. We also recommended that you not declare local and global
variables having the same name.</p>

<h2><a name="Constants">Constants</a></h2>

<p>Constants can be defined anywhere, i.e. both outside of
functions and within functions, anywhere a statement is permitted. Once
defined, their values cannot be changed; i.e. constant class
objects are not lvalues, they cannot appear on the left-hand side of an
assignment. The value of a constant can be set to an expression; however,
the expression must be one that can be evaluated at compile time.</p>

<p>The <tt>const</tt> definition is made as follows: </p>

<pre>
    const <i>identifier</i> = <i>expr</i> [, ... <i>identifier</i> = <i>expr</i> ];
</pre>

<p>More than one constant can be defined in the same definition, using the comma
separator. For example, </p>

<pre>
    const a = 1, b = 2, c = 3;
</pre>

<p>Constants defined within a function have local scope and are invisible
outside the function. Constants defined outside a function have file scope
and are visible to all functions within that file following the constant
definition. There are no user-defined global constants. SVL has several
pre-defined <a href="svlfund.html">built-in constants</a> that are
globally visible.</p>

<h2><a name="Variables">Variables</a></h2>

<p>In general, within functions, variable declarations can appear wherever
a statement is permitted to appear, although not all classes are available
in all contexts. Variable declarations can also appear outside of
functions.</p>

<p>The place where a variable is declared and its storage class have an
impact on its use and on its scope. There are 3 classes of variables:
<tt>local</tt>, <tt>static</tt> and <tt>global</tt>.  </p>

<h3><a name="local Class"><tt>local</tt> Class</a></h3>

<p>Local class variables have a lifetime limited to the execution of the
function in which they are defined. Each function invocation is associated
with a fresh version of the local variable, with no memory of the
variable's value from previous invocations. Thus, in recursive function
calls, each recursion allocates a private version of each local variable
so that variable values in each call are unaffected by other calls. Local
variables cannot be declared outside of functions.</p>

<p>Variables in a <tt>local</tt> declaration can be optionally assigned a value at
declaration time: </p>

<pre>
    local <i>identifier</i> [= <i>expr</i>] [, ..., <i>identifier</i> [= <i>expr</i>] ] ;
</pre>

<p>Square brackets <tt>[]</tt> indicate optional assignment. It is permissible to declare
and assign values to a vector of local variables. </p>

<pre>
    local p=0, [ d, [e,f] ] = [ 2, [3,4] ];
</pre>
<b>

<p>Note:</b> Local variable scope inside loops and inside
<tt>if-then-else</tt> branches will soon be enforced. Use with
caution.</p>

<h3><a name="static Class"><tt>static</tt> Class</a></h3>

<p>A static class variable can be declared anywhere. It is
history-sensitive, and is allocated only once. As a consequence, statics,
unlike local variables, are not re-allocated in recursive function
calls.</p>

<p>Static variables declared within a function are only visible to that
function. Static variables declared outside a function are visible to all
functions defined within the same file, from the point of the static
variable declaration onward. In other words, functions defined before
where the variable is declared will not recognize the variable.</p>

<p>The two main uses of static variables are to permit history-sensitive
code and data sharing between functions in the same file. <b></p>

<p>Note:</b> Excessive use of statics for sharing data between functions
in the same file is fraught with peril: not knowing which functions modify
a given variable often leads to code difficult to read and to debug.</p>

<p>This is the <tt>static</tt> declaration syntax: </p>

<pre>
    static <i>identifier</i> [, ..., <i>identifier</i>] ;
</pre>

<p>Statics cannot be assigned values at declaration time. The initial value of a static is
null <tt>[]</tt>.</p>

<p>For example: </p>

<pre>
    static x;
    ...
    function do_something [a,b]
	local c, d;
	static y;
	y = a+b;
	...
	do_something [c,d];     // y preserved for next recursion
    endfunction
</pre>

<h3><a name="global Class"><tt>global</tt> Class</a></h3>

<p>Global class variables are used to share data between functions across
program file boundaries. They cannot be declared inside functions, and
they cannot be assigned values at declaration time. Be frugal: prodigal
use of global variables may result in hard-to-read and hard-to-debug
code.</p>

<p>Here is an example of a <tt>global</tt> declaration. </p>

<pre>
    global x, y, z;

    function somefunc []
	x = y = z = 1;
	...
    endfunction
</pre>

<p>The following table summarized the SVL variable classes:

<p><center>
<table BORDER="1" width="80%">

</table> </center>


<p>In this table, constants are included for sake of comparison. A &quot;may
be&quot; indicates that visibility depends on whether the declaration (or
definition, as in the case of constants) has been made inside or outside of
functions.</p>

<h2><a name="Functions">Functions</a></h2>

<p>A <i>function</i> is a piece of code that can be invoked by name. A
function's operands are passed to the function as an <i>argument</i>
vector, which immediately follows the function name when calling the
function. Groups of frequently used or specialized functions, collected
together, are known as <i>libraries</i>.</p>

<p>Functions break a long piece of code into smaller chunks. It is usually
good programming practice to make each function perform only one task, and
to build functions on top of other functions. This is called
<i>modular</i> programming, and allows implementation details of
lower-level tasks to be hidden from higher-level tasks. Thus, changes in
implementation can be localized and made transparently, that is, made in a
way invisible to other code.</p>

<h3><a name="Loading Functions">Loading Functions</a></h3>

<p>The command for loading a function from a file is <tt>load</tt>. The
formal syntax is: </p>

<pre>
    load <i>filename</i>;
</pre>

<p>where <i>filename</i>, a token, is the name of the file in which the
function is defined. The <tt>load</tt> command in fact loads all the
functions found in the specified file. A statement containing
<tt>load</tt> may appear in a function anywhere that a statement is
permitted to appear. <tt>load</tt> may also be used at the command-line
interpreter: </p>

<pre>
    svl&gt; load 'stats.svl'
</pre>

<h4><a name="Compilation Errors">Compilation Errors</a></h4>

<p>Before a function is successfully loaded, it must be successfully
compiled. Compilation may fail for various reasons, for instance, syntax
errors (see <a href="#Modules">modules</a>).  Compilation will also fail
when there are lines of code present which are not history-sensitive;
i.e. they contain none of the following: <tt>print</tt> or
<tt>pr</tt> statements, assignments or expressions involving random
numbers. Such history-insensitive statements, although legal, do not have
any effect, and merely waste computing time. The compiler will not permit
you to leave them in. </p>

<pre>
    add x;         // causes compiler error 
    rand 3;        // no error: random number generation
    print x;       // no error: print statement
    3 + pr x;      // no error: pr statement 
    [ x = 4, 3 ];  // causes compiler error, even though contains an
                   // assignment inside vector --- the vector being
                   // constructed has no effect 
</pre>

<h3><a name="Function Declaration">Function Declaration</a></h3>

<p>There are 3 types of function declaration, two of which include the
function definition, and one of which indicates that a function to be
called has been defined elsewhere, either lower down in the current file
or in another file.</p>

<p>In general, functions are defined as follows: </p>

<pre>
    [ local|global] function <i>identifier arg</i>
        <i>statement list</i>
    endfunction
</pre>

<p>If the <tt>local</tt> keyword is present, it indicates that the
function to be declared should only be visible in the current program
file. A local function can also be declared <i>within</i> another
function. Such a function is invisible to any other outside function. The
inner function shares all variables with the outer function that were
declared before the definition of the inner function, i.e. the
variables are treated as if they were globals.</p>

<p>The global keyword makes the declared function callable from outside
the current program file, i.e. it is a <i>public </i>function. If
the <tt>local</tt> keyword is not present, then the declared function is,
by default, <tt>global</tt>. It is strongly recommended, however, that
functions be explicitly declared as <tt>global</tt>. <i>arg</i> is the
function argument. If no parameters are passed, the function argument is
null <tt>[]</tt>.  The function declaration must end with the
<tt>endfunction</tt> keyword. </p>

<pre>
    global function mean x   // expect x scalar
        local len, sum;      // declare 2 local variables
        len = length x;
        if len == 0 then return 0; endif
        sum = add x; 
        return sum / len; 
    endfunction
</pre>

<p>Functions that comprise a single expression may be defined using a
shorthand function declaration. The syntax is: </p>

<pre>
    [local|global] function <i>identifier</i> arg = <i>expr</i> ;
</pre>

<p>The key features of this shorthand are the equals sign <tt>=</tt>, and
the absence of the <tt>endfunction</tt> keyword. The return value is the
value of the expression <i>expr</i>.  </p>

<pre>
    global function mean x =      // return null if x is null
        add x / last x_id x ;

    global function mean x =      // return 0 if x is null
        add x / ( length x + not length x ) ;
</pre>

<p>Calling a function that has not yet been defined, or is defined in
another file, requires a declaration of that function. If the function
source code is in another file, it must have been originally defined with
the <tt>global</tt> keyword.</p>

<p>The declaration </p>

<pre>
    function <i>identifier</i> [, <i>identifier</i>] ;
</pre>

<p>may be placed inside or outside a function, and indicates that the
functions named by the <i>identifier</i>s have not, up to this point, been
declared in the current file and must be imported. Several functions may
be declared on the same line, separated by commas.  Built-in functions are
auto-imported, and need not be declared.</p>

<p>When this declaration is found: 

<ul>
  <li>inside a function, it may be placed anywhere a statement may appear.
  The declared
    function is recognized only from the point of its declaration onward
    in the calling function. </li>

  <li>outside a function, it is recognized by all functions in the file
  whose definitions
    appear after its declaration.</li>

</ul>

<pre>
        // ExternalFunc invisible
        .
	.
	. 
    function ExternalFunc;    // now ExternalFunc visible 
    function BelowFunc;       // now BelowFunc visible

    function DoWhatsIt [a,b]
        .
	. 
        ExternalFunc a; 
        .
	. 
        BelowFunc [a,b]; 
        .
	. 
    endfunction


    function BelowFunc [m,n]  // ExternalFunc visible 
	.
	. 
        ExternalFunc m; 
	.
	. 
    endfunction
</pre>

<h3><a name="Arguments and Return Values">Arguments and Return Values</a></h3>

<p>All functions accept exactly one argument, a vector, and return exactly
one argument, a vector. (For more on function arguments see <a
href="svlfund.html">SVL Functions</a>.)</p>

<p>Arguments are always passed by value. In other words, only a private,
temporary copy of the arguments is manipulated by a function. After the
function has returned, the original arguments remain unaltered. To modify
actual argument values, the function must return new, updated values, and
these must then be explicitly assigned back to the originals. The
arguments, in this case, must be lvalues. For instance, </p>

<pre>
    global function Return_new_a_b_function [a,b]
        a = inc a;
        b = inc b;

        return [a,b];
    endfunction        // actual a,b unmodified

    [a,b] = Return_new_a_b_function [a,b];
</pre>

<p>Functions that do not take arguments must still be declared with an
argument, such as an empty vector; for example: </p>

<pre>
    function NoArgs [] ...
    endfunction 
</pre>

<p>Such a function is invoked with a null vector for argument. </p>

<pre>
    NoArgs [] ;
</pre>

<h4><a name="return Statement">return Statement</a></h4>

<p>The <tt>return</tt> statement causes a function, defined using the
<tt>function-endfunction</tt> declaration, to return a value (a vector) to
its caller. The syntax of the <tt>return</tt> statement is </p>

<pre>
    return <i>expr</i>;
</pre>

<p>where <i>expr</i> is an expression. If no return value is specified, null <tt>[]</tt>
is returned. In this case, executing </p>

<pre>
    endfunction
</pre>

<p>is equivalent to </p>

<pre>
    return [];
</pre>

<p>Similarly, if no <tt>return</tt> statement is present, <tt>[]</tt> is also returned.</p>

<p>A single-line function defined using the shorthand function definition
has an implicit <tt>return</tt> statement; the function returns the value
of the one-line expression.</p>

<h4><a name="Procedure vs. Function Calls">Procedure vs. Function Calls</a></h4>
<b>

<p></b>Functions can be made to exhibit different returning behaviors in
different calling contexts. In an assignment, for instance, a function's
return value is implicitly required. Sometimes, however, a function's
return value is not needed. In such a case, i.e. when a function
is called <i>procedurally</i>, it can be made to return null
<tt>[]</tt>.</p>

<p>(See the <a href="../fcnref/calletc.html"><tt>call</tt></a> function.)</p>

<p>A function that has a different behavior when called as a procedure
than when called as a function can be forced to return a value (behave as
a function) when otherwise it would return null. Forcing a return value is
achieved by enclosing the function call in parentheses <tt>()</tt>.</p>

<h3><a name="Passing Functions as Arguments">Passing Functions as Arguments</a></h3>

<p>To pass a function as an argument to another function, the caller
must specify either the <i>function name</i> as a token or the
<i>function address</i> as a number.  The function name must be the name
of a global function.  The function address must be the address of a
local function, which is declared on the top level, i.e. which is not
nested.  The address of a function is obtained by prefixing its
(unquoted) name with the symbol <tt>#</tt>.  For example,

<pre>
    local f = #my_fcn;
</pre>

assigns the address of the local function <tt>my_fcn</tt> to the variable
<tt>f</tt>.

<p>The function given by its name or address is subsequently invoked using
the function <tt>call</tt>. </p>

<pre>
    function xyz [ f, ... ]      // function f in argument
        ...
        v = call [ f, args ] ; 
        ...
    endfunction

    global function DoSomething [l,m,n] = ... ;

    function SomeFunc [...] // passes xyz a function name
        ...
        w = xyz [ 'DoSomething', [a,b,c] ] ;
        ...
    endfunction
</pre>

<p>Special care must be taken when the functions to be passed as
arguments are defined in run-module:

<pre>
    svl&gt; run 'module_name'
</pre>

<p>causes all functions in the module to be treated as <tt>local</tt>,
even if they were explicitly declared to be <tt>global</tt>.  If
functions defined in the run-module are to be passed as arguments to
other functions, they should be declared <tt>local</tt> and passed to
other functions by their addresses, not by their names.  </p>

<p>For more on using <tt>run</tt> see <a href="#RunFiles">Run Files</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="Function Extension">Function Extension</a></h3>

<p><a href="svlfund.html">Function extension</a> is a mechanism for
forcing a function to operate on each of the top-level elements of a
vector, and is effected using <tt>app</tt> or <tt>apt</tt>.</p>

<p>Here is an example of the use of <tt>app </tt>for applying a function
to a series of data. </p>

<pre>
    function f x = igen sqr x;

    svl&gt; app f [2,3]
    [ [1,2,3,4], [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] ]
    endfunction 
</pre>

<p>In the foregoing, </p>

<pre>
    app f [2,3] == [ f 2, f 3 ]
</pre>

<p>apt is similar to <tt>app</tt>, except that it additionally performs a transpose
operation on the arguments of the <tt>apt</tt>'ed function. In other words, </p>

<pre>
    apt f x
</pre>

<p>is equivalent to:</p>

<pre>
    app f tr x
</pre>

<p>This is useful for functions taking more than one parameter, and whose
parameters are passed in vectors.</p>

<h3><a name="Built-in versus Public Functions">Built-in versus Public Functions</a></h3>

<p>The functions that are distributed with your application software are classified as
belonging to either the application (e.g. <tt>MOE</tt>) or to SVL. The
application-specific functions are public functions. So are user-defined functions. SVL
functions are special as they are considered to be <i>built-in</i>. Built-in
functions (<i>bif</i>s) never need to be explicitly imported (they are
<i>auto-imports</i>). Some public functions can also be auto-imported. You can
interrogate functions for their auto-importability; see the next section for more details.
</p>

<h2><a name="Finding Public Symbols">Finding Public Symbols</a></h2>

<p>There are a host of tools for interrogating the system about public
symbols. For instance, with <tt>sym_find</tt> you can query for all
symbols (functions, global constants, global variables, and SVL built-in
functions) whose names match a given pattern. A set of related functions
allow you to look for only functions or global variables, for instance,
whose names match a given pattern. The value, type, size, and
auto-importability of a symbol can also be determined.</p>

<p>A useful set of cross-referencing tools allow you to find in which file
a function was defined (<tt>sym_file</tt>) and on which line in the file
(<tt>sym_line</tt>). You can also determine in which files a function is
used (<tt>sym_modules</tt>).</p>

<p>Finally, there are functions for listing out all public functions
(<tt>functions</tt>), global constants (<tt>constants)</tt> and global
variables (<tt>globals</tt>).</p>

<h2><a name="Modules">Modules</a></h2>

<p>In SVL, several functions can reside in one file. Generally, functions
that perform similar tasks are gathered in the same file. When such a file
is loaded using <tt>load</tt> (see <a href="#Loading Functions">loading
functions</a>), it is compiled into vector binary code called a
<i>module</i>. If compilation is successful, all the functions contained
in the module become resident in memory, and can be called at any time.
Compilation may fail for several reasons: syntax errors, constant
expression evaluation errors, presence of history-insensitive code (see <a
href="#Compilation Errors">compilation errors</a>), and name conflicts.
Name conflicts arise because 2 functions cannot share the same name,
unless the two instances are functions declared <tt>local</tt> in separate
files. Attempting to load a function when another function with the same
name is already resident will raise an error. The one conspicuous
exception is when re-loading a module:  if the module's <tt>title</tt>
(set using the <tt>#set title</tt> directive, see next section) is the
same as that of the currently-loaded module, the already existent
functions defined in that module will be replaced (the old module will be
unloaded and the new module loaded).</p>

<h3><a name="Module Environment">Module Environment</a></h3>

<p>The term <i>module environment</i> refers to optional settable
attributes of a given module, which are established by setting the module
environment variables. The syntax for setting an environment variable is
as follows: </p>

<pre>
    #set <i>environment_variable</i> '<i>value</i>'
</pre>
<i>

<p>environment_variable</i> is a token. You can set any arbitrary
environment variable.  The ones that are recognized by standard SVL are:


<p><ul>
  <li><tt>title</tt>, the name that appears (in windowing environments) in the
  SVL Modules &amp; Tasks window.</li>

  <li><tt>version</tt>, appended to the title in the SVL Modules &amp;
  Tasks window.</li>

  <li><tt>class</tt>, module classification; in the SVL Modules &amp;
  Tasks window, modules can be
    listed by module class on separate pages. When no class environment
    variable is set, the default class is <tt>'general'</tt>. </li>

  <li><tt>main</tt>, used to set the entry point of a module that will be
  executed on a <tt>run</tt> command. The default entry point is a function
    called <tt>main</tt>. </li>
</ul>


<p>For readability, module environment variables are generally set at the
very top of a file, before any code.</p>

<h3><a name="Obtaining Module Information">Obtaining Module Information</a></h3>

<p>Modules are assigned internal module keys by which they may be referenced
when inquiring for information about a module. Modules may also be referred
to by module title (set using the <tt>#set title</tt> directive) or by file
name.</p>

<p>The keys, titles, classes, and file names of modules can be found using
SVL's module information tools: <tt>mod_key</tt>, <tt>mod_title</tt>,
<tt>mod_class</tt>, <tt>mod_file</tt> and <tt>mod_find</tt>.
Cross-referencing tools allow you to ask the names of public functions and
global variables used in a given module.</p>

<p>The function <tt>modules</tt> lists all modules, and <tt>dumpmodules</tt> gives
detailed information on each.</p>

<h2><a name="Programs">Programs</a></h2>

<p>In a traditional programming environment the language source code files
are individually compiled into object modules.  Some objects are then linked
together to form a library of functions.  Other objects are linked with these
libraries, as well as with each other and with other system libraries, into a
binary executable file, which is then loaded and run at a later time.  When
libraries are specified to be "dynamic", they become independent of the
executable that uses them, allowing them to be shared among multiple
executables running at the same time.

<p>The SVL programming environment uses a similar but much simplified model
of execution:

<ul>
    <li>All SVL source code is compiled into "modules" that serve the
	function of both the (dynamic) libraries, and the executables of a
	traditional system.  (SVL does not use object files.)  SVL modules
	reside in memory; disk files are used only to store the source
	code.</li>

<p>
    <li>When the instructions from the compiled modules get to be executed,
	we refer to these execution streams as SVL programs or SVL tasks.
	There are multiple ways to cause execution of SVL code, which include
	typing commands in the CLI, listing expressions in a script file,
	specifying "main" function in a run-file, or associating SVL
	expressions with menu commands.</li>

<p>
    <li>SVL source files can be compiled using the <tt>load</tt> function
	into "library" modules that stay in memory until they are
	explicitly unloaded or re-loaded.  The library is formed of all
	non-local function defined in the file.  These functions can then be
	used by any SVL program.</li>

<p>
    <li>SVL expressions typed in the CLI are automatically
	compiled into an "executable" module which is immediately
	executed.  The module stays in memory only as long as necessary for
	its execution.  Typically, the SVL expressions involve functions
	defined in other, already loaded modules.</li>

<p>
    <li>A list of SVL expressions stored in a file can be compiled and
	immediately executed using the <tt>script</tt> function.  The
	expressions are executed as if typed in the CLI.</li>

<p>
    <li>A function specified in an SVL source file can be compiled and
	immediately executed using the <tt>run</tt> function.  The compiled
	module will not serve as a "library" module for other programs and
	will stay in the memory only as long as necessary for its
	execution.</li>

</ul>

<p>See <a href="adv.html">Advanced SVL Topics</a> for more on SVL tasks.</p>
<h3><a name="Scripts">Scripts</a></h3>

<p>A script is a sequence of SVL expressions stored in a file.
The expressions are executed as if typed in the CLI, with the exception
that the semi-colon at the end of each expression is no longer optional
and that all expressions are executed in one SVL task.

<p>For example, given the script file <tt>try.script</tt>:

<pre>
    //
    // try.script	- example of an SVL script 
    //
    x = igen 200 / 20 - 5;
    y = sqr sin x;
    PlotS [[x,y]];
</pre>

The CLI command

<pre>
    svl&gt; script 'try.script'
</pre>

is identical in effect to typing

<pre>
    x = igen 200 / 20 - 5;
    y = sqr sin x;
    PlotS [[x,y]];
</pre>

directly in the CLI.</p>

<h3><a name="RunFiles">Run Files</a></h3>

<p>The SVL <tt>run</tt> function starts an SVL program using as the
entry point a routine defined in a specified file.  The file is compiled in a
special mode that causes the module to be automatically unloaded when the
execution is finished.  All functions defined in the file are treated local
functions.

<p>A routine can be specified as the entry point of the program using the

<pre>
    #set <b>main</b> <em>function_name</em>
</pre>

<a href="#Module Environment">module environment</a> variable.  The


<pre>
    run 'programfile'
</pre>

<p>call entered at the CLI, where <tt>programfile</tt> is the name of the
file containing the module, causes the file to load, get executed, and then
unload.  The function designated as "<tt>main</tt>" automatically starts
executing as soon as the module has been successfully compiled. To pass
parameters to the function, use </p>

<pre>
    run ['programfile', arguments_to_main]
</pre>

<p>With the <tt>#set main</tt> directive in place, a module can still be
loaded using <tt>load</tt> and invoked in the usual way. </p>

<p>When the <tt>#set main</tt> variable is not present in a file, the
default entry point is a function called <tt>main</tt>. If such a function
does not exist in the file, an attempt to use <tt>run</tt> to execute the
module will result in an error.</p>


<h2><a name="Variables and Functions at the CLI">Variables and Functions at the CLI</a></h2>

<p>Constants, and static and local variables cannot be declared at the interactive command
line. By default, variables are global; their declaration is implicit. </p>

<pre>
    svl&gt; a = 6           // a is global 
    svl&gt; [b,c] = [3,4]   // b,c are globals 
    svl&gt; local a         // Error! 
</pre>

<p>The CLI is the one place that global variables may be assigned values
on first appearance. However, this is only when the global declaration is
<i>implicit</i>. We make this distinction because explicit declaration of
global variables is permitted. </p>

<pre>
    svl&gt; a = 1 // legal at CLI: no prior declaration of a
</pre>

<p>Function declarations and definitions, local or not, are not permitted at the CLI.
Function definitions must be loaded using <tt>load</tt>.
