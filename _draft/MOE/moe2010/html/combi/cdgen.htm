<h2>Enumerative Combinatorial Library Generation</h2>
<hr noshade="noshade" />

<p>
QuaSAR-CombiGen enumerates a virtual library of all possible products that
are combinatorially generated from a set of fragment molecules contained
in a scaffold database and a set of subsituent R-group databases.  The
virtual library is constructed by functionalizing central molecular
fragments called <i>scaffolds</i>.  Both monodentate and bidentate as
well as symmetric substitutions are supported, and substitution through
higher-order bonds is also allowed.
</p>

<p>
QuaSAR-CombiGen is opened using
<b><nobr>MOE | Compute | QuaSAR | QuaSAR-CombiGen</nobr></b> from the
MOE Window.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> MOE also
provides a non-enumerative (sampling)
method for combinatorial library generation in <a
href="../quasar/qcombi.htm">QuaSAR-CombiDesign</a>.

<a name="Methodology"></a>
<h2>Representation of Combinatorial Libraries</h2>
<p>
In MOE, a combinatorial library is specified by:
<p>
<ul>
  <li>A database of scaffold molecules or a single scaffold molecule
  <li>Databases of functional groups
  <li>Connection information specifying where the functional groups attach
on each scaffold
</ul>

<a name="AttachPoints"></a>
<h4>Attachment Points</h4>

<p>
A single combinatorial product is constructed by attaching <i>R-groups</i>
to a scaffold at marked <i>attachment points</i>, called <i>ports</i>.
The entire combinatorial library is enumerated by exhaustively cycling
through all combinations of R-groups at every attachment point on every
scaffold.  The virtual library is written to an output database.

<p>
Attachment points are terminal atoms named &quot;A<i>n</i>&quot;,
where <i>n</i> is a positive integer. In the QuaSAR-CombiGen panel,
<i>n</i> is limited to the range [0..9]. When using the SVL command
<tt>QuaSAR_CombiGen</tt>, however, <i>n</i> can be in the range [0..999].
If the terminal atom is attached to the main molecule by a higher-order bond,
substitution will be made through a bond of the same order.  Note that the
bond order at the scaffold attachment point must agree with that at the
R-group attachment point: either at least one of the bond orders must be 1
(single bond), or both must be of the same order.


<p>Fragment molecules are created by appropriately naming atoms at the desired
points of substitution.  You can use the <a
href="../moe/molsystems/build.html">Builder</a> to perform this
operation.  You can also use the <a href="cliprg.htm">Clip R-Groups</a>
application in a database to create fragments with named attachment points.

<p>Attachment points must be specified on both the R-group and the
scaffold molecule.

<a name="Scaffolds"></a>
<h4>Attachment Points on the Scaffold Molecule</h4>

<p>
The scaffold molecule has one or more specially marked atoms that
serve as attachment points for functional groups (R-groups).
</p>

<p>
<center>
<img src="cdgen/combi_scaff.png" alt="Scaffold attachment points" />
<br />
<i>Scaffold with named attachment point atoms</i>
</center>
</p>

<p>
A scaffold molecule can have any number of attachment points.  The
attachment points need not be uniquely named; if two ports have the same
name, they are functionalized simultaneously, resulting in a <i>symmetric
substitution</i>.
</p>

<a name="Fragments"></a>
<h4>Attachment Points on the R-Group Fragment Database</h4>

<div class="floatright">
<img src="cdgen/combi_rgroups.png" alt="Scaffold attachment points" />
</div>

<p>
Every R-group has either one or two atoms that are marked as a point of
attachment to the scaffold.  <i>Monodentate</i> R-groups attach onto a
scaffold through a single attachment point.  <i>Bidentate</i> R-groups
have two points of attachment to a scaffold.

<p>
<ul>
  <li>In a monodentate R-group database, the port name must be A0.
  <li>In a bidentate R-group database, the ports must be  named A0 and A1;
all molecules in the database must have the two ports defined.
</ul>

<p>
R-groups must contain exactly one A0 atom.  Bidentate R-groups
must further contain exactly one A1 atom.


<p>
The overall functionalization "reaction" is (in the monodentate case):

<blockquote>
<nobr>Scaffold-An + A0-R -> Scaffold-R</nobr>

<blockquote>
where <nobr>n = 0 to 9</nobr>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>That is, the marker atoms <i>An</i> (<i>n</i> is a digit) and
<i>A0</i> are eliminated.
</p>

<p>
The bidentate case is analogous.  In either case, the port atoms are
destroyed.
</p>

<p> <b>Note:</b> When bidentate R-groups are attached to a scaffold, there is
an attempt to line up the corresponding attachment points with each other.
This is achieved not only by rotating and translating the R-group, but also
by scaling it.  Consequently, the geometry of the R-group may be poor.
You can use <nobr><b>DBV | Compute | Molecule | Energy Minimize</b></nobr> in
a Database Viewer to obtain a lower energy conformation of the molecule.
</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> Any fragment with an A0 port can be used as a monodentate
R-group, and any fragment with both A0 and A1 ports can be used as a
bidentate R-group; i.e. R-group molecules can contain unused
ports.
</p>

<a name="MultiRes"></a>
<h4>Multi-Residue Fragments</h4>

<p>
Both the scaffold and the R-group may contain multiple chains and
multiple residues.

<a name="Running"></a>
<h2>Running QuaSAR-CombiGen</h2>

<ol>
<li>In the MOE Window, start QuaSAR-CombiGen by choosing
<nobr><b>MOE | Compute | QuaSAR | QuaSAR-CombiGen</b></nobr>. This opens the
QuaSAR-CombiGen panel:

<p><center><img src="cdgen/cdgen.png" alt="QuaSAR-CombiGen Panel"></center>


<p><li>In the <b>Output Database</b> field, enter the name of the database
that will contain the results.  This can be a new or an existing file.
If it already exists, it will be overwritten (you will be asked to confirm
the overwrite).

<p><li>To define the inputs, press the <b><nobr>Define and Edit
Connections</nobr></b> button to open the <nobr>Edit Connections</nobr> panel:

<p><center><img src="cdgen/define.png" alt="Edit Connections"></center>

<p>In the <b>Scaffold</b> section, select <b>MOE</b> to use just the molecule
in the <b>MOE Window</b>, or select the <b>Database</b> option and enter the
name of the database to use.

<p>To name the attachment points on a scaffold molecule, you can use the
<a href="../moe/molsystems/build.html">Builder</a>.
You can also use the <a href="cliprg.htm">Clip R-Groups</a>
application in a database to create fragments with named attachment points.

<p><b>Note</b>: Scaffold attachment points should usually be labeled in the
sequence A1, A2, etc., whereas R-group attachment points must be labeled
using A0 (for monodentate) or A0 &amp; A1 (for bidentate).

<p><li>Define the connection points between the scaffold(s) and the
R-groups by using the <b>Add Connection</b> button, once for each connection.

<p><li>Attachment points on the scaffold are associated with a database of
R-group molecules which are to be substituted at that point.

<ul>
<p><li>Monodentate R-groups have a single point of attachment to the
scaffold. To define the connection point on the scaffold, select the R-group
fragment database to associate with the connection point and press
<b>Add Connection</b>.  The port numbers are automatically assigned.
If you wish to change the port number, select the connection and
use the <b>Change Ports</b> buttons below the list.


<p><li>Bidentate R-groups have two points of attachment to the scaffold.
To assign the second port, select the connection in the list and then
choose the port using the <b>Bidentate</b> push buttons.

</ul>

<p><li>Not all defined ports need be used. Only connections in the selected set
will be used when the <b>Use Selected Entries Only</b> box is checked.

<p><li>Press <b>Error Report...</b> to open a text editor containing a report
on the currently defined connections.

<p><li>Press <b>OK</b> in the <nobr>Edit Connections</nobr> panel.

The QuaSAR-CombiGen panel now displays connection information in the
Connections area.  The scaffold port(s) and associated R-group
database name and connection type (monodentate or bidentate) are shown.

<p>The status line below the connections indicates the maximum number
of compounds that can be generated using the currently specified
scaffold(s) and R-groups.

<p><li>Press <b>OK</b> to generate the combinatorial library.
The virtual library is written to the output database in a molecule field
called <tt>mol</tt>.

<p><li>If the generated molecules contain unused ports, the output
database can be used without any additional processing as a scaffold
database in a subsequent combinatorial library generation operation.

</ol>

<p>A defined set of inputs might resemble the following:

<p><center><img src="cdgen/cdgen2.png" alt="QuaSAR-CombiGen Panel"></center>

<a name="Results"></a>
<h2>Interpreting the Results</h2>

<p>
MOE assigns each combinatorial product a unique molecule name which is composed
of the original names (if any) of the fragment molecules making up the final
molecule and the entry numbers of those fragments in their respective
databases, along with the name of the attachment points on the scaffold.  Thus,
the molecule name can be parsed to determine which fragments were combined to
produce a given product.

<p>
A scaffold molecule fragment is assigned a name of the following form:
<p>


<blockquote>
C<i>n</i>.<i>scaff_name</i>
</blockquote>

<p>where:
<ul>
<li><i>n</i> is the entry number of the scaffold in the scaffold
database (<i>n</i>=1 if using the currently loaded molecule in MOE)
<li><i>scaff_name</i> is the name, if any, of the original scaffold molecule
</ul>

<p>
Each R-group is assigned a name of the following form:

<blockquote>
<i>port</i>.<i>n</i>.<i>rgp_name</i>
</blockquote>

<p>where:
<ul>
<li><i>port</i> is the name of the attachment point on the scaffold
associated with the A0 port on the R-group (true for both monodentate and
bidentate R-groups)
<li><i>n</i> is the entry number of the R-group in the
R-group database
<li><i>rgp_name</i> is the name, if any, of the original
R-group molecule
</ul>

<p>
As each R-group fragment is substituted onto the scaffold, its name
is appended to the name of the partial product, separated by a "/"
character.  Here is an example of the name of a complete product:

<blockquote>
C2.benzene/A1.5.F/A2.3.N/A3.1.Cl
</blockquote>

<p>
The scaffold, named <tt>benzene</tt>, is the second entry in the scaffold
database.  Port A1 on the scaffold is substituted by the 5th entry, named
<tt>F</tt>, in the R-group database associated with that attachment
point.  Similarly, port A2 is substituted by the 3rd entry (named
<tt>N</tt>), and port A3 by the 1st entry (named <tt>Cl</tt>), of their
respective associated R-group databases.

<p>
Associated with each product is a flag indicating whether the product
was successfully generated.  A value of <tt>1</tt> indicates success;
a <tt>0</tt> indicates that there were errors in the input fragments,
e.g. missing ports.  The flags are written in a separate field named
<tt>$IS_CORRECT</tt>.

<a name="Errors"></a>
<h4>Validation Report</h4>

<p>

QuaSAR-CombiGen detects and produces a report of the errors in the input
molecular data.  Also reported are the total number of products generated,
as well as the number of correct products, i.e. products generated
from molecule fragments that contained no detected errors.  The error report
is sent to the SVL Commands window output area as well as optionally to
an SVL Text Editor.

<p>
The following are treated as errors:

<ul>
<li>Scaffold molecule missing any of the ports specified as an
attachment point for an R-group database

<li>Scaffold molecule having multiple instances of a port which has
been specified as an attachment point for a bidentate R-group

<li>Monodentate R-group having zero or more than one A0 port

<li>Bidentate R-group having zero or more than one A0 or A1 port

<li>Port atom which does not have exactly 1 bonded neighbor

<li>Molecule fragment comprising more than 1 residue

</ul>

<p>
When ports are missing or other errors are encountered, the output
product will be incorrect and may consist of solely the scaffold
or a partial product.  A field containing flags indicating whether the
product was successfully constructed is written to the output database.
