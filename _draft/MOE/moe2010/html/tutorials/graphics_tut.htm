<h4>MOE 2010.10</h4>
<h2>3D Visualization and Making Pictures</h2>
<hr noshade="noshade" />

<p>The communication of molecular modeling results relies on the production of
high-quality images for presentations and publications. MOE can create
publication quality images with options for adjusting the transparency, gloss,
and shading of different objects as well as options for custom lighting,
backgrounds, and effects such as focal blur and non-photorealistic rendering.
Different journals, web-pages and internal documents often require different
file formats and levels of resolution, therefore, control over these
specifications is a desirable feature of any molecular visualization system.
This tutorial covers some of the active site visualization and analysis tools
in MOE as well as advanced rendering options. Several publication quality
images (<a href="#pic">see below</a>) will be generated, the system will be
rendered using
<a href="../moe/gui/mainwin.htm#DisplayModes">Anaglyph Stereo 3D</a>, and a
green-magenta stereo <a href="#3d">3D image</a> will be produced.</p>
<p>The crystal structure of an activated Akt/protein kinase B (Akt/PKB) bound
to the GSK3 peptide as well as the AMP-PNP ligand will be used as an example.
Interactions with the AMP-PNP ligand will be visualized and analyzed by viewing
the non-bonded contacts, molecular surfaces, as well as a 2D Ligand Interaction
Diagram. Different regions such as the hinge, the P-loop, and the bound peptide
will be individually colored. All such visualizations will be saved to
publication quality image files. NB: Some of the advanced visualization tools
require <a href="../appendix/viewsetup.htm#RealTimeRayTracing">suitable
graphics cards and drivers.</a> If MOE has chosen <b>Ray Tracing</b> as the
option for <b>Quality</b> in the <b>Visualization Setup</b> panel
<b>(MOE | Render | Setup...)</b>, then such advanced graphics are supported.
</p>

<p>This tutorial has been broken down into the following steps:
<ul>
<li><a href="#I">Load, prepare, and visualize the active site of Akt/PKB in MOE
</a></li>
<li><a href="#II">Render and save a 3D picture focused on adenine</a></li>
<li><a href="#III">Generate and save a customized 2D Ligand Interaction Diagram
</a></li>
<li><a href="#IV">Color code the key kinase regions and add a surface of the
pocket</a></li>

<li>

<h3><a name="I">Load, prepare, and visualize the active site of Akt/PKB in MOE
</a></h3>

<p>Open the Akt/PKB complex present in MOE's sample directory:</p>

<blockquote><b>MOE | File | Open ...$MOE/sample/mol/1o6k.pdb</b></blockquote>

<p>
Choose <b>Load PDB File</b> on the right hand side of the <b>Open</b> panel and
click <b>OK</b> in the <b>Load PDB File </b>panel.
</p>

<p align="center">

</p>

<p>Delete the waters in the system:</p>
<blockquote><b>RHS | System | Solvent | x</b> ...click <b>OK</b> when prompted
to delete the 2 water chains</blockquote>

<p align="center">
<img src="graphics_tut/tapper.png" alt="Tapper">
</p>

<p>Place hydrogens and assign ionization states throughout the system:</p>
<blockquote><b>MOE | Compute | Protonate 3D</b></blockquote>
<p>Click <b>OK</b> in the <b>Protonate 3D</b> panel. <b>Protonate 3D</b>
[Labute 2008] will run an optimization routine to determine the overall lowest
potential energy configuration for all the different possible states of
terminal amides, hydroxyls, thiols, histidines, and titratable groups
throughout the system. When the calculation is finished, isolate the ligand and
pocket in 3D, then rotate the system as shown.</p>
<blockquote><b>RHS | SiteView</b></blockquote>

<p align="center">
<img src="graphics_tut/moe2.png" alt="SiteView">
</p>

<p>Notice the non-bonded contacts shown as dotted lines in 3D. Lines are drawn
for hydrogen bonds (including CH..X) as well as proton-π interactions. Any
interaction stronger than the default 0.5 kcal/mol cutoff is shown. The
non-bonded contacts can be managed with <b>(MOE | popup | Contacts)</b> and
this is demonstrated in the next section. It is good practice to save the
system to a MOE file.
<blockquote><b>MOE | File | Save</b> ...type 1o6k_prep.moe and click
<b>OK</b>.</blockquote>

</li>
<li>

<h3><a name="II">Render and save a 3D picture focused on adenine</a></h3>

<p>As molecular systems get large, the visualization should focus on the
portions of interest and uninteresting portions of the systems can be hidden
from view. Visualization parameters such as background lighting, font size,
default object colors, default object sizes and colors can be altered to obtain
a desired effect. Graphic effects such as focal blur, depth cuing and
z-clipping, and transparency may also be applied.</p>
<p>In this section, we will focus the view on the adenine portion of the ligand
and we will highlight the non-bonded contacts. If you have completed Step 1
above, render the ligand as in the image below.
<blockquote><b>RHS | System | Ligand | Ball and Stick</b></blockquote>

<p align="center">
<img src="graphics_tut/tapper_lig.png" alt="Tapper">
</p>

<p>Zoom in on the adenine as in the picture below. You can zoom with the scroll
wheel of a mouse of with the dial underneath the soccer ball at the bottom
right of the MOE window. Open the <b>Visualization Setup</b> panel.
<blockquote><b>MOE | Render | Setup...</b></blockquote>
<p>Change the <b>Theme</b> to <b>Standard White</b>. Color the hydrogen bonds
bright cyan by switching to the <b>Molecules and Ribbons</b> tab in the
<b>Visualization Setup</b> panel and changing the <b>H-Bonds</b> dropdown
button to bright cyan and color the proton-pi contacts bright green by changing
the <b>H-pi-Bonds</b> dropdown button to bright green.</p>
<p>The focal blur effect will blur out objects that are far behind as well as
in front of the focal plane in MOE. It is useful for drawing the eye to a
particular portion of interest, such as the adenine. To add the focal blur
effect, first middle click on the adenine nitrogen that interacts with the
protein backbone NH to set the focal point and define the focal plane. Then
switch to the <b>Effects & Text</b> tab in the <b>Visualization Setup</b> panel
and set the <b>Focal Blur</b> to <b>0.9</b>  and set the <b>Quality</b> to
<b>High</b>. Your MOE window should now resemble the picture below.</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="graphics_tut/pic1_blur.png" alt="Nice picture">
</p>

<p> To save a picture as above, click <b>Save Picture...</b> at the bottom of
the <b>Visualization Setup</b> panel. Indicate pic1.png as the file to save.
Ensure that the <b>pixel</b> dropdown is chosen next to the <b>Dimension</b>
box and enter 1500 x 1200. Click <b>Save</b> to save the picture (note the
<b>Resolution</b> of 300 dpi). It is also good practice to save a MOE file of
the current system to complement the picture in case any changes need to be
made. You may copy the current scene in MOE to the clipboard and paste the
image into other programs,
for instance, on Microsoft Windows, you can paste directly
into Microsoft Word or PowerPoint.
</p>

<p>
For this, open PowerPoint, for
example, and copy the MOE scene to the clipboard.</p>
<blockquote><b>MOE | Edit | Copy As | Picture</b></blockquote>
<p>In the <b>Copy Picture to Clipboard</b> panel, use the <b>Dimension</b>
dropdown box and set it to <b>PowerPoint</b> and click <b>OK</b>. Then paste
the clipboard contents onto a slide in PowerPoint using Paste | Special. The
image that appears will be the correct size for a full slide image.</p>
<p>All settings of the <b>Visualization Setup</b> panel can be stored in a
<b>Theme</b>, allowing each user to save their own look for MOE. Save the
modified <b>Visualization Setup</b> parameters as a new <b>Theme</b> by
clicking <b>New</b> in the <b>Visualization Setup</b> panel and enter Adenine
Focus as the <b>New Theme Name</b> and click <b>Save Theme</b>. You can load
predefined as well as custom themes and set them as the default setup by
clicking the <b>Use on Startup</b> button. Cycle through the predefined themes
by changing the <b>Theme:</b> dropdown to <b>Standard</b>, then
<b>Schematic</b>, then <b>Cover 2009</b>, then <b>Focus</b> and finally back to
<b>Adenine Focus</b>.</p>
<p>The <b>Contacts</b> demonstrate that the saturated Val166 sidechain
interacts with the adenine in addition to the hydrogen bonds to the hinge. To
get an idea of the strength of these interactions, display the underlying
numbers (in kcal/mol) for the <b>Contacts</b>.</p>
<blockquote><b>MOE | Popup | Contacts</b> &nbsp and click the <b>H-bonds</b>
button until it cycles to <b>2.1</b>. Cycle back to the original state before
continuing.</blockquote>
 
<p align="center">
<img src="graphics_tut/contacts.png" alt="Contacts">
</p>

<p>One can control the display state of the different types of contacts. To
turn off the intra-protein contacts, for example, click twice on the top left
cell of the <b>H Bond</b> Tic Tac Toe square in the <b>Contacts</b> widget.</p>
<blockquote><b>MOE | Popup | Contacts</b> &nbsp and click twice where shown
below so that the button appears gray</blockquote>
 
<p align="center">
<img src="graphics_tut/contacts2.png" alt="Contacts">
</p>

<p>When the button is gray, the intra-protein interactions will no longer be
displayed in MOE. If it is yellow, then the interactions are displayed with
thin dashed lines, and when green, cylinders are added to the dashed lines to
indicate the strength of the interactions. The display of VDW clashes in the
system are controlled by a similar manner in the <b>Clash</b> section of the
<b>Contacts</b> widget. You should toggle the <b>Contacts</b> features back to
their original state before continuing.</p>

<h3><a name="III">Generate and save a customized 2D Ligand Interaction
Diagram</a></h3>

<p>In this section, we will calculate a 2D Ligand Interaction Diagram to
clearly see the protein ligand interactions in the system. The diagram will be
customized and saved in high quality to different formats. Note that you must
have completed Step 1 and/or Step 2 above before proceeding. Compute the
diagram:<p>
<blockquote><b>RHS | Ligand | Ligand Interactions... &nbsp&nbsp OR &nbsp&nbsp
MOE | Compute | Ligand Interactions</b></blockquote>
<p>The default diagram will appear in the <b>Ligand Interactions</b> panel. You
may increase the size of the diagram by resizing the window.</p>
 
<p align="center">
<img src="graphics_tut/diag_panel.png" alt="Ligand Interactions panel">
</p>

<p>Open the <b>Sequence Editor</b> and select chain 1. Change the
<b>Receptor</b> dropdown of the <b>Ligand Interactions</b> panel to <b>Selected
Chains</b> and click <b>Apply</b>. This will eliminate the peptide residues and
the metals from the diagram, as we are interested in protein-ligand
interactions.</p>
<p>Change the <b>Legend</b> dropdown to <b>Rendering Options</b> and change the
<b>Residue Size</b> to 1.8 and click <b>Apply</b>. You may also rotate the
diagram by entering an angle in the <b>Rotation</b> box. Your diagram should
now appear similar to that in the image below.</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="graphics_tut/2d_diag.png" alt="2D diagram">
</p>

<p>To save this image, click <b>Export...</b> in the <b>Ligand Interactions</b>
panel. Type 2d_diagram.png as the <b>Filename</b> and change the <b>Width</b>
and <b>Height</b> to 750 and 600, respectively (as done for the image above),
and click <b>OK</b>. You may also copy the image to the clipboard and paste it
into Microsoft Word or PowerPoint
by clicking <b>Copy EMF</b> and pasting into either
program. You may close the <b>Ligand Interactions</b> panel when finished.</p> 

</li>
<li>

<h3><a name="IV">Color code the key kinase regions and add a surface of the
pocket</a></h3>

<p>Complex molecular systems such as protein-ligand complexes and
multiple-ligand overlays often require intricate rendering styles in order to
clearly highlight the regions of interest. Proteins are often drawn as ribbons,
while ligand atoms, pocket residues and metals are rendered and colored in a
number of ways that help clarify the image and help communicate the scientific
message. In this section, we will color code the atoms, ribbons, surfaces of
the kinase hinge, P-loop, and the bound peptide. Note that you must have
completed Step 1 and/or Step 2 above before proceeding. Open the
<b>Visualization Setup</b> panel.</p>
<blockquote><b>MOE | Render | Setup...</b></blockquote>
<p>Change the <b>Theme</b> to <b>Cover 2009</b>. We will first hide the protein
atoms and display the backbone ribbon.</p>
<blockquote><b>RHS | Hide | Receptor</b></blockquote>
<blockquote><b>MOE-popup | Ribbon | Cartoon</b></blockquote>
<blockquote><b>MOE-popup | Ribbon | Color | Residue</b></blockquote>

<p align="center">
<img src="graphics_tut/rib_cart.png" alt="rib_cart">
</p>

<p>This will color the ribbons by the residue color -they should be black at
the moment. To color the ribbons white, open the <b>Sequence Editor</b>,
right-click on chain 1 and apply:</p>
<blockquote/><b>SE | Chain popup | Ribbon | White</b></blockquote>
<p>This colors the ribbons of the protein white, and since they are
independently controlled, the atoms in the <b>3D MOE Window</b> will not be
affected. The ribbon for the peptide backbone should still be black. Toggle on
the display of the residue UIDs.</p>
<blockquote><b>SE | Display | Residue UID</b></blockquote>
<p>To select the glycine rich region (P-loop), clear the residue selection by 
clicking anywhere in the gray area of the <b>Sequence Editor</b> and select
Gly159 (UID 159) and then hold Shift and select Val166. Color the selected
residues gold by right-clicking in the blank gray area of the <b>Sequence
Editor</b> to bring up the <b>Selected Residues</b> popup and apply:</p>
<blockquote><b>SE | Selected Residues popup | Color | Gold</b> ...see the color
below</blockquote>

<p align="center">
<img src="graphics_tut/sel_res.png" alt="sel_res">
</p>

<p>Show the atoms of the selected residues and render them in stick, and color
their carbons and ribbons gold.</p>
<blockquote><b>SE | Selected Residues popup | Show | Atoms</b></blockquote>
<blockquote><b>SE | Selected Residues popup | Atoms | Stick</b></blockquote>
<blockquote><b>SE | Selected Residues popup | Atoms | Color C | 
Gold</b></blockquote>

<p align="center">
<img src="graphics_tut/sel_resa.png" alt="sel_resa">
</p>

<blockquote><b>SE | Selected Residues popup | Ribbon | Gold</b></blockquote>

<p>Your system should appear as below:</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="graphics_tut/gold_image.png" alt="Gold">
</p>

<p>Clear the residue selection in the <b>Sequence Editor</b> -notice the gold
color of the P-loop residues. Select the hinge region (Glu 230 – Glu 236) then
color the selected residues dark green by right-clicking in the blank area of
the <b>Sequence Editor</b> and applying:<p>
<blockquote><b>SE | Selected Residues popup | Color | Dark Green</b> ...see the
color below</blockquote>

<p align="center">
<img src="graphics_tut/seq_cols3.png" alt="green">
</p>

<p>Show the atoms of the selected residues, render them in stick mode, color
their carbons and ribbons dark green.</p>
<blockquote><b>SE | Selected Residues popup | Show | Atoms</b></blockquote>
<blockquote><b>SE | Selected Residues popup | Atoms | Stick</b></blockquote>
<blockquote><b>SE | Selected Residues popup | Atoms | Color C | Dark
Green</b></blockquote>
<blockquote><b>SE | Selected Residues popup | Ribbon | Dark 
Green</b></blockquote>

<p>To color the peptide purple, clear the residue selection and right-click on
chain 2 and apply:</p>
<blockquote><b>SE | Chain popup | Residues | Color | Purple</b> ...see color
below.</blockquote>

<p align="center">
<img src="graphics_tut/seq_cols4.png" alt="Purple">
</p>

<p>Show the atoms of the peptide chain, render them in stick mode, and color
their carbons and  ribbons purple.</p>
<blockquote><b>SE | Chain popup | Show | Atoms</b></blockquote>
<blockquote><b>SE | Chain popup | Atoms | Stick</b></blockquote>
<blockquote><b>SE | Chain popup | Atoms | Color C | Purple</b></blockquote>
<blockquote><b>SE | Chain popup | Ribbon | Purple</b></blockquote>

<p>Your system should appear as below:</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="graphics_tut/show_atoms.png" alt="shown atoms">
</p>

<p>Show the two ligating manganese atoms. Then, to hide the atoms that are far
away from the ligand, we will select the ligand and nearby atoms and hide the
unselected atoms as well as the nonpolar hydrogens.</p>
<blockquote><b>MOE | Selection | Element | Metal</b></blockquote>
<blockquote><b>RHS | Show | Selected</b></blockquote>
<blockquote><b>RHS | Select | Ligand</b></blockquote>
<blockquote><b>RHS | Extend | Near Residues</b></blockquote>
<blockquote><b>RHS | Hide | Unselected</b></blockquote>
<blockquote><b>RHS | Hydrogens</b>  ...click <b>Hydrogens</b> three times to
show polar hydrogens only. Then clear the atom selection.</blockquote>

<p>Molecular surfaces are useful for highlighting interfaces (e.g., binding
pockets in proteins) while property maps can be used to help determine the
characteristics of different regions of the system. Create a VDW Interaction
surface of the pocket.
 
<blockquote><b>RHS | Surface | Interaction (VDW)</b></blockquote>

<p align="center">
<img src="graphics_tut/surf_atom_col.png" alt="Rendered interaction pocket">
</p>
 
<p>The Interaction surface shows the contour where the VDW clash energy is
zero. Notice how the ligand is tightly wedged in the grid, avoiding clashes.
The manganese atoms are part of the receptor set and you can see their large
VDW radii. The next step is to draw a surface of the pocket help visualize the
contour as well as the properties of the binding pocket. Open the <b>Surfaces
and Maps</b> panel.</p>

<blockquote><b>MOE | Compute | Surfaces and Maps... &nbsp&nbsp OR &nbsp&nbsp
 RHS | Surface | Surfaces and Maps...</b></blockquote>

<p>Select the current Interaction Surface and click <b>Toggle</b> to hide it.
Then select chain 1 in the <b>Sequence Editor</b> and, in the <b>Surfaces and
Maps</b> panel, change the <b>Surface</b> type to <b>Molecular Surface</b>,
change the <b>Atoms</b> dropdown to <b>Selected Chains</b>, change the
<b>Near</b> dropdown to <b>Ligand Atoms</b>, change the <b>Color</b> dropdown
to <b>Atom Color</b>, change the rendering mode dropdown under the <b>Color</b>
dropdown to <b>Solid</b>, and click <b>Create</b>. The atoms of this pocket
surface are colored by the neighboring receptor <b>Atom Color</b>. In addition,
lone pair (hydrogen bond acceptors) are colored cyan and polar hydrogens, such
as hydrogen bond donors, are white. Non-polar hydrogens are ignored and the
surface inherits the color of the underlying carbon. You should see green and
gold parts of the surface corresponding to carbons of the hinge and P-loop,
respectively. Make use of the surface Z-clipping to get a better view of the
pocket.</p>
<blockquote><b>MOE | Footer | ZClip</b> ...slide the <b>SF</b> slider up. Your
system should appear similar to that below</blockquote>

<p align="center">
<img src="graphics_tut/surf_atom_col2.png" alt="Rendered atom color pocket">
</p>

<p>To color the surface gray, choose <b>Constant</b> in the <b>Color</b>
dropdown menu of the <b>Surfaces and Maps</b> panel. As shown below, change the
<b>Surface Color</b> to dark gray, click <b>Apply</b>, and adjust the
transparency of the surface using the two front and back transparency
sliders.</p>
 
<p align="center">
<img src="graphics_tut/sm_widg.png" alt="surface widget">
</p>

<p>If you want the picture to appear brighter, you may add a third light to the
scene. For this, switch to the <b>Light & Material</b> tab of the
<b>Visualization Setup</b> panel, click the <b>Light 3</b> button, change its
<b>Color</b> to white and use the soccer ball to place it where you wish.</p>
<p>You may also adjust the transparency of the ribbons. For this, in the
<b>Light & Material</b> tab of the <b>Visualization Setup</b> panel, click the
<b>Ribbon</b> dropdown under <b>Materials</b> and adjust the transparency
<b>T</b> slider to your liking. The <b>Cover 2009</b> theme uses flat shaded
carbons. Make the carbons shine as do the heteroatoms by toggling on the
<b>Link Carbon to Atom Material</b> checkbox.</p>
<p>To tweak the background colors as done for the image below, switch to the
<b>Background</b> tab of the <b>Visualization Setup</b> panel and change the
<b>Center</b> color to white. Then, for <b>Border</b>, open the color widget
and choose a darker blue and click <b>OK</b> as shown below.</p>
 
<p align="center">
<img src="graphics_tut/color_widget.png" alt="color widget">
</p>

<p>It is also possible to increase the size and change the color of the text
labels. For this, switch to the <b>Effects & Text</b> tab of the
<b>Visualization Setup</b> panel, adjust the <b>Text Size (A)</b> slider and
choose a new <b>Text Color</b> -black is appropriate. Your MOE Window should
now resemble the picture below. You may need to zoom in, rotate and make use of
the surface Z-clipping to get a better view of the pocket.</p>
<blockquote><b>MOE | Footer | ZClip</b> ...slide the <b>SF</b> slider

<p>To save a picture as above, click <b>Save Picture...</b> in the
<b>Visualization Setup</b> panel. Indicate pic2.png as the file to save. Enter
750 x 400 in the <b>Dimension</b> text box and ensure that its dropdown is set
to <b>pixel</b>. Click <b>Save</b> to save the picture (note the
<b>Resolution</b> of 300 dpi). Feel free to save the current <b>Theme</b> by
clicking <b>New</b> in <b>Visualization Setup</b> panel and entering a new
name. It is also good practice to save a MOE file of the current system to
complement the picture and theme in case any changes need to be made.</p>

<p>MOE has the ability to operate in various stereo modes including anaglyph
3D. Put on the MOE green-magenta anaglyph glasses that accompany the MOE
2010.10 CD and admire the picture below. You should see the atoms of the
peptide pop out in front of the ligand and you should see the adenine in its
true depth behind the plane where the manganese atoms lie. Then go to the MOE
<b>Visualization Setup</b> panel and change the <b>Theme</b> to <b>Anaglyph
Stereo</b> and turn on green-magenta anaglyph stereo:</p>
<blockquote><b>MOE | Render | Stereo | Green-Magenta</b></blockquote>
<p>Take some time to view the system in 3D and rotate/zoom as in the picture
below. Middle-click on any ligand atom to adjust the plane of origin for the 3D
effect.</p>
