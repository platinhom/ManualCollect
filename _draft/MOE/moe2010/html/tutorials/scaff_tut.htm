<h2>Scaffold Replacement Tutorial</h2>
<hr noshade="noshade" />

<p>
This tutorial will guide you in performing scaffold replacement
using the dedicated Scaffold Replacement application in MOE. As an 
example, we will use Factor Xa complexed with an inhibitor (PDB code 
<tt>1IOE</tt> from <tt>$MOE/sample/mol/1ioe.pdb</tt>).</p>

<h3>Conventions Used in this Tutorial</h3>

<table border="0" cellpadding="3">
<tr><td bgcolor="#cccccc">MOE</td><td>The MOE Window</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="#cccccc">DBV</td><td>A Database Viewer</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
In this tutorial, we will assume that you are using a three-button mouse.
For information on using a two-button mouse see
<a href="../moe/gui/mouse.html">Using the Mouse</a>.</p>

<h3>Preparing the System</h3>

<ol start="1">
<li><p><i>Prepare the Factor Xa structure.</i></p>
<p>First clear the system:</p>
<blockquote><span class="menu"> MOE | RHS | Close</span></blockquote>

<p>Open the PDB file:</p>
<blockquote><span class="menu">
MOE | RHS | Open | <tt>$MOE/sample/mol/1ioe.pdb</tt>
</span></blockquote>

<p>This will bring up the <b>Load PDB File</b> panel. Keep the default options
and press <b>OK</b>.</p>

<p>Display only the ligand and active site atoms:</p>

<blockquote><span class="menu"> MOE | RHS | SiteView </span></blockquote>

<p>The molecules from the PDB file have no hydrogens. 
LigX uses <a href="../apps/protonate3d.htm">Protonate3D</a> to set
reasonable ionization states and to place hydrogen atoms for the
molecular system.   It then refines the structure using energy minimization
to relax strain.</p>

<blockquote><span class="menu"> MOE | RHS | LigX</span></blockquote>

<p><img src="scaff_tut/ligx.png" alt="LigX" /></p>

<p>Keep the default options and press <b>OK</b>.  This will take a minute or so
to complete.  Progress reports are written to the MOE window.  The messages
disappear when the calculation is done.</p>

</li>

<li><i>Draw a molecular surface around the binding site.</i><br />
<p>Open Surfaces and Maps:</p>
<blockquote><span class="menu">MOE | Compute | Surfaces and Maps
</span></blockquote>

<p>Click <b>Create</b> to draw a surface around the receptor atoms
near the ligand atoms. The default viewpoint is from the other
side of the protein to the active site.  Click the middle mouse
button and drag the mouse to rotate the viewpoint
so that you can see the ligand.</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="scaff_tut/scaff1.png" alt="Active site" /></p>

<p>The surface is colored by the color of the nearest 
heavy atom.  Additionally, the 
<span class="menu">Overlay H-bond Information</span> option
colors the surface in the optimum regions where the
geometry would be optimal for a hydrogen bond acceptor (cyan)
or hydrogen bond donor (white).</p>
</li>

<li><i>Analyze the binding site.</i><br />
In the <span class="menu">Surfaces and Maps</span> panel, set the <b>Surface</b> to
<span class="menu">Electrostatic Map</span> and click <b>Create</b>.
These electrostatic maps, calculated from the receptor atoms, display the
preferred locations for hydrophobic entities as well as hydrogen bond donors
and acceptors (for a potential ligand):

<p align="center">
<img src="scaff_tut/scaff_pbmap.png" alt="Electrostatic map" /></p>

<p><span class="tip"><b>Tip:</b></span>
If you do not see preference maps for donor and acceptor regions, 
check that partial charges have been calculated for the atoms in
your system using <span class="menu">
MOE | Window | Atom Manager</span>.  To calculate partial charges, use 
<a href="../moe/pot.htm#Charge">Partial Charges</a>,
<a href="../apps/ligx.htm">LigX</a> or
<a href="../apps/protonate3d.htm">Protonate3D</a>.</p>
</li>

<li><p><i>Compare the molecular surface and electrostatic maps.</i></p>

<p>It can be difficult to view both electrostatic maps and a molecular 
surface at once. These are some solutions to this problem:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Show and hide surfaces or maps, using the controls at the top of the
<span class="menu">Surfaces and Maps</span> panel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With a deep binding pocket, it helps to increase the transparency of
the surface, in particular the back face of the surface.</p></li>

<li>With the <span class="menu">MOE | Footer | ZClip</span> controls,
Z-clipping can be applied to only the graphic objects, such as
surfaces and maps, using the <b>SF</b> and <b>SW</b> sliders.
These do not affect the display of atoms and ribbons.</li>
</ul>

<p>Select <tt>1IOE Receptor</tt> in the list of surfaces and click <b>Hide</b>.
</p>

<p>
Rotate the ligand and view the electrostatic map from different angles. 
Notice how the hydrophobic maps (white) superpose nicely with the napthyl
group and the 4-amino pyridyl groups of the ligand. The overlap of the
hydrophobic maps and these two R-groups and the poor overlap with the rest
of the ligand suggests that we perform a scaffold replacement
that will retain these two R-groups but will replace the remaining
portion (scaffold) of the ligand</p>

<p>
Also, take note of the preference for a hydrogen bond acceptor (red) near
the carbonyl oxygen on the scaffold of the ligand. Later in this tutorial
we will use a pharmacophore query filter to ensure that new scaffolds also
have this feature.</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="scaff_tut/electrostaticmap.png" alt="Electrostatic Maps" /></p>

<p>Hold the <b>Shift</b> key, additionally select 
<tt>1IOE Electrostatic Map</tt> and press <b>Toggle</b>.  This hides surfaces 
and maps which were visible, and shows them if they were hidden.</p>
<p>Click the <b>Show</b> button to show both the surface and the 
electrostatic maps.
</p>

<p>Select only <tt>1IOE Receptor</tt> in the list of surfaces and adjust the
vertical sliders at the bottom of the panel.  These adjust the
transparency of the front (left) and back (right) faces of the
surface.  Adjust the front face transparency to ~25% and the
back face transparency to ~75% transparent (zero is at the bottom).  The panel
should look like this:</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="scaff_tut/surfmap.png" alt="Surfaces and Maps" /></p>

<p>Select only <tt>1IOE Electrostatic Map</tt> in the list of surfaces and 
deselect the <b>Don</b> checkbox. This hides the electrostatic map for the
hydrogen bond donor probe.</p>

<p>From <span class="menu">MOE | Footer | ZClip</span> adjust the
<b>SW</b> slider to clip the front half of the surfaces and maps.</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="scaff_tut/zclip.png" alt="Z Clipping Graphic Objects" /></p>

<p>Click <b>Hide</b> to hide all of the electrostatic maps and 
close the <b>Surfaces and Maps</b> panel.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Performing a Scaffold Replacement Search</h3>

<p>Special Link pharmacophore query features are used for Scaffold Replacement. 
There are three types of Link features:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Link</b> annotates a heavy atom substitution point with at least one 
(implicit) hydrogen.</li>
<li><b>Link2</b> annotates projected locations of potential 
<i>sp</i><sup>2</sup> R-groups.</li>
<li><b>Link3</b> annotates projected locations of potential 
<i>sp</i><sup>3</sup> R-groups.</li>
</ul>

<p>
It is possible to use the <span class="menu">Pharmacophore Query Editor</span>
to manually construct a query and perform a search with one or more linker 
libraries.  Molecular surgery would have to be done by hand to remove the 
scaffold being replaced and to join the remaining ligand atoms (R-groups) for 
each linker hit.</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="../apps/ph4_annot/link_query.png" alt="Link features" /></p>

<p>The <a href="../apps/scaffold.htm">Scaffold Replacement</a> application
was designed to simplify this process.  The user must only select the atoms
or bonds defining the scaffold and R-groups, and MOE will generate queries,
perform the search and construct new structures from each hit.</p>

<p>
The application can be run in six different operating modes:</p>

<table class="titlebar" align="center">
<tr>
<th>Mode</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">Replace Scaffold (Select Scaffold)</td>
<td>Replace an internal portion of a molecule</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">Replace Scaffold (Select R Atoms)</td>
<td>Replace an internal portion of a molecule</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">Link Multiple Fragments</td>
<td>Find a scaffold that can link all specified fragments</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">Add Group to Ligand</td>
<td>Add a new fragment to a molecule</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">MedChem Transformations</td>
<td>Apply Medicinal Chemistry transformation rules to a molecule</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">BREED</td>
<td>Generate novel structures combining parts of existing aligned ligands</td>
</tr>
</table>

<ol start="1">
<li><i>Start Scaffold Replacement.</i>
<p class="indent_novspace">
<span class="menu">
MOE | Compute | Fragments | Scaffold Replacement...</span></p>

<p align="center">
<img src="scaff_tut/scaffrep_panel.png" alt="Scaffold Replacement panel" /></p>

<p>
Notice that because we have a protein-ligand complex loaded into MOE, the 
Ligand and Receptor options are automatically set to Ligand Atoms and 
Receptor Atoms.  You can check this using the <b>?</b> buttons, which 
will cause the atoms to be briefly highlighted in the main MOE window.</p>

<p>
As we are starting from a complete ligand, either of the first two modes 
could be used.  When using <b>Replace Scaffold (Select Scaffold)</b>, all
the atoms that you wish to replace must be selected.  When using
<b>Replace Scaffold (Select R Atoms)</b>, the first atom in each of the
R-groups that are linked to the scaffold must be selected.  In this example
we will use the second mode, so choose that from the <b>Operation</b> menu
in the Scaffold Replacement panel:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="scaff_tut/selectratoms.png"
alt="Choose Select R Atoms" /></p>

</li>

<li><p><i>Define the R-groups.</i></p>
<p>Deselect all atoms in MOE, and then select the carbon of the chloro-naphthyl 
group, which is bonded to the sulphonamide.</p>

<p>
Now, whilst holding down the <b>Shift</b> key, select the 4-carbon of the
pyridine group at the other end of the molecule.  You will see that the
atoms between this atom and the chloro-naphthyl group are highlighted in green;
these are the scaffold that will be replaced.  The bonds between the scaffold
and the R-groups are annotated with green arrows.</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="scaff_tut/rgrp.png" alt="Select the root atoms of the R groups" /></p>

<p>
In the <span class="menu">Scaffold Replacement</span> panel, green text 
reports of the number of leaving atoms (21) and the number of exit vectors 
(2, one for each R group).
Selections that are incompatible with the current <b>Operation</b> are
indicated in red, with red warning messages in the panel.</p>

<p>Output molecules are subject to a set of filters; by default a set of three 
descriptors are applied: molecular weight, SlogP and TPSA, though any 
combination of MOE descriptors, a <a href="../quasar/model.htm">QuaSAR-Model</a>
file or a pharmacophore query filter can be used.</p></li>

<li><p><i>Perform the search.</i></p>
<p>Select the <b>Open Database Viewer</b> box in the Output Database section of
the Scaffold Replacement panel, and then click <b>Search</b> to start the search.
</p>

<p>Progress bars in the main MOE window and in the Scaffold Replacement panel
allow you to keep track of the search.  A search can be terminated by
selecting <b>Stop Search</b> in the panel.  Once the search is complete, use
the <b>Database Viewer</b> to review the results.</p></li>

<li><i>Review the results.</i><br />
In the results database, start the Database Browser:

<blockquote>
<span class="menu">DBV | File | Browse</span>
</blockquote>

<p>
The browsed molecules will be rendered in line mode.  To make it easier to 
view the results, click</p>

<blockquote>
<span class="menu">MOE | RHS | System</span>
</blockquote>

<p>This shows a list of the molecular objects in the MOE system.  The
initial view is grouped by the chain tag. The receptor and ligand from
<tt>1ioe.pdb</tt> have the chain tag <tt>1IOE</tt>. The molecule from
the database browser has no chain tag and is listed as <tt>(no name)</tt>.
Click the line button to the right hand side of this and select the
stick mode from the panel that opens.  Click the gray box and 
click the green button to color the carbon atoms green.
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="scaff_tut/system.png" alt="Rendering from the System panel" /></p>

<p>
Reviewing the results, you will find that the new molecules have the
desired chloronapthyl and pyridine R-groups, but now these groups are linked
by new scaffolds.  The molecules do not have heavy atom clashes with the
receptor, as this is automatically taken into account during the scaffold
replacement search (as long as <b>Receptor</b> has been set to "Receptor Atoms"
in the Scaffold Replacement panel).</p>

<p>
Extra information about the numbers of molecules that were 
processed during the search can be found on the <b>SVL Commands Window</b>. To 
open this, click <b>SVL</b> in the top right corner of the main MOE window. 
You will see the number of molecules that failed to pass the descriptor 
filter (and other checks).  Be aware that if these filters are made too
restrictive, the search may return no hits.</p></li>

<li><i>Close the Database Browser</i><br />
After you have finished examining the results, click <b>Close</b> in the 
Database Browser panel.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Refine the scaffold search using a pharmacophore query</h3>

<p>
If you recall, the acceptor electrostatic map calculated from the receptor 
superposed well with the carbonyl oxygen of the ligand. We can add a 
requirement for a matching feature in our new scaffolds using a 
pharmacophore query filter.</p>

<ol start="1">
<li><p><i>Define an Acceptor Feature.</i></p>

<p>In the Scaffold Replacement panel, click <b>Editor...</b> to 
launch the <b>Pharmacophore Query Editor</b>.<br /><br />
Add a feature to the carbonyl oxygen by selecting it and clicking
<b>Feature</b> in the <b>Pharmacophore Query Editor</b>:</p>

<p><span class="tip"><b>Tip:</b></span>
Make sure that in the <span class="menu">MOE | Footer | ZClip</span>,
the <b>SF</b> slider is at the bottom and the <b>SW</b> slider is
at the top.  Otherwise, graphic objects for features in the 
<b>Pharmacophore Query Editor</b> may not be visible.</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="scaff_tut/scaff_acc.png" alt="Acceptor Feature" /></p>
</li>

<li><p><i>Define an Atom Feature.</i></p>
<p>We can use a SMARTS expression to preserve the nitrogen atom 
forming the 4-amino pyridine.  (This has a significant effect on the pKa of the
pyridine nitrogen and is essential for activity in enzyme assays.) Select 
the nitrogen atom and click <b>Feature</b> in the 
<b>Pharmacophore Query Editor</b>.</p>
<p>Modify the <b>F2:</b> field so that it reads:
<tt>&quot;[#7]&quot;</tt> and click <b>Apply</b>:</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="scaff_tut/smart_feat.png" alt="SMARTS feature" /></p>
</li>

<li><p><i>Define the R-groups.</i></p>
<p>You will now need to reselect the two root atoms that define the R-groups. 
This is easier if you click <span class="menu"> MOE | RHS | R</span>.
When the <b>R</b> button is red, Receptor atoms will be ignored when
clicking atoms in the main MOE window.</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="scaff_tut/rsl.png" alt="R, S and L buttons" /></p>

<p>Left click away from any atoms to clear the
current selection, then hold down <b>Shift</b> and click on the two atoms
described earlier in this tutorial.  The scaffold should again be highlighted
in green.</p>
</li>

<li><p><i>Change the output database name and start the search.</i></p>
<p>Change the <b>Output Database</b> to <tt>srsearch_acc_N.mdb</tt>.
Make sure the <b>Open Database Viewer</b> box is still selected (so the new
database will open), and click <b>Search</b> to start the search.
Once the search is complete, use the <b>Database Viewer</b> to review the
results.</p></li>

<li><p><i>Review the results</i></p>
<p>Start a Database Browser:</p>
<p class="indent_novspace">
<span class="menu">DBV | File | Browse</span></p>
<p>Set the browsed molecules to stick mode with green carbon atoms 
using the <span class="menu">MOE | RHS | System</span> panel to make
the results easier to view, as 
described earlier.  You might wish to disable rendering of the ligand 
annotation points.  To do this, in the <b>Pharmacophore Query Editor</b>, 
change <b>Ligand Annotation</b> to <b>None</b>:</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="scaff_tut/scaff_result.png" alt="Browsing the search results" /></p>

<p>You will find that there are far fewer results returned than for the first 
search, and that they match the pharmacophore query features.</p></li>

<li><p><i>Close the Database Browser</i></p>
<p>After you have finished examining the results, click <b>Close</b> in the 
Database Browser panel.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Using the receptor atoms to refine the results</h3>

<p>
The previous searches have used the receptor atoms to create an excluded 
volume that ensures that there are no heavy atom clashes between the new 
molecules and the receptor.  The position of the resulting molecules has not, 
however, been optimized within the active site.  This can be included in 
the Scaffold Replacement search process.</p>

<ol start="1">
<li><p><i>Turn on protein/ligand refinement.</i>></p>
<p>Select <b>Minimize Generated Structures</b>. (If desired, receptor
flexibility can be considered by clicking the <b>Configure...</b> button 
and unselecting the <b>Receptor Fix</b> box).</p></li>

<li><p><i>Select a scoring method.</i></p>
<p>Set <b>Scoring</b> to <b>London dG</b>. (For more information on these
scoring functions, see the manual page on 
<a href="../apps/docking.htm">Molecular Docking</a>).  Ligand efficiency
as with <a href="../apps/ligx.htm">LigX</a> is calculated when this
scoring function is used.</p></li>

<li><p><i>Change the output database name and start the search</i></p>
<p>Change the <b>Output Database</b> to <tt>sreplace_acc_N_min.mdb</tt>,
and click <b>Search</b> to start the search.</p></li>

<li><p><i>Review the results.</i></p>
<p>Start a Database Browser:</p>
<p class="indent_novspace">
<span class="menu">DBV | File | Browse</span></p>

<p>You will now find that while the retained R-groups are not necessarily in
exactly the same position as in the input ligand, the overall geometry of
the ligand atoms and their position with respect to the receptor is much
improved.  You can also use the <b>MM/GBVI</b> and <b>London dG</b> fields
in the database to rank the output molecules.  Right click on either field's
header and choose
<span class="menu">DBV | Field Popup | Sort | Ascending</span>.
Now when you browse the results you will be looking at them ordered by their
predicted ability to interact with the receptor.  As the <b>London dG</b>
function was used, the <b>Ligand Efficiency</b> field is calculated for
each structure.</p></li>
