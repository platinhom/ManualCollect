<form action="http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/form_action.asp">
  E-mail: <input type="email" id="myEmail" name="email" autocomplete="on">
  <input type="submit">
</form>

<p>Click the "Try it" button to set autocomplete in the email field to "off".</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> If you are new to the autocomplete attribute, fill in an email in the input field and submit the form, then reload the page, start to fill in the same values in the email field again - and see how autocomplete works. Then, click the "Try it" button to set autocomplete to "off" - if you type something in the email field now, the browser will not suggest values based on values that you have entered before.</p>

<button onclick="myFunction()">Try it</button>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> input elements with type="email" are not supported in IE 9 (and earlier), or Safari.</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
function myFunction() {
    document.getElementById("myEmail").autocomplete = "off";
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "autocomplete is now 'off'.";
}
</script>

</body>
