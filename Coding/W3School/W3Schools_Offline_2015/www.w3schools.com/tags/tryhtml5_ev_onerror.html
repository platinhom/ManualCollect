<img src="image.html" onerror="myFunction()">

<p>A function is triggered if an error occurs when loading the image. The function shows an alert box with a text. In this example we refer to an image that does not exist, therefore the onerror event occurs.</p>

<script>
function myFunction() {
    alert("The image could not be loaded.");
}
</script>

</body>
