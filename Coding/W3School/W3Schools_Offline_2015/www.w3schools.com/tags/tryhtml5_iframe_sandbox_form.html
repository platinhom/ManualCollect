  <p>Your browser does not support iframes.</p>
</iframe>

<p>The "Submit" button will submit the form in the inline frame.</p>
<p>Since the sandbox attribute is set to an empty string (""), the submission of the form in the inline frame will be blocked.</p>
<p>Add "allow-forms" to the sandbox attribute, to allow form submission.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The sandbox attribute is not supported in Internet Explorer 9 and earlier versions, or in Opera 12 and earlier.</p>
