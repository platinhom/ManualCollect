</ul>


<a name="interaction"></a>
<h2>Interaction</h2>

<p>Maestro functionality is organized into a collection of task-oriented panels
that are accessible from the menus. Each panel allows access to some subset
of the program's functionality, e.g reading a structure, defining a set of atoms,
or selecting energy settings. </p>

<p>The panels in Maestro do not communicate directly with the rest of the program.  They
generate text commands that are supplied to the program and then executed. So at
the lowest level Maestro is a completely command-driven program. This has two
important consequences: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>All actions can be logged and replayed exactly as they were first performed.
This makes the program scriptable, and tools are provided to allow users to create
command scripts from scratch or based on editing a set of previously performed actions.
</p></li>
<li><p>Users can choose to interact with the program, entirely or in part by direct
typing of commands instead of using the mouse.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Thus Maestro is a command-based, object-oriented GUI written
mostly in C++. This means that users may accomplish tasks by either taking graphical
actions (clicking buttons, selecting options, etc.) or by entering and
executing textual commands. The equivalent to a user's graphical actions are recorded
as a command or commands. These can be stored for use at a later point.  </p>

<a name="about5"></a>
<h2>Interaction Paradigms</h2>

<p>Maestro uses two interaction paradigms:</p>
<ul><li><b>Selection First:</b> select objects then choose an action</li>
<li><b>Action First:</b> choose an action then select objects</li>
</ul>
<p>By default, Maestro is in &quot;selection first&quot; mode.
Said equivalently it is noun -- verb:
you select objects then specify the action to take. For example, you can click an atom
or drag to select several
atoms, then open the <span class="GUI">Molecular Representation</span> panel,
choose a representation, and click <span class="GUI">Apply</span>.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can choose an action first. Following the above example,
you can open the <span class="GUI">Molecular Representation</span> panel,
choose a representation,
and then select the atoms to which to apply that representation.</p>

<p>The command language uses the &quot;action first&quot; paradigm. For example:</p>
<p>
<tt>repatom rep=cpk</tt> <br />
<tt>repatom atom. 1-14</tt> </p>

<p>These commands change the style of atoms 1-14 to the CPK representation. The
first command (<tt>repatom rep=cpk</tt>) does not change anything on-screen. It
only says that atom representations that are set from this point forward will be
CPK. The second <tt>repatom</tt> command actually sets atoms 1-14 to CPK. From
this last command one can see the "verb+noun" paradigm. The verb is
<tt>repatom</tt>; the noun is <tt>atom. 1-14</tt>. </p>



<a name="panels"></a>
<h2>Dialog Boxes and Panels </h2>

<p>There are two classes of &quot;windows&quot; that are displayed in Maestro.
The first class is <i>dialog boxes</i>, used to display informational or
warning messages. Dialog boxes are modal and must be dismissed by the user
before further actions can be taken. Some dialog boxes allow you to perform
actions in the Workspace, such as atom selection, but otherwise do not permit
interaction with other windows.</p>

<p>The second class is <i>panels</i>. Panels are used to perform the real work in Maestro.
Most panels in Maestro are amodal: they may be displayed for extended periods and any
number of panels may be displayed simultaneously. You
can move back and forth between these visible panels, doing as much
or as little work in each as you wish. There is no requirement to hide
a panel in Maestro before working in another panel.  (Of course, you may wish
to hide panels to reduce screen clutter.)</p>

<p>There are some groups of panels (such as the MacroModel panels) that display a
kind of modal behavior in the group: you can only have one panel from the group
open at any one time. If you open another panel from the group, the first panel
is dismissed. These panels usually perform mutually exclusive tasks for a particular
application.</p>

<p>In Maestro all changes are recorded immediately. For example, if you select
an option, the value is changed immediately.  There is no <span
class="GUI">Accept</span> button to commit the changes, nor is there a <span
class="GUI">Cancel</span> button to abort the changes.  Whenever a setting is
changed in the GUI, the internal state of the program is immediately updated.
</p>

<a name="workflow"></a>
<h2>Workflow Paradigm</h2>

<p>The principal Maestro workflow paradigm is &quot;build first, then perform
task&quot; (this is a different concept from the interaction model of &quot;act
first, pick second&quot;).  The &quot;build first, then perform task&quot;
paradigm in Maestro means you first make all necessary modifications to the
structures.  Next, select settings  in preparation for performing tasks.
Finally, execute the task or tasks. Deletions to the current structures cause a
&quot;ripple effect&quot;. Any panel with a list of atoms (or atom-based items
like atom pairs, torsions, etc.) has entries containing the just deleted atoms
removed. </p>

<p>For example, suppose you select a number of constrained atoms: 1, 5, and 10.
Then later you delete atoms 1 and 5. The list of constrained atoms no longer
contains entries for atom 1 or atom 5.  </p>

<p>Maestro also supports the &quot;pick first, act second&quot; paradigm for
operations on structures, as well as the &quot;act first, pick second&quot; paradigm.</p>

<a name="gui"></a>
<h2>GUI Layout</h2>

<p>The Maestro GUI consists of a main window, with panels and dialog boxes that
can be opened from the menus on this window. The main window consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Menu bar:</b> Located at the top of the window.
Provides access to the various task-based panels in Maestro.
</li>
<li><b>Workspace:</b> The large molecular display area in the center. Used for
drawing and interacting with 3D structures.
</li>
<li><b>Toolbars:</b> Located at the top by default. The toolbars contain buttons
for manipulating the structures in the Workspace, controlling the appearance of 
structures and performance of common tasks.
</li>
<li><b>Status bar:</b> Located below Workspace. Provides information on objects
displayed in the Workspace.
</li>
<li><b>Sequence viewer:</b> Located below the status bar.
Displays the sequence of any displayed protein.
</li>
<li><b>Command input area:</b> Located below the sequence viewer.
Allows you to enter and execute Maestro commands.
</li>
<li><b>Context-sensitive help:</b> Located at the lower edge of the main window.
Displays task-specific help, including hints on
how to complete the current task when selecting atoms is required.
</li>
</ul>

<a name="selection"></a>
<h2>Selecting Atoms</h2>
<p>Maestro has a powerful set of tools for selecting atoms:
<a href="../tool_bar/toolbars.html">toolbar buttons</a>,
<a href="../misc/picking_controls.html">picking tools</a> in panels,
and the <a href="../misc/asd.html"><span class="GUI">Atom Selection</span>
dialog box</a>.
With all these tools, you can choose a structural unit for selecting atoms, 
from <span class="GUI">Atoms</span>, <span class="GUI">Bonds</span>,
<span class="GUI">Residues</span>, <span class="GUI">Chains</span>,
<span class="GUI">Molecules</span>, or <span class="GUI">Entries</span>,
then click on an atom in the Workspace to perform the action on all the atoms in
that structural unit.</p>

<p>For example, to select all the atoms in a residue, click and hold the
<span class="GUI">Select</span> button on the <span class="GUI">Edit</span>
toolbar, choose <span class="GUI">Residue</span> from the button menu, and click
on an atom in the desired residue. All the atoms in that residue are
selected.</p>

<p>Each tool has a list of permitted structural units. The set of available
structural units varies depending on the task represented by the button or
panel.</p> 

<a name="commands"></a>
<h2>Text Commands</h2>

<p>Maestro has a command language that can be used to perform GUI functions and
other operations. For information about the syntax of Maestro commands, see the
topic <a href="../misc/syntax.html">Maestro Command Language Syntax</a>.</p>

<p>All commands in Maestro are logged. The
<a href="../window_menu/cse_panel.html">Command Script Editor Panel</a> can be
used to view these commands as well as to create, modify, save, and run command
scripts.</p>
