<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
In this tab, you specify the model system for the MCPRO+ calculation. This task
is required for all MCPRO+ calculations, and involves selecting the receptor and
ligands as appropriate, truncating (chopping) and capping the protein,
neutralizing the system, and defining constraints. The resulting model system is
written out in a series of files that include a Z-matrix file and a Maestro file.
</p>

<h2>Model System Creation Tab Features</h2> 


<p>The Model System Creation tab provides a wizard-like interface that takes you
through the stages of setting up a model system. For new systems that contain
proteins, there are five steps. For ligand-only systems, two of these steps are
not present.</p>

<p>Each step contains the main controls for the step, then
a <span class="GUI">Display Options</span> section, below which is a Guide for
navigating between the steps. The Guide consists of a button for each step,
connected by arrows. The buttons for steps that are not available are dimmed.
The <span class="GUI">Display Options</span> section contains options for
displaying the various structures belonging to the model in the Workspace. </p>

<p>The main controls for each step, and the common <span class="GUI">Display
Options</span> section, are described below.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#feature1"><span class="GUI">Import</span> step</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature2"><span class="GUI">Chop/Cap</span> step</a></li>

<h3>Import step</h3>

<p>In this step, you define the type of system and import the structures for the
calculation. There are two sections in the main part of the step.
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#feature1.1"><span class="GUI">Model system</span> section</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature1.2"><span class="GUI">Import</span> section</a></li>
</ul>

<dl>

<a name="feature1.1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Model system</span> section</dt>
<dd><p>In this section, you choose the basic types of structures to be included
in the system, and set a base name for the model system.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><span class="GUI">Model system basename</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>Set the base name for files created to store information for the model
system.
</p></dd>
<dt>System options</dt>
<dd><p>These options define the system type. The options vary according to the
type of calculation, and can include one or more of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="GUI">Protein-ligand complex</span></li>
<li><span class="GUI">Ligands only</span></li>
<li><span class="GUI">Protein only</span></li>
</ul>
<p>When you choose a system option that does not contain a protein, the <span
class="GUI">Chop/Cap</span> and <span class="GUI">Neutralize</span> steps are
removed from the Guide, since they are no longer relevant.
</p></dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<a name="feature1.2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Import</span> section</dt>
<dd><p>In this section, you import the structures or the Z-matrix for the
system. The controls available depend on the choice of the system type.
The structures must be valid structures in Maestro format.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><span class="GUI">Ligand structures</span> controls</dt>
<dd><p>Enter the name of the ligand structure file in the text box, or click
<span class="GUI">Browse</span> and navigate to the file. The file name is
displayed in the text box. The number of ligands to be imported depends on the
type of job. The ligand is imported and displayed in the Workspace when you have
entered the file name or clicked <span class="GUI">OK</span> in the file
chooser.</p>
<p>You can also select <span class="GUI">Use charges
from input structures</span> to make use of the partial charges stored with the
ligands, rather than generate them from the force field.
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Protein structure</span> controls</dt>
<dd><p>Enter the name of the protein structure file in the text box, or click
<span class="GUI">Browse</span> and navigate to the file. The file name is
displayed in the text box. The protein structure must not include a ligand, but
can include cofactors, metal ions, and so on. The protein is imported and
displayed in the Workspace when you have entered the file name or clicked <span
class="GUI">OK</span> in the file chooser.</p>
<p>If the protein was used previously for a model system, you can select <span
class="GUI">Use associated protein zmatrix instead of regenerating</span> to
skip over the protein preparation steps. Selecting this option removes the
<span class="GUI">Chop/Cap</span> and <span class="GUI">Neutralize</span> steps
from the Guide.
</p>
<p>For protein-ligand complexes, you can choose to import a reference ligand that
will be used in the next two steps, for protein truncation and neutralization.
To do so, select <span class="GUI">Use imported reference ligand in model system
creation</span>, then enter the name of the ligand structure file in the text
box, or click <span class="GUI">Browse</span> and navigate to the file. The file
name is displayed in the text box.</p>
<p>For protein-only calculations, you <i>must</i> import a reference ligand to
be used in the next two steps, for protein truncation and neutralization.  To do
so, enter the name of the ligand structure file in the 
<span class="GUI">Reference ligand structure</span> text box, or click 
<span class="GUI">Browse</span> and navigate to the file. 
The file name is displayed in the text box.</p>
</dd>

</dl>
<p>When you have made your choices, the button for the next step becomes
available, and you can click it to proceed. 
</p>

</dd>

</dl>

<a name="feature2"></a>
<h3>Chop/Cap step</h3>

<p>This step is only available when a protein is being used. The purpose of the
step is to truncate (&quot;chop&quot;) the protein, and cap the truncated parts
with NMA or ACE. There is only one section, <span class="GUI">Chop</span>, with
the following features:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><span class="GUI">Keep protein residues within <i>N</i> &Aring; of reference
ligand</span> option and text box</dt>
<dd><p>Select this option if you want to chop the protein at a specified
distance from the ligand, and enter the distance in the text box. The reference
ligand is used for this purpose if one has been provided.  The residues
that are within this distance are colored yellow, and residues outside this
distance are colored blue.</p>
<p>The truncation procedure keeps all residues in the protein that are within
the specified distance of any atom in the ligand, and the residues at the cut
are capped with NMA or ACE as appropriate. A smaller protein model also means
that the number of solvent water molecules added to the system will be smaller.
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Do not chop protein system</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Select this option if you do not want the protein to be truncated. The
time taken for the simulations and the number of solvent waters added to the
system is related to the protein size. If you select this option, the <span
class="GUI">Neutralize</span> button becomes available, and you can proceed to
the next step.
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Chop/Cap Protein</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Click this button to perform the truncation. A message is displayed in
the lower part of the panel while the truncation job is running. If you select
<span class="GUI">Keep protein residues within <i>N</i> &Aring; of reference
ligand</span>, you must click this button to chop the protein. After the protein
is truncated, the <span class="GUI">Neutralize</span> button becomes available,
and you can proceed to the next step. The capping groups are now displayed in
blue. 
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Reset Protein</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Click this button to undo the truncation.
</p></dd>

</dl>

<a name="feature3"></a>
<h3>Neutralize Step</h3>
<p>This step is only available when a protein is being used. The purpose of the
step is to ensure overall electrical neutrality of the protein or protein-ligand
complex. This is important to obtain good results. Neutralization is performed
by adding or removing protons from ionizable residues that are distant from the
ligand.</p>

<p>There is one section for this step, <span class="GUI">Neutralize
system</span>, which has two options for neutralizing the protein, and action
buttons to perform or undo the neutralization task. Residues that are
neutralized are highlighted in a unique color in the Workspace.</p>
<dl>
<dt><span class="GUI">Neutralize to first ligand charge</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Select this option to neutralize the complex by adding or removing
protons from the protein so that the protein charge balances the ligand charge,
and the charge on the complex is zero.
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Target protein charge</span> option and text box</dt>
<dd><p>Select this option to add or remove protons from the protein so that the
protein charge is equal to the value given in the text box.
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Neutralize Protein</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Click this button to perform the neutralization. A message is displayed in
the lower part of the panel while the neutralization job is running. When the
job finishes, the residues that were deprotonated are colored red, those that
were protonated are colored yellow, and the remaining residues are colored gray.
You must click this button to neutralize the protein and proceed to the next
step. After the protein is neutralized, the <span class="GUI">Constrain</span>
button becomes available, and you can proceed to the next step.
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Reset Protein</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Reset the protein to its original state, before addition or removal of
protons.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<a name="feature4"></a>
<h3>Constrain Step</h3>
<p>In this step, you choose which parts of the protein are treated flexibly, and
whether the ligands or cofactors are kept rigid or allowed to be flexible. 
If you are doing a minimization, the choices you make in this section affect the
choice of optimization method 
(see the <a href="minimization_tab.html">Minimization Tab</a> topic). 
</p>
<p>There is one section for this step, <span class="GUI">Constrain
molecules</span>.</p> 

<dl>
<dt><span class="GUI">Protein</span> options</dt>
<dd><p>There are three options for constraining the protein:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="GUI">Residue side chains within N &Aring; are
flexible</span>&mdash;Atoms in the side chains of residues that are within the 
specified distance of the ligand are allowed to move; all other atoms are held
fixed, including the backbone atoms for residues whose side chains are flexible.
Side chains within this distance are colored yellow; all other atoms are colored
blue.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Fully flexible</span>&mdash;All atoms in the
protein are allowed to move.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Fully rigid</span>&mdash;No atoms in the protein
are allowed to move.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Ligands</span> options</dt>
<dd><p>There are only two options, to make the ligands flexible, i.e. allow all
atoms in the ligands to move, or make the ligands rigid, in which case all
ligand atoms are kept fixed.
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Cofactors</span> options</dt>
<dd><p>There are only two options, to make the cofactors flexible, i.e. allow all
atoms in the cofactors to move, or make the ligands rigid, in which case all
cofactor atoms are kept fixed. Cofactors include metal atoms, counter ions, and
so on.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>This section completes the selection of options. When you click <span
class="GUI">Create Model</span>, a job is run to set up the files for the model
system, and the final step is displayed when the job finishes.</p>

<a name="feature5"></a>
<h3>Model Step</h3>
<p>This &quot;step&quot; presents the results of the creation of the model
system files. No action is required. You can examine the log file for the job
that writes the files to ensure that the system is set up correctly and that
there were no errors.
</p>


<a name="feature6"></a>
<h3>Display Options Section</h3>

<p>This section contains options for the display of each of the structures in the
model system. The controls depend on the model system and the calculation type.
For most models, there is a list of options for each structure. For FEP
calculations, there is an <span class="GUI">Animate Ligand Perturbation</span>
button, which animates the perturbation in the Workspace.</p>
