<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>In this panel you can set up and run a search for molecules that have similar
shape to a shape query, which is either a template molecule or a set of spheres
of defined radius and coordinates. For more information, see 
<a href="../../../phase/phase_user_manual.pdf"
target="pdfmanuals">Chapter 14 of the Phase User Manual</a>.
</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Shape Screening Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Shape Screening</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Applications &rarr; Phase &rarr; Shape Screening</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
</ul>


<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Shape Screening Panel</h2> 


<p>To set up a search by shape:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Choose the source of the shape from the <span class="GUI">Use
shape query from</span> option menu.
</p>
<p>If you chose <span class="GUI">File</span>, enter the file name in the
<span class="GUI">Shape query file</span> text box or click
<span class="GUI">Browse</span> to browse to the file.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Choose the source of the structures to be screened from the 
<span class="GUI">Screen structures in</span> option menu.
</p>
<p>If you chose <span class="GUI">File</span> or <span class="GUI">Phase
database</span>, enter the file name or Phase database name in the <span
class="GUI">File name</span> text box, or click <span class="GUI">Browse</span>
to browse to the file or database.
</p></li>
<li><p>If the structures to be searched do not include conformer sets, you can
choose to generate conformers, by selecting <span class="GUI">Generate
conformers</span>. 
</p>
<p>If you want to limit the number of conformers generated per input
structure, enter a value in the <span class="GUI">Maximum number of
conformers</span> text box, or enter a value in the <span class="GUI">Retain up
to <i>N</i> conformers per rotatable bond</span> text box, or both.   
</p>
<p>If you are generating conformers, choose an amide bond treatment.
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose an atom type for use in volume scoring. Volume overlaps
are only calculated for atoms of the same type. 
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Job Settings</span> from the <span
class="GUI">Settings</span> button menu,</p>
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/settings.png" />
<p>set the job parameters in the <span class="GUI">Job Settings</span> dialog
box, and click <span class="GUI">Run</span> to run the job.
You can distribute searches over multiple processors if you are searching a
database or generating conformers. 
</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If you want control over other aspects of the screening run, click <span
class="GUI">Options</span> and make the settings in the <a
href="shape_screening_options_db.html">Shape Screening - Options</a> dialog
box.

<ul>
<li><span class="GUI">Pharmacophore types</span>&mdash;Treat each structure as a
collection of pharmacophore sites, whose locations are assigned by applying
Phase pharmacophore feature definitions. Overlapping volumes are computed
only between sites of the same feature type. Each site is represented by a
sphere of radius 2&nbsp;&Aring;.</li>

<dt><span class="GUI">Generate conformers</span> section</dt>
<dd><p>Select the <span class="GUI">Generate conformers</span> option to
run a conformational search for the molecules being screened, using ConfGen. This
option is not needed if the input molecules already consist of conformer sets.
It is off by default if you choose to screen a Phase database, but you can turn
it on if the database does not contain conformers or if you want to generate
conformers anyway.
This section contains two text boxes and an option menu for making settings:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><span class="GUI">Existing conformers</span> options</dt>
<dd><p>Select an option for handling existing conformers:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="GUI">Discard</span>&mdash;Replace all existing conformers
and use only the generated conformers. This includes the input structure, if
there is only one. </li> 
<li><span class="GUI">Keep</span>&mdash;Append the generated conformers to the
existing set of conformers (which might be only one structure). Select this
option to guarantee that the input structure is included in the search.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Maximum number of conformers</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>Enter the maximum number of conformers per input molecule to be generated
in this text box. Default: 100.
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Retain up to <i>N</i> conformers per rotatable bond</span></dt>
<dd><p>Enter the number of conformers to keep per rotatable bond for
each input molecule. Default: 10.
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Amide bonds</span> option menu</dt>
<dd><p>Choose the treatment of amide bonds to be used in the conformational
search, from the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="GUI">Vary conformation</span>&mdash;allow the
conformation around the amide bond to vary freely.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Retain original conformation</span>&mdash;do
not vary the conformation around the amide bond, but keep the original
conformation.</li> 
<li><span class="GUI">Set to trans</span>&mdash;Set the conformation around the
amide bond to trans (180&deg;).</li>
</ul>
</dd>

make other settings for the screening process.
</p></dd>

<a name="job_toolbar"></a>
<dt>Job toolbar</dt>
<dd><p>The Job toolbar is used to make settings for a job and to start it. </p>

<dl>
<dt><span class="GUI">Job name</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>Enter a name for the job in this text box.
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Settings</span> button menu</dt>
<dd><p>This button opens the <a href="../misc/job_settings.html"><span
class="GUI">Job Settings</span> dialog box</a>. The arrow to the right opens
a menu, from which you can make settings or perform actions that are related to
the job. </p>
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/settings.png" />
<p>The menu items are described below.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="GUI">Job Settings</span>&mdash;Make and save settings for the
incorporation of the job into the Maestro project, the job name, the host,
the distribution of subjobs, and any other application-specific job settings.
Opens the <span class="GUI">Job Settings</span> dialog box.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Preferences</span>&mdash;Set general preferences for
running jobs. Opens the <span class="GUI">Preferences</span> panel at the <a

Starting</span> section</a>.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Write</span>&mdash;Write the input files for the job but do not start it.

their defaults.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Job status</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>This icon indicates when there are jobs running for the application that
belong to the current project. It starts spinning when the first job starts, and
stops when there are no more jobs running. If a job fails to start, it changes
to an exclamation point. 
</p>
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/job_status.png" />
<p>
Clicking the button shows a small job status window that lists the job name and
status for all active jobs submitted from the current panel (for Jaguar and
MacroModel this means all jobs from any of the application panels). You can
double-click on a row to open the <a href="../misc/monitor_panel.html"><span
class="GUI">Monitor</span> panel</a> and monitor the job, or click the <span
class="GUI">Monitor</span> button to open the <span class="GUI">Monitor</span>
panel and close the job status window. The job status is updated while the
window is open. If a job finishes while the window is open, the job remains
displayed but with the new status.  The rows are colored according to the
status: yellow for submitted, green for launched, running, or finished, red for
incorporated, died, or killed.  Click anywhere outside the window to close it.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Run</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Run the job with the current job settings.
</p></dd>
</dl>
</dd>


<a name="status_bar"></a>
<dt>Status bar</dt>
<dd><p>The status bar displays information about the current job settings for the
panel. This includes the job name, task name and task settings (if any), number
of subjobs (if any) and the host name and job incorporation setting. It also
displays a message for a short time when you start a new job.</p>
<p>The status bar also contains the <span class="GUI">Help</span> button, which
opens the help topic for the panel.</p>
