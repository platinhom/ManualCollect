<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Find alternative scaffolds for a template ligand by defining the scaffold,
replacing it by a set of alternative scaffolds with optional linkers, then
docking the resulting ligands to a receptor to score and rank them.
</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Glide-Based Core Hopping Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Glide-Based Core Hopping</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Applications &rarr; Core Hopping &rarr; Glide-based</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
</ul>


<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Glide-Based Core Hopping Panel</h2> 


<p>Glide-based core hopping first aligns the attachment bonds of the protocore
(the input structure) to those of the template, using any selected Glide
constraints, and writes out the resulting structures without any side chains at
the attachment points. It then adds the template side chains at the attachment
points of these structures, and docks them with Glide, again using any
constraints that have been selected. During the alignment, methylene linkers can
be added to the protocore to improve the alignment for cores that do not have
the same size or shape as the template.</p>
<p> 
You must generate the grid for the Glide docking before you start the core
hopping job: the job does not generate the grids for you. See <a
href="../glide/receptor_grid_generation.html">Glide &mdash; Receptor Grid
Generation Panel</a> for details of grid generation. Constraints to the receptor 
can be used in both the alignment stage and the docking stage, so it is worth
setting up the grid with the desired constraints.

<h3>Visualize Results tab</h3>
<p>In this tab you can visualize the results of a core hopping run. The run can
be any run - it is not restricted to the run just done in the <span
class="GUI">Find New Cores</span> tab. The template is fixed in the Workspace so
you can step through the new cores and see how they align to the template. The
attachment bonds are marked with arrows for the template and the new
structures. The arrows and the carbon atoms are colored green for the template,
and red for the new structure.</p>

the job. </p>
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/settings.png" />
<p>The menu items are described below.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="GUI">Job Settings</span>&mdash;Make and save settings for the
incorporation of the job into the Maestro project, the job name, the host,
the distribution of subjobs, and any other application-specific job settings.
Opens the <span class="GUI">Job Settings</span> dialog box.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Preferences</span>&mdash;Set general preferences for
running jobs. Opens the <span class="GUI">Preferences</span> panel at the <a
href="../maestro_menu/preferences.html#jobs_starting"><span class="GUI">Jobs - 
Starting</span> section</a>.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Write</span>&mdash;Write the input files for the job but do not start it. 
The file names are based on the current job name, and the files are written to
a subdirectory of the current working directory that is named with the job
name.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Job status</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>This icon indicates when there are jobs running for the application that
belong to the current project. It starts spinning when the first job starts, and
stops when there are no more jobs running. If a job fails to start, it changes
to an exclamation point. 
</p>
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/job_status.png" />
<p>
Clicking the button shows a small job status window that lists the job name and
status for all active jobs submitted from the current panel (for Jaguar and
MacroModel this means all jobs from any of the application panels). You can
double-click on a row to open the <a href="../misc/monitor_panel.html"><span
class="GUI">Monitor</span> panel</a> and monitor the job, or click the <span
class="GUI">Monitor</span> button to open the <span class="GUI">Monitor</span>
panel and close the job status window. The job status is updated while the
window is open. If a job finishes while the window is open, the job remains
displayed but with the new status.  The rows are colored according to the
status: yellow for submitted, green for launched, running, or finished, red for
incorporated, died, or killed.  Click anywhere outside the window to close it.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Run</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Run the job with the current job settings.
</p></dd>

<a name="status_bar"></a>
<h3>Status bar</h3>
<p>The status bar displays information about the current job settings for the
panel. This includes the job name, task name and task settings (if any), number
of subjobs (if any) and the host name and job incorporation setting. It also
displays a message for a short time when you start a new job.</p>
<p>The status bar also contains the <span class="GUI">Help</span> button, which
opens the help topic for the panel.</p>
