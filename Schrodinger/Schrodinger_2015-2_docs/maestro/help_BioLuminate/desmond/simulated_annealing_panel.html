<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Set up and run a simulated annealing calculation. 
</p>

<h2>Opening the Simulated Annealing Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Simulated Annealing</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Applications &rarr; Desmond &rarr; Simulated Annealing</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
</ul>

<a name="model_system"></a>
<h3>Model system section</h3>

<p>In this section, you select the model system that you will use for the
simulation. A valid model system must contain both the coordinates of the
particles and the force field parameters. A file of a valid model system
normally has the <code>.cms</code> extension. </p>

<p>There are two options on the option menu, and the tools in this
section depend on which option you choose.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><span class="GUI">Load from Workspace</span></dt>
<dd><p>Load the model system from the Workspace. The Workspace must contain a
model system that has already been prepared with the <span class="GUI">System
Builder</span> panel. 
When you choose this item, the <span
class="GUI">Load</span> button is displayed, which you click to load the model
system from the Workspace.
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Import from file</span></dt>
<dd><p>Import the model system from a file. You can choose to import a model
system file (<code>.cms</code>) or a checkpoint file 
(<span class="GUI">.cpt</span>). </p>
<p>If you import a model system file, it  must contain a model
system that has already been prepared with the <span class="GUI">System
Setup</span> panel. When the file is imported, a message about the system is
displayed below the option menu. </p>
<p>If you import a checkpoint file, most of the panel controls are
unavailable. The purpose of the checkpoint file is to restart an 
interrupted simulation, so the parameters of the simulation cannot be
altered. You can change the total simulation time, and then start the job.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<a name="simulation"></a>
<h3>Simulation section</h3>
<p>In this section, you make settings for the Simulated Annealing job.  The main
specific task is to provide information on the stages by providing a schedule of
reference temperature changes. The last stage runs until the specified total simulation time.
</p>

<dl>

<dt><span class="GUI">Number of stages</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>Specify the number of stages in the simulated annealing process.
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Time</span> text boxes</dt>
<dd><p>Specify the starting time for each stage. 
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Temperature</span> text boxes</dt>
<dd><p>Specify the starting temperature for each stage. 
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Simulation time</span> text boxes</dt>
<dd><p>Specify the total time of the simulation, in ns, in the <span
class="GUI">total</span> text box. The <span class="GUI">elapsed</span> text box
displays the amount of time the simulation has already run, if you are
restarting a simulation. For new simulations it should contain zero. This text
box cannot be edited. 
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Recording interval</span> text boxes</dt>
<dd><p>Specify the recording period for the energy and the trajectory. Enter a
value in ps in the text box. Values entered in this text box are rounded to an
integer multiple of the far time step size. By default, the far time step size
is 0.006&nbsp;ps. This time step size is set in the  
<a href="advanced_options_db.html"><span class="GUI">Integration</span> tab of
the <span class="GUI">Advanced Options</span> dialog box</a>, in the 
<span class="GUI">RESPA integrator</span> section.</p></dd> 

<dt><span class="GUI">Ensemble class</span> option menu</dt>
<dd><p>Choose the ensemble class from this option menu. Five classes are
available: NVE, NVT, NPT, NPAT, and NP&gamma;T.
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Pressure</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>Specify the pressure to be used. Not available for the NVE and NVT
ensemble classes.
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Surface tension</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>Specify the surface tension to be used. Only available for the NP&gamma;T
ensemble class.
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Relax model system before simulation</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>When selected, a series of minimizations and short molecular dynamics
simulations are performed to relax the model system before performing the
simulation you set up. The relaxation procedure follows a default
protocol. Normally, this option is needed only for model systems that 
have just been prepared with the <span class="GUI">System Builder</span> panel
and have not been relaxed.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature3"></a>
<h3>Advanced Options button</h3>
<p>Opens the <a href="advanced_options_db.html"><span class="GUI">Advanced
Options</span> dialog box</a>, in which you can control many more of the
detailed settings for the simulation than are available in the 
<span class="GUI">Desmond</span> panel. 
</p>

<a name="job_toolbar"></a>
<h3>Job toolbar</h3>
<p>The Job toolbar is used to make settings for a job and to start it. </p>

<dl>
<dt><span class="GUI">Job name</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>Enter a name for the job in this text box.
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Settings</span> button menu</dt>
<dd><p>This button opens the <a href="../misc/job_settings.html"><span
class="GUI">Job Settings</span> dialog box</a>. The arrow to the right opens
a menu, from which you can make settings or perform actions that are related to
the job. </p>
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/settings.png" />
<p>The menu items are described below.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="GUI">Job Settings</span>&mdash;Make and save settings for the
incorporation of the job into the Maestro project, the job name, the host,
the distribution of subjobs, and any other application-specific job settings.
Opens the <span class="GUI">Job Settings</span> dialog box.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Preferences</span>&mdash;Set general preferences for
running jobs. Opens the <span class="GUI">Preferences</span> panel at the <a
href="../maestro_menu/preferences.html#jobs_starting"><span class="GUI">Jobs - 
Starting</span> section</a>.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Read</span>&mdash;Read an input(configuration)file and apply the settings in the file to the panel controls.
Opens a file selector in which you can navigate to the desired input file.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Write</span>&mdash;Write the input files for the job but do not start it. 
The file names are based on the current job name, and the files are written to
a subdirectory of the current working directory that is named with the job
name.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Reset Panel</span>&mdash;Reset the values in the panel to 
their defaults.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Job status</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>This icon indicates when there are jobs running for the application that
belong to the current project. It starts spinning when the first job starts, and
stops when there are no more jobs running. If a job fails to start, it changes
to an exclamation point. 
</p>
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/job_status.png" />
<p>
Clicking the button shows a small job status window that lists the job name and
status for all active jobs submitted from the current panel (for Jaguar and
MacroModel this means all jobs from any of the application panels). You can
double-click on a row to open the <a href="../misc/monitor_panel.html"><span
class="GUI">Monitor</span> panel</a> and monitor the job, or click the <span
class="GUI">Monitor</span> button to open the <span class="GUI">Monitor</span>
panel and close the job status window. The job status is updated while the
window is open. If a job finishes while the window is open, the job remains
displayed but with the new status.  The rows are colored according to the
status: yellow for submitted, green for launched, running, or finished, red for
incorporated, died, or killed.  Click anywhere outside the window to close it.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Run</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Run the job with the current job settings.
</p></dd>
</dl>


<a name="status_bar"></a>
<h3>Status bar</h3>
<p>The status bar displays information about the current job settings for the
panel. This includes the job name, task name and task settings (if any), number
of subjobs (if any) and the host name and job incorporation setting. It also
displays a message for a short time when you start a new job.</p>
<p>The status bar also contains the <span class="GUI">Help</span> button, which
opens the help topic for the panel.</p>
