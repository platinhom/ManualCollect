<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>In this panel you can set up and run jobs to calculate Fukui functions.
</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Fukui Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Fukui</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Applications &rarr; Jaguar &rarr; Fukui Functions</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Tasks &rarr; Small Molecule Tasks &rarr; Quantum Mechanics &rarr; Advanced &rarr; Fukui Functions</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
</ul>


<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Fukui Panel</h2> 


<p>The Fukui functions are calculated by finite difference as the derivative of
the electron density with respect to the number of electrons. Since the
derivative is discontinuous at integer numbers of electrons, there are two
functions: one for increasing the number of electrons (f+) and one for
decreasing the number of electrons (f-). The derivatives are calculated by
incrementing the charge by a fractional amount and running an SCF calculation
with a fractional occupation in either the HOMO or LUMO. The functions are
generated by taking the difference in electron density for the incremented
system and the unperturbed system on a grid of points, which can then be used to
display the function as a surface in Maestro. The original density and the
incremented and decremented densities are also available, and the Fukui indices
are also calculated.
</p>

<p>Fukui functions can be calculated with any wave function from which a density
can be generated, any basis set, and for either closed-shell or open-shell
molecules. For the latter, UHF or UDFT is enforced.

<h2>Fukui Panel Features</h2> 


<p>The common features of the <a href="jaguar_panel.html"><span
class="GUI">Jaguar</span> panel</a> are part of this panel. The task-specific
features are listed below.
</p>


<ul>
<li><a href="#feature1"><span class="GUI">Calculate f+</span> and 
<span class="GUI">Calculate f-</span> options</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature2"><span class="GUI">Fraction of electron</span> text
box</a></li> 
<li><a href="#feature3"><span class="GUI">Keywords</span> text box</a></li>
<li><a href="#job_toolbar">Job toolbar</a></li>
<li><a href="#status_bar">Status bar</a></li>
</ul>

<dl>

<a name="feature1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Calculate f+</span> and <span class="GUI">Calculate
f-</span> options</dt> 
<dd><p>Select these options to calculate the Fukui functions for addition (f+)
and removal (f-) of an electron. 
</p></dd>

<a name="feature2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Fraction of electron</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>Enter the fraction of an electron that is used to increment the charge in
the HOMO or LUMO in the finite difference method for the derivative.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Keywords</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>Enter <b>gen</b> section keywords for the calculation. Because of the
nature of the calculations, keywords for anything other than an SCF calculation
are not allowed.
</p></dd>

<a name="job_toolbar"></a>
<dt>Job toolbar</dt>
<dd><p>The Job toolbar is used to make settings for a job and to start it. </p>

<dl>
<dt><span class="GUI">Job name</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>Enter a name for the job in this text box.
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Settings</span> button menu</dt>
<dd><p>This button opens the <a href="../misc/job_settings.html"><span
class="GUI">Job Settings</span> dialog box</a>. The arrow to the right opens
a menu, from which you can make settings or perform actions that are related to
the job. </p>
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/settings.png" />
<p>The menu items are described below.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="GUI">Job Settings</span>&mdash;Make and save settings for the
incorporation of the job into the Maestro project, the job name, the host,
the distribution of subjobs, and any other application-specific job settings.
Opens the <span class="GUI">Job Settings</span> dialog box.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Preferences</span>&mdash;Set general preferences for
running jobs. Opens the <span class="GUI">Preferences</span> panel at the <a
href="../maestro_menu/preferences.html#jobs_starting"><span class="GUI">Jobs - 
Starting</span> section</a>.</li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Read</span>&mdash;Opens the <span class="GUI">Jaguar
Read</span> file selector in which you can select a Jaguar input file to
read. The settings in the input file are applied to the panel if you choose to
read settings.
</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Maestro discards @, *, and # symbols when an input
file is read. This means that any counterpoise atoms, atoms for Hessian
refinement, and constraints that were set in the input file are no longer set.
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Write</span>&mdash;Opens the <span class="GUI">Jaguar
Write</span> file selector in which you can write out the input file or a 
batch file.
</p></li>
<li><span class="GUI">Edit</span>&mdash;Opens the <a href="edit_job.html"><span
class="GUI">Edit Job</span> dialog box</a>, in which you can edit the entire
input file or just the geometry (structure).
</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Reset Panel</span>&mdash;Reset the values in the panel to 
their defaults.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Job status</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>This icon indicates when there are jobs running for the application that
belong to the current project. It starts spinning when the first job starts, and
stops when there are no more jobs running. If a job fails to start, it changes
to an exclamation point. 
</p>
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/job_status.png" />
<p>
Clicking the button shows a small job status window that lists the job name and
status for all active jobs submitted from the current panel (for Jaguar and
MacroModel this means all jobs from any of the application panels). You can
double-click on a row to open the <a href="../misc/monitor_panel.html"><span
class="GUI">Monitor</span> panel</a> and monitor the job, or click the <span
class="GUI">Monitor</span> button to open the <span class="GUI">Monitor</span>
panel and close the job status window. The job status is updated while the
window is open. If a job finishes while the window is open, the job remains
displayed but with the new status.  The rows are colored according to the
status: yellow for submitted, green for launched, running, or finished, red for
incorporated, died, or killed.  Click anywhere outside the window to close it.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Run</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Run the job with the current job settings.
</p></dd>
</dl>
</dd>


<a name="status_bar"></a>
<dt>Status bar</dt>
<dd><p>The status bar displays information about the current job settings for the
panel. This includes the job name, task name and task settings (if any), number
of subjobs (if any) and the host name and job incorporation setting. It also
displays a message for a short time when you start a new job.</p>
<p>The status bar also contains the <span class="GUI">Help</span> button, which
opens the help topic for the panel.</p>
