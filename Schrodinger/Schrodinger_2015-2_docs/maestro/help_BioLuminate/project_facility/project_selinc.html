<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>In Maestro <i>selection</i> and <i>inclusion</i> are different concepts.</p>

<p>Selection is done on a row in the Project Table.  When you select a row, the
row is highlighted in a different color. Selection works in the same way and has
the same meaning as selection in tables in most graphical user interfaces.  A
selection forms the basis for most of the operations in the Project Table.  For
operations on large numbers of entries first you select all of the rows to
operate upon, then you specify the action.</p>

<p>Inclusion is the action of displaying an entry in the Workspace. The
inclusion state is specified by the icon in the <span class="GUI">In</span>
column of the Project Table.  The icon indicates whether the entry is included
into, excluded from, or fixed in the Workspace.</p>

<p> Clicking on a row selects that row.  Clicking in the <span
class="GUI">In</span> column changes that row's inclusion state.  Selecting 
a row (entry) does NOT change its inclusion state.</p>

<a name="sel"></a>
<h2>Entry Selection</h2>

<p>Entries can be selected and deselected directly from the Project Table in the
following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To select one entry and deselect all others, click in the
<span class="GUI">Row</span> column for the entry.</p></li>
<li><p>To select or deselect one row without affecting others, hold down the
<span class="Keys">Ctrl</span> key and click (&quot;control-click&quot;) in the
<span class="GUI">Row</span> column for the entry.</p></li>
<li><p>To select a contiguous range of entries, click in the
<span class="GUI">Row</span> column for the first entry in the range,
hold down the <span class="Keys">Shift</span> key and click
(&quot;shift-click&quot;) in the <span class="GUI">Row</span> column for the
last entry in the range.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If the entry is not selected, you can click anywhere in the row except the
<span class="GUI">In</span> column to select it. However, if the entry is
selected, clicking in any column other than the <span class="GUI">Row</span>
column or the <span class="GUI">In</span> column starts Edit mode for the
table cell. It is therefore recommended to always use the <span class="GUI">Row</span> column when selecting entries.</p>

<p>There are several other ways of including entries that meet certain criteria:
</p>
<ul>

<li><p>To select all entries, choose <span class="GUI">Select &rarr; All</span>, or press <span class="Keys">Ctrl+A</span> (<span class="Keys">&#x2318;A</span>).
</p></li>
<li><p>To clear the selection (deselect all entries), choose <span class="GUI">Select &rarr; None</span>, or press <span class="Keys">Ctrl+U</span> (<span class="Keys">&#x2318;U</span>).
</p></li>
<li><p>To invert the selection (select unselected entries, deselect selected
entries), choose <span class="GUI">Select &rarr; Invert</span>.
</p></li>
<li><p>To select all the entries in an entry group, click the entry group
row. Control-click a group row to add the group entries to the selection or
remove the group entries from the selection. </p></li>

<li><p>To select entries whose structures match a SMARTS pattern, choose
<span class="GUI">Select &rarr; By SMARTS</span>. See
the <a href="../pt_select_menu/select_by_smarts.html">Select by Smarts Panel</a>
topic for details.
</p></li>
<li><p>To select the same number or percentage of entries in each selected group,
starting either from the first or last entry in the group, choose
<span class="GUI">Select &rarr; From Groups</span>, and set the selection
in the <span class="GUI">Select from Groups</span> dialog box. Percentages are
rounded to the nearest number of entries, so it is possible for no entries to be
selected from a group. 
</p></li>
<li><p>To make a random selection of entries, choose
<span class="GUI">Select &rarr; Random</span>, and choose the number or
percentage of entries to select and the range of entries to select from, in the
<span class="GUI">Random Selection</span> dialog box. Percentages are rounded to
the nearest number of entries, so it is possible for no entries to be selected.
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>To perform more complex entry selection based on entry properties, use the
<a href="../pt_select_menu/esd.html"><span class="GUI">Entry Selection</span>
dialog box</a>. Choose <span class="GUI">Select &rarr; Only</span>,
<span class="GUI">Select &rarr; Add to selection</span>, or
<span class="GUI">Select &rarr; Deselect</span> to open this dialog box
and select only the rows specified, add the specified rows to the selection, or
delete the rows from the selection.</p>
<p>For example, to select only the entries that are included in the
Workspace:</p> 
<ol>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Select &rarr; Only</span> in the <span class="GUI">Project Table</span> panel. </p>
<p>The <span class="GUI">Entry Selection</span> dialog box opens.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Inclusion state</span> from the 
<span class="GUI">Property</span> list. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Select <span class="GUI">Included (or Fixed)</span></p>
</li>
<li><p>Click <span class="GUI">Add</span>, then click 
<span class="GUI">OK</span>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To add the Workspace entries to the selection, you would choose
<span class="GUI">Select &rarr; Add to selection</span> instead.
</p>
<p>You can also select entries from plots in the
<a href="../plot/scatter_plot.html">Scatter Plot Panel</a>. This is a useful
means of visually selecting entries on the basis of their properties. </p>
<a name="inc"></a>
<h2>Entry Inclusion</h2>

<p>Entries can be included, excluded, or fixed in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To include one entry and exclude all others, click the
<span class="GUI">In</span> column for that entry.</p></li>

<li><p>To include or exclude one entry without affecting others, hold down the
<span class="GUI">CTRL</span> key and click the
<span class="GUI">In</span> column for that entry.</p></li>

<li><p>To include a contiguous range of entries, click the
<span class="GUI">In</span> column for the first entry in the range,
hold down the <span class="GUI">SHIFT</span> key and click the
<span class="GUI">In</span> column for the last entry in the
range.</p></li>

<li><p>To include multiple entries in the Workspace and exclude all others,
first select the entries, then press 
<span class="Keys">Ctrl+N</span> (<span class="Keys">&#x2318;N</span>) or 
choose <span class="GUI">Entry &rarr; Include Only</span>.</p></li>

<li><p>To fix entries in the Workspace, first select the entries, then choose 
<span class="GUI">Entry &rarr; Fix</span>.
</p>
<p>You can make changes to entries that are fixed in the Workspace. Fixing an
entry only means that it remains in the Workspace until you explicitly exclude
it, with <span class="GUI">Entry &rarr; Unfix</span>.</p>
<p>Fixed entries are marked with a padlock icon in the 
<span class="GUI">In</span> column of the <span class="GUI">Project Table</span>
panel or <span class="GUI">Entry List</span> panel.</p>
</li> 

<li><p>To exclude multiple entries from the Workspace, first select the entries,
then press <span class="Keys">Ctrl+X</span> (<span class="Keys">&#x2318;X</span>) or choose  <span class="GUI">Entry &rarr; Exclude</span>.
</p></li>

<li><p>To include the next (or previous) selected entry in the Workspace and
exclude the current entry, press the <span class="Keys">Right Arrow</span>
(or <span class="Keys">Left Arrow</span>) key. If there are multiple entries
included in the Workspace, the action is applied to all of the included
entries. This is a useful way of stepping through one or more set of entries,
displaying them in turn in the Workspace.
</p></li>

</ul>

<p>You can also include entries from plots in the
<a href="../plot/scatter_plot.html">Scatter Plot Panel</a>. This is a useful
means of choosing entries for inclusion on the basis of their properties. </p>

<p>If you choose to include a large number of entries in the Workspace, a
warning dialog box is displayed, as there is a risk that the inclusion will take
up too much memory and degrade performance or freeze Maestro altogether. This is
particularly likely if the entries have large numbers of atoms, such as
proteins. You can set the number of entries at which the warning is displayed in
this dialog box, and you can choose to continue or to cancel the inclusion. Once
the inclusion starts, a progress dialog box is displayed if the inclusion takes
more than a few seconds. You can stop the include operation in this dialog box
at the last entry included by clicking <code>Stop</code> or pressing the <span
class="Keys">Esc</span> key.
</p>

<h2>An Example</h2>

<p>Suppose you want to include into the Workspace
all of the entries that start with the name "ligand".  This is done
by first selecting the entries and then including only the selected entries.</p>

<p>
To select all of the rows whose title starts with "ligand" (assume the titles are
ligand1, ligand2, etc.):</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Select &rarr; Only</span>
to open the <span class="GUI">Entry Selection</span> dialog box.</p></li>

<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Title</span> from the
<span class="GUI">Properties</span> list.</p></li>

<li><p>Select <span class="GUI">Matches</span> and enter
<tt>ligand*</tt> in the text box. </p></li>

<li><p>Click <span class="GUI">Add</span>
then click <span class="GUI">OK</span>.</p></li>

<li><p>From the <span class="GUI">Entry</span> menu choose
<span class="GUI">Include Only</span>.  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>The entries that are in the selection are included in the Workspace
and all other entries are excluded.</p>
