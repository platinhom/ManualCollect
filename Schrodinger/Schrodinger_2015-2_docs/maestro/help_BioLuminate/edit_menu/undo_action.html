<h2>Undoing an Action</h2>

<p> The <span class="GUI">Undo</span> command returns the structure in the
Maestro Workspace to the state it was in prior to the last undoable command. 
</p> 

<p>To undo an action, click the <span class="GUI">Undo/Redo</span> button on the 
<span class="GUI">Edit</span> toolbar, 
or choose <span class="GUI">Edit &rarr; Undo alias</span> <i>action</i>
in the main window, where <i>action</i> is the last action for which Maestro
supports an undo.</p>

<p>Maestro provides a single level undo for any operation that results in a
chemical change in a displayed structure. In addition, several other types of
actions are undoable. The last operation for which the undo option is available
appears on the <span class="GUI">Edit</span> menu. Note that there is no panel
associated with this menu item. An undo takes place immediately.</p>

<p>Each <span class="GUI">Undo</span> command has a corresponding
<span class="GUI">Redo</span> command. Once an 
<span class="GUI">Undo</span> has been executed, the 
<span class="GUI">Redo</span> option appears in the 
<span class="GUI">Undo</span> command's place, and the
direction of the arrow on the <span class="GUI">Undo</span> 
toolbar button is reversed. </p>
