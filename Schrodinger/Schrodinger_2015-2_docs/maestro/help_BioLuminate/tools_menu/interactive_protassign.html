<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
This panel is used to interactively assign orientations of hydrogen-bonded
groups in proteins (including waters) and of the imidazole ring in His and the
terminal amides in Asn and Gln. 
</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Interactive H-Bond Optimizer Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Interactive H-Bond Optimizer</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Click <span class="GUI">Interactive Optimizer</span> in the 
<span class="GUI">Refine</span> tab of the <span class="GUI">Protein Preparation Wizard</span> panel.</p></li>
<li><p>Click <span class="GUI">Optimize H-Bond Networks</span> in the 
<span class="GUI">PrimeX</span> panel.</p></li>
</ul>


<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Interactive H-Bond Optimizer Panel</h2> 


<p>
This panel can be used from the Protein Preparation Wizard panel to check on the
assigmnents of hydrogen orientations in the hydrogen-bonding network and the
His, Asn, and Gln orientations. Each hydrogen bond donor, His ring, and Asn and
Gln terminal amide is considered a separate orientable species.

<a name="feature0"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Analysis</span> section</dt>
<dd><p>In this section you perform the analysis of the system into
hydrogen-bonded clusters.  
</p>
<dl>
<dt><span class="GUI">pH</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>Set the pH value for determining the protonation state of protein
residues. </p>
</dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Use PROPKA</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Use PROPKA to predict the p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> values of the protein
and determine the protonation state at the specified pH. If you deselect this
option, a set of simple rules is used to determine the protonation states
according to the pH range:</p>
<ul>
<li>very low&mdash;protonate ASP, GLU, HIS</li>
<li>low&mdash;protonate HIS</li>
<li>neutral&mdash;normal biological states</li>
<li>high&mdash;deprotonate CYS</li>
</ul>

<dd><p>Label protein atoms with their predicted p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> values.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Analyze Network</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Analyze the hydrogen bonds in the structure, subject to the options that
are selected in this section, to generate the species and clusters and their
states, which are then listed in the table. You must click this button when you
first open the panel, or if you add or delete bonds or atoms in the Workspace or
include a new structure in the Workspace.  The analysis can take a minute or so,
depending on the size of the system.
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Include current orientations</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Include the current orientations of the hydrogen-bonded species among the
orientations to be sampled.
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Only treat Workspace selection</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Restrict the scope of the analysis to the atoms that are selected in the
Workspace.
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Use crystal symmetry</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>When analyzing the Workspace structure, use crystal symmetry to include
in the analysis any H-bonds to atoms in neighboring cells. This can be important
if only part of the biologically-relevant structure is present in the asymmetric
unit. Using this option can significantly increase the time taken in the
optimization.
</p></dd>

</dl>

</dd>

<a name="feature1"></a>
<dt>View options</dt>
<dd><p>There are two options for display of species in the species table, with
relevant controls. The content of the species table depends on the option that
is selected.
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="GUI">View all species</span>&mdash;list all species in the
table. The number of species is given to the right of this option.
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">View cluster</span>&mdash;list the species for the
specified cluster in the table. You can enter the desired cluster number in the
text box, use the arrow buttons to step through clusters one at a time, or use
the double-arrow buttons to go to the beginning or end of the cluster list. The
number of clusters is given to the right of this option. When you select a
cluster, the Workspace view zooms in to the cluster, its carbon atoms are
colored green, and any alterations to the state are labeled. The H-bonds in and
to the cluster are also shown in the Workspace.
</p></li>
</ul>
</dd>

<a name="feature2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Fit to Workspace</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>This button zooms in on the cluster so that the cluster fills the
Workspace.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Optimize</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Optimize the orientations of the species listed in the table. When the
optimization has finished, the <span class="GUI">Display result</span> controls
become available, and the best-scoring result is displayed.
</p></dd>
<a name="feature8"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Display result</span> text box and buttons</dt>
<dd><p>The text box shows the index of the result that is displayed in the
Workspace. The index starts from 0, for the lowest (best) score, and the results
are ordered by score. To change the display, you can enter an index in the text
box, or use the arrow buttons to step through the results. When you change the
result that is displayed, the orientation of the species in the Workspace is
changed, and the <span class="GUI">State</span> column of the species table is
updated to indicate which state of each species is represented in the chosen
result. The score for the result is displayed to the right of the text box, and
is updated as you step through results for the cluster or manually change the
state via the species table.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature4"></a>
<dt>Species table</dt>
<dd><p>This table lists the orientable species for the choice of view made at
the top of the panel. The table is noneditable, but can be used to select a
species to change its orientation. You can select a single row of the table to
adjust the orientation of the species. When you select a row, the species is
centered in the Workspace and the view zooms in to that species, whose carbon
atoms are colored green, and a label is added if its orientation has changed.
The <span class="GUI">UP ARROW</span> and <span class="GUI">DOWN ARROW</span>
keys can be used move the selection up and down the table. </p>
<p>The table is deactivated if you delete or add atoms or bonds in the
Workspace. The species and their states can be recalculated by using the 
<span class="GUI">Analyze Network</span> button. 
</p>
<p>The table columns are as follows:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td>#
</td>
<td>&nbsp;
</td>
<td>Index of species, relative to the full list or the cluster, depending on the
choice of view option.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span class="GUI">Lock</span>
</td>
<td>&nbsp;
</td>
<td>Option to lock the orientation of the species at the current state. The
space bar can be used to lock or unlock the orientation. When you lock the
orientation, it is not changed when you click <span class="GUI">Optimize</span>.  
If you manually change the state, the lock does not lock the manually-adjusted
state but the original state. You can add a manually-adjusted state to the set
of states for the species with the <span class="GUI">Add Orientation</span> button.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span class="GUI">Species</span>
</td>
<td>&nbsp;
</td>
<td>Identity of species, given as the chain name followed by a colon, the
residue name and number, and another colon and the atom name if a rotatable
hydrogen is involved. 
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span class="GUI">State</span>
</td>
<td>&nbsp;
</td>
<td>This column indicates the state of the species: 
<ul>
<li>For GLN and ASN, the two states are <span class="GUI">Flip</span> and <span
class="GUI">No Flip</span>, which describe how the orientation of the terminal
amide has changed from the input structure.
</li>
<li>For HIS, the protonation state is given by the residue name, preceded by
the word Flip if the orientation of the ring has changed from the input structure.
</li>
<li>For hydrogens, the states is described by <span class="GUI">Orientation
</span><i>i</i>/<i>n</i>, where <i>i</i> is the index of the particular orientation,
and <i>n</i> is the number of orientations.
</li>
</ul>
</td>

<dd><p>Adds the current orientation of the species to the list of states. The
states added using this button are labeled <span

adjustments included for sampling and locking. The button is only available for
rotatable hydrogens and waters.

<dt><span class="GUI">Sort by State</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Sort the table by the values in the <span class="GUI">State</span>

<a name="feature6"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Pick to locate species</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Select this option to pick an atom in the Workspace that belongs to a
