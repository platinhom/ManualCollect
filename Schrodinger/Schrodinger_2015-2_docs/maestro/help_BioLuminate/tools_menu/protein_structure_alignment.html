<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Use this panel when you would like to bring two or more
proteins into a common frame of reference
by structurally aligning (superimposing) them.</p>

<p>It is often difficult to superimpose protein structures.
Reasons include:</p>
<ul>
<li>low structural similarity</li>
<li>low (or no) sequence identity</li>
<li>a different number of residues</li>
<li>different sequence numbering</li>
</ul>

<p>This panel greatly facilitates the superimposition of protein structures
with an algorithm that attempts to align secondary structure elements.</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Protein Structure Alignment Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Protein Structure Alignment</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Tools &rarr; Protein Structure Alignment</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
</ul>


<p>This panel is dockable, so it opens by default in the Workspace. You can
change this behavior in the <a href="../maestro_menu/preferences.html"><span
class="GUI">Preferences</span> panel</a>, under <span class="GUI">General
&ndash; Panels</span>.
</p>

<h2>Using the Protein Structure Alignment Panel</h2> 


<p>Structure alignment operates on Project Table entries that have been included
in the Workspace or are selected in the Project Table.  Include in the Workspace
or select two or more protein structures, open the <span class="GUI">Protein
Structure Alignment</span> panel, and click <span class="GUI">Align</span> to
start the alignment calculation.  The structure that is the first entry (lowest
row number) in the Project Table is used for the frame of reference; to use a
different protein's frame of reference, move that protein to the first entry in
the Project Table before starting the alignment job.</p>

<p>By default, the alignment includes all residues. However, it is often useful
to align a subset of residues that have greater similarity than the structures
as a whole, or are more informative to compare.  Because this program uses
matching of secondary structure elements, the subset should have enough
contiguous residues to include at least one helix or strand. Very small numbers
of residues do not produce useful alignments. </p>

<p>You might need to try different subsets to obtain the most useful alignment.
You can use the picking controls, choose a predefined set of atoms from the
selection button menu, or open the <span class="GUI">Atom Selection</span>
dialog box (ASD) to specify subsets. In this dialog box you can select a range
of residue numbers, specify portions of the residue sequence, or click <span
class="GUI">Secondary Structure</span> in the list of options on the left to
choose residues based on their location in <span class="GUI">Helix</span>, <span
class="GUI">Strand</span>, or <span class="GUI">Loop</span> structures. It might
also be helpful to display the sequence viewer with the secondary structure
assignment, and pick residues in the sequence viewer.
</p>

<p>When the alignment calculation is complete, the structures are placed in the
same frame of reference in the Workspace, and the results of the calculation are
displayed in the <span class="GUI">Protein Structure Alignment Results</span>
panel.  The aligned residues are listed and an <span class="GUI">RMSD</span> and
<span class="GUI">Alignment Score</span> are reported. The <span
class="GUI">RMSD</span> is calculated based only on those residues that are
considered to have been successfully aligned, and therefore does not represent
an overall comparison of the structures.  An <span class="GUI">Alignment
Score</span> greater than about 0.7, or a failure of the structural alignment
calculation, indicates there is insufficient structural similarity for a
meaningful alignment.</p>

<p>The RMSD and the alignment score are also added to the structures as Maestro
properties, <span class="GUI">StructAlign RMSD</span>
(<code>r_psp_StructAlign_RMSD</code>) and <span class="GUI">StructAlign
Score</span> (<code>r_psp_StructAlign_Score</code>).

<dd><p>Choose the source of the proteins to align, from <span
class="GUI">Workspace (included entries)</span> or <span class="GUI">Project
Table (selected entries)</span>. The proteins are aligned to the frame of the
project entry that has the smallest row number. 
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Reference residues</span> picking controls</dt>
<dd><p>Specify the residues in the reference protein to which the other proteins
will be aligned, using the standard <a
href="../misc/picking_controls.html">picking tools</a>. You should specify
residues that contain at least one secondary structure element. You must pick
residues in the reference protein, which is the project entry with the smallest
row number (highest in the table). A warning is displayed if you pick residues
in another protein. 
</p></dd>

<a name="feature3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Residues to align</span> options and picking controls</dt>
<dd><p>Specify the residues in the other proteins that are to be aligned to the
reference residue set. If you want to use the same residue definitions as for
the reference, choose <span class="GUI">Use same ASL as reference
residues</span>. If you want to define a different set of residues, choose <span
class="GUI">Use separate ASL</span>, and specify the residues with the <span

The <span class="GUI">Protein Structure Alignment Results</span> panel opens,
showing the text &quot;Calculating alignment...&quot; until the alignment is
done, when the text is replaced by the results. The text in the results panel is
replaced each time you click <span class="GUI">Align</span>.
