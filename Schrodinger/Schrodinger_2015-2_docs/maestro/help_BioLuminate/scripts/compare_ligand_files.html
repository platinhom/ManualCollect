<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Compare two sets of structures, either from files or selected entries in the
Project Table, and return those structures that either occur in both sets,
occur only in the first set and not the second, occur in only one of the
sets, or occur in either set, without duplicates. The comparison is based on
titles, SMILES strings, or connectivity.</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Compare Ligand Files Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Compare Ligand Files</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Tasks &rarr; Scripts &rarr; Interfaces and Automation &rarr; Compare Ligand Files</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
</ul>

<a name="feature1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">First structure set</span> options</dt>
<dd><p>Select an option for specifying the first structure set:
</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="GUI">File</span>&mdash;Use the specified file as the first
structure set. Enter the file name in the text box, or
click <span class="GUI">Browse</span> and navigate to the file.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Selected entries</span>&mdash;Use the entries that are
selected in the Project Table as the first structure set. If you choose this
option for the first set, you should not choose it for the second set.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<a name="feature2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Second structure set</span> options</dt>
<dd><p>
</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="GUI">File</span>&mdash;Use the specified file as the second
structure set. Enter the file name in the text box, or
click <span class="GUI">Browse</span> and navigate to the file.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Selected entries</span>&mdash;Use the entries that are
selected in the Project Table as the second structure set. If you choose this
option for the second set, you should not choose it for the first set.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<a name="feature3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Save</span> options</dt>
<dd><p>Select an option for the structures to save in the output file:
</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="GUI">Structures from the first set that are not in the second
set</span>&mdash;Keep the structures from the first set that do not match any
of the structures in the second set. </li>
<li><span class="GUI">Structures from the first set that are also present in the
second set</span>&mdash;Keep the structures from the first set that match
structures in the second set. These are the structures that are the same in both
sets.</li> 
<li><span class="GUI">Structures that occur only in one set but not the
other</span>&mdash;Keep the structures from each set that are not in both
sets. These are the structures that differ between the sets. This is the logical
complement of the previous option.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">All structures from the first set plus all structures from
the second set that are not also in the first set</span>&mdash;Combine the sets
and eliminate duplicates, keeping only the copy from the first set for
structures that are the same in both sets.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<a name="feature4"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Criteria</span> options</dt>
<dd><p>Select an option for the criterion used to decide whether a structure
from the first set is the same as a structure from the second set:
</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="GUI">Property</span>Structures that have the same value of the
property specified in the text box are considered the same. The internal name of
the property must be used.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">SMILES</span>Structures that have the same SMILES pattern
are considered the same. The SMILES pattern is generated automatically.</li> 
<li><span class="GUI">Tautomer</span>&mdash;Structures that are tautomers (or
have identical connectivity) are considered the same.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<a name="feature5"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Do not return multiple copies of each structure</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Select this option to ensure that only one copy of each structure appears
in the output file. Although the <span class="GUI">Save</span> options ensure
that duplication between the two sets is eliminated, they do not eliminate
duplicates within each set. This option ensures that duplicates within the sets
are also eliminated.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature6"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Don't analyze the first structure from the input files (receptor)</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Select this option to skip the first structure in each set. This is
useful when the file is a pose viewer file, or an entry group is chosen with a
receptor as the first entry. As this option is applied to both sets, you must
ensure that the first entry in each set should be ignored.

<a name="job_toolbar"></a>
<dt>Job toolbar</dt>
<dd><p>The Job toolbar is used to make settings for a job and to start it. </p>

<dl>
<dt><span class="GUI">Job name</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>Enter a name for the job in this text box.
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Settings</span> button menu</dt>
<dd><p>This button opens the <a href="../misc/job_settings.html"><span
class="GUI">Job Settings</span> dialog box</a>. The arrow to the right opens
a menu, from which you can make settings or perform actions that are related to
the job. </p>
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/settings.png" />
<p>The menu items are described below.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="GUI">Job Settings</span>&mdash;Make and save settings for the
incorporation of the job into the Maestro project, the job name, the host,
the distribution of subjobs, and any other application-specific job settings.
Opens the <span class="GUI">Job Settings</span> dialog box.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Preferences</span>&mdash;Set general preferences for
running jobs. Opens the <span class="GUI">Preferences</span> panel at the <a
href="../maestro_menu/preferences.html#jobs_starting"><span class="GUI">Jobs - 
Starting</span> section</a>.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Job status</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>This icon indicates when there are jobs running for the application that
belong to the current project. It starts spinning when the first job starts, and
stops when there are no more jobs running. If a job fails to start, it changes
to an exclamation point. 
</p>
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/job_status.png" />
<p>
Clicking the button shows a small job status window that lists the job name and
status for all active jobs submitted from the current panel (for Jaguar and
MacroModel this means all jobs from any of the application panels). You can
double-click on a row to open the <a href="../misc/monitor_panel.html"><span
class="GUI">Monitor</span> panel</a> and monitor the job, or click the <span
class="GUI">Monitor</span> button to open the <span class="GUI">Monitor</span>
panel and close the job status window. The job status is updated while the
window is open. If a job finishes while the window is open, the job remains
displayed but with the new status.  The rows are colored according to the
status: yellow for submitted, green for launched, running, or finished, red for
incorporated, died, or killed.  Click anywhere outside the window to close it.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Run</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Run the job with the current job settings.
</p></dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<a name="status_bar"></a>
<dt>Status bar</dt>
<dd><p>The status bar displays information about the current job settings for the
panel. This includes the job name, task name and task settings (if any), number
of subjobs (if any) and the host name and job incorporation setting. It also
displays a message for a short time when you start a new job.</p>
<p>The status bar also contains the <span class="GUI">Help</span> button, which
opens the help topic for the panel.</p>
