<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>In this panel you can connect to a KNIME session, and send and receive
structures and their properties from that session. 
</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Structure Exchange with KNIME Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Structure Exchange with KNIME</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Tasks &rarr; KNIME Workflows &rarr; Establish Structure Exchange with KNIME</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
</ul>


<p>This panel is dockable, so it opens by default in the Workspace. You can
change this behavior in the <a href="../maestro_menu/preferences.html"><span
class="GUI">Preferences</span> panel</a>, under <span class="GUI">General
&ndash; Panels</span>.
</p>

<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Structure Exchange with KNIME Panel</h2> 


<p>This panel can be used to transfer structures and their properties between
Maestro and KNIME. The KNIME workflow must include KNIME-Maestro Connector
nodes, each of which can communicate with Maestro. The use of these connector
nodes enables you to make changes to the structures in Maestro and send them
back to KNIME.
</p>

<p><b>To set up the connection:</b>
</p>

<ol>
<li><p>In Maestro, choose <span class="GUI">Workflows &rarr; KNIME &rarr;
Establish Structure Exchange with KNIME</span>.
</p></li>
<li><p>Click <span class="GUI">Start</span> to start the KNIME-Maestro
connection server. 
</p></li>
<li><p>Start KNIME and load the workflow you want to run.
</p></li>
</ol>

<p><b>To send structures to a node:</b>
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Choose the source of structures from the <span class="GUI">Structures to
send</span> option menu, and select or include the relevant structures.
</p></li>
<li><p>Select the node that you want to send the structures to in the <span
class="GUI">KNIME nodes connected</span> list. 
</p></li>
<li><p>Click <span class="GUI">Send</span>. 
</p></li>
</ol>

<p>When a connector node is run, the input structures to that node are added to
the Project Table in Maestro, and the node is added to the <span
class="GUI">KNIME nodes connected</span> list. Execution of the node halts until
you send structures to it, by selecting the node in the list and clicking
<span class="GUI">Send</span>. If the node has no input, when it is
executed it waits until you send structures from Maestro to it. Once the
structure has been sent, the node is automatically disconnected. You can also
disconnect the node manually if no structure is needed from Maestro, by
selecting it in the list and clicking <span class="GUI">Disconnect</span>.

<a name="feature1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Server</span> buttons</dt>
<dd><p>Click <span class="GUI">Start</span> to start the KNIME-Maestro
connection server. This is a special server that handles the communication
between Maestro and KNIME. Click <span class="GUI">Stop</span> to stop the
server. After you start the server, it continues to run (even when the panel is
closed), and can receive requests from any KNIME session. The server is
automatically shut down when you quit Maestro. 
</p></dd>

<a name="feature2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">KNIME nodes connected</span> list</dt>
<dd><p>List of KNIME nodes that are ready to receive structures from Maestro
(connected). Nodes are added when they are executed, and the input structures to
the node are placed in the Project Table (if it has input). Nodes are removed
from the list when structures are sent or they are disconnected manually. You
can select a single node in the list to perform an action on. 
</p></dd>

<a name="feature3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Disconnect</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Disconnect the node that is selected in the list.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature5"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Structures to send</span> option menu</dt>
<dd><p>Choose the source of structures to be sent to a KNIME node. You can send
the structures in the Workspace (included entries) or the selected entries in
the Project Table.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature4"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Send</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Send the structures designated on the <span class="GUI">Structures to
send</span> option menu to the node that is selected in the list. Properties are
sent as well as structures, as the structures are exported as a Maestro file to
be used by the KNIME node.
