<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Predict the conformation of side chains in one or more proteins by sampling
orientations to minimize the energy. The sampling can include the orientation
with respect to the backbone, and sampling of the backbone as well. The sampling
can be run with periodic boundary conditions, in implicit solvent, and with an
implicit membrane.
</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Predict Side Chains Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Predict Side Chains</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Tasks &rarr; Loop + Sidechain Prediction &rarr; Predict Side Chains</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
</ul>


<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Predict Side Chains Panel</h2> 


<p>When selecting residues for side-chain prediction, you might want to use the 
<a href="../misc/asd.html"><span class="GUI">Atom Selection</span> dialog
box</a>, which provides proximity options that allow you to select all
residues within a certain distance of a ligand, for example.</p>

<p>If you imported a PDB structure that has residues with missing atoms, you can
select those residues by clicking <span class="GUI">Select Residues with Missing
Atoms</span>. The selection is based on the information generated when the
structure was imported, and does not use the current structural information.
The selection therefore includes any residues that were fixed since import.
</p>
<p>
If you are refining a homology model, you should consider refining residues
whose side-chain coordinates did not come from the templates. These are residues
for which the <span class="GUI">Homology Status</span> is equal to 1 and 2. The 
backbone coordinates for residues with a <span class="GUI">Homology
Status</span> of 1 were taken from the templates, but not the side chain
coordinates. For residues with a <span class="GUI">Homology Status</span> of 2
(none of the coordinates came from the templates), you should consider doing a
loop refinement first. You can select all residues with non-template side
chains by clicking <span class="GUI">Select Non-Conserved Residues</span>.

<ul>
<li><span class="GUI">Job Settings</span>&mdash;Make and save settings for the
incorporation of the job into the Maestro project, the job name, the host,
the distribution of subjobs, and any other application-specific job settings.
Opens the <span class="GUI">Job Settings</span> dialog box.</li>

</p>
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/job_status.png" />
<p>
Clicking the button shows a small job status window that lists the job name and
status for all active jobs submitted from the current panel (for Jaguar and
MacroModel this means all jobs from any of the application panels). You can
double-click on a row to open the <a href="../misc/monitor_panel.html"><span
class="GUI">Monitor</span> panel</a> and monitor the job, or click the <span
class="GUI">Monitor</span> button to open the <span class="GUI">Monitor</span>
panel and close the job status window. The job status is updated while the
window is open. If a job finishes while the window is open, the job remains
displayed but with the new status.  The rows are colored according to the
status: yellow for submitted, green for launched, running, or finished, red for
incorporated, died, or killed.  Click anywhere outside the window to close it.

<dd><p>The status bar displays information about the current job settings for the
panel. This includes the job name, task name and task settings (if any), number
of subjobs (if any) and the host name and job incorporation setting. It also
displays a message for a short time when you start a new job.</p>
