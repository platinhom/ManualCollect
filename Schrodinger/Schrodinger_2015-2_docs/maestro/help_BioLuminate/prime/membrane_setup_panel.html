<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
This panel is used to set up an implicit membrane model for Prime refinement calculations.
</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Prime Membrane Setup Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Prime Membrane Setup</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Click <span class="GUI">Set Up Membrane</span> in the 
<span class="GUI">Options</span> dialog box of any of the Prime refinement panels.</p></li>
</ul>


<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Prime Membrane Setup Panel</h2> 


<p>The implicit membrane is a slab-shaped region with a low dielectric constant,
similar to the implicit solvent region. The low dielectric constant removes
the penalties incurred by hydrophobic groups in the solvent region, and also
removes the rewards gained by hydrophilic groups in the solvent region.
</p>

<p>The membrane is marked in the Workspace by a semitransparent cube with a
white line that is perpendicular to the surfaces of the membrane (which are
planar). The membrane surfaces are colored red, and the other faces of the cube
(which are interior to the membrane) are colored green. You can control whether
the sides of the cube are displayed with the <span class="GUI">Show cube
sides</span> option. The direction of the line shows the orientation of the
membrane.You can adjust both the thickness and the orientation of the membrane.
</p>

<p>The implicit membrane model is intended for use with proteins that span the
membrane. The slab is trimmed for efficiency, so that any structure that is too
small or too far away from the membrane is likely to result in too much
trimming and might not produce useful results. </p>

<p>If the protein has pockets that would be occupied by solvent (water), you can
select these regions to exclude from the implicit membrane using the tools in
the <span class="GUI">Region to exclude from membrane</span> section. The
solvent dielectric constant is then used for these excluded regions.</p>

<dl>

<a name="feature1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Place Membrane</span> section</dt>
<dd><p>This section provides tools for initial placement of the membrane.
The orientation and thickness of the membrane is indicated in the Workspace by
a cube and a white line that is perpendicular to the plane of the membrane.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><span class="GUI">Load from Selected Entry</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Load a membrane from the entry that is selected in the Project Table. The
membrane is placed at the same location in space as in the source entry, so you
should ensure that the protein in the source entry and the current entry are
properly positioned.
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Place on an OPM Structure</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>If you have a structure from the OPM database, click this button to place
the membrane according to the information stored with the structure. If you
click this button without having an OPM structure, the membrane is placed
symmetrically on the <i>z</i> axis.
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Place by ASL</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Click this button to place the membrane so that the atoms given by the
expression in the <span class="GUI">ASL</span> text box are inside the
membrane. The ASL expression can be entered in the text box, 
or you can click <span class="GUI">Select</span> to specify the atoms in the <a 
href="../misc/asd.html"><span class="GUI">Atom Selection</span> dialog box</a>,
or click <span class="GUI">Set to Helices</span> to use the secondary structure
assignment to select the helices for placement inside the membrane. 
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">ASL</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>ASL expression for the atoms to place inside the memrane. You can type an
expression into this text box directly, or use the <span
class="GUI">Select</span> or <span class="GUI">Set to Helices</span> buttons to
enter an expression.
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Select</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Opens the <a href="../misc/asd.html"><span class="GUI">Atom
Selection</span> dialog box</a>, so you can define the atoms to place inside the
membrane.
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Set to Helices</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Set the expression in the <span class="GUI">ASL</span> text box to
<span class="GUI">res.sec helix</span>. This expression selects all residues for
which the secondary structure assignment is to a helix, and requires that a
secondary structure assignment has been made (e.g. with <span class="GUI">Tools
&rarr; Assign Secondary Structure</span>).
</p></dd>
</dl>

</dd>

<a name="feature2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Adjust membrane</span> section</dt>
<dd><p>This section provides tools for adjusting the membrane position and
thickness. 
</p>
<dl>
<dt><span class="GUI">Thickness</span> text box and arrow buttons</dt>
<dd><p>Use the text box and arrow buttons to adjust the thickness of the
membrane. You can enter text into the text box. The arrow buttons perform fine
adjustments, at the 0.1&nbsp;&Aring; level.
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Adjust membrane position</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Select this option to adjust the position of the membrane. You can then
rotate and translate the membrane in the same way as you do with structures,
using the middle and right mouse buttons. When you have finished, deselect this
option to resume normal Workspace operations.
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Show cube sides</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Select this option to show the sides of the cube that defines the
membrane. The location of the sides is not significant, it is only an aid to
visualizing the membrane location.
</p></dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<a name="feature3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Exclude region from membrane</span> section</dt>
<dd><p>In this section you can set up regions to be excluded from the membrane
that are considered to be solvent-occupied regions in the protein. The solvent
dielectric constant is used in these regions. 
</p>

<dl>
<dt><span class="GUI">Place or edit exclusion spheres</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Select this option to pick atoms in the Workspace on which exclusion
spheres will be placed, or for which you want to change the radius. The spheres
are displayed in semitransparent green in the Workspace. The spheres should
cover the region to be excluded from the membrane, and may overlap the
protein. Picking an atom that has a sphere allows you to change the radius or to
delete the sphere.
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Radius</span> slider</dt>
<dd><p>Set the radius of the selected sphere. This radius is also applied to
newly placed spheres. The exact radius is not important, as long as the
overlapping spheres cover the exclusion region.
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Delete Current Sphere</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Delete the current sphere.
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Delete All Spheres</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Delete all exclusion spheres.
</p></dd>
</dl>

</dd>

<a name="feature4"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Save to Selected Entries</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Add the membrane to the entries that are selected in the Project
Table. The membrane is stored as a set of coordinates, for each end of the white
line. The entries that you select should therefore contain proteins that occupy
approximately the same region of space as the protein used to define the
membrane. Otherwise, you will have to adjust the membrane location for these
entries.
