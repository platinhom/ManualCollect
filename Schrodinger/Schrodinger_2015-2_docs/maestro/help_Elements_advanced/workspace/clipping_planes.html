<p>The Clipping Planes window is located in the lower-right corner of the
Workspace. By default, it is not displayed. You can display it by choosing
<span class="GUI">Workspace &rarr; Clipping Planes</span>.

<p>&quot;Clipping&quot; is used to automatically limit the parts of a structure
that are displayed in the Workspace. This is done by defining <i>clipping
planes</i>, and displaying only the parts of the graphical image that are
between these planes. Anything that is in front of or behind these planes is not
displayed. Clipping can be useful when working with large structures containing
many atoms, in which it can be hard to see certain atoms and even harder to pick
those atoms.</p>

<p>The display in the clipping planes window consists of the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Top view of structures:</b> A representation of the structures in the
Workspace, drawn in the wire frame representation. The view of the structures is
from the top, that is, from the  positive <i>y</i> direction looking down to the
negative <i>y</i> direction. Thus, the back of the structure is in the upper
part of this window while the front is in the lower part of this window. 
</p>
<p>Translation in <i>y</i> doesn't affect the display, but <i>x</i> and
<i>z</i>-translation moves the displayed structures.</p>
<p>By default, the structures are displayed at the same size regardless of
zoom. You can, however, zoom in on the top view by setting a preference in the
<a href="../maestro_menu/preferences.html#workspace_clipping"><span
class="GUI">Preferences</span> panel</a>, to zoom in on the top view whenever
zooming in the Workspace.
</p></li>
<li><p><b>Clipping planes:</b> These are horizontal lines that mark the planes
where the graphical image is clipped. The lower line marks the plane that is
closest to the viewer, and the upper line is furthest from the viewer. The
planes can be moved by dragging the horizontal lines. </p>
<p>To move both planes simultaneously in the same direction (i.e. in parallel),
hold down the <span class="GUI">CTRL</span> key and drag one of the planes or
use the mouse wheel.</p>
<p>To move both planes in opposite directions,
hold down the <span class="GUI">SHIFT</span> key and drag one of the planes or
use the mouse wheel.</p>
<p>
The clipping planes are automatically adjusted with any of the following
actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select part of a structure and perform a fit to Workspace.</li>
<li>Middle-click a residue in the sequence viewer to zoom in on it.</li>
<li>Select a rotamer in the <span class="GUI">Residues</span> table of the
<a href="../edit_menu/rotamers_db.html"><span class="GUI">Rotamers</span> dialog
box</a>.</li>
<li>Find a residue using the <a href="../workspace/find_toolbar.html"><span class="GUI">Find</span> toolbar</a>.</li>
<li>Fit a ligand to the Workspace (<span class="GUI">Workspace &rarr; Fit to Workspace &rarr; Ligand</span>).
</li>
</ul>
<p>All but the first of these are controlled by a preference in the 
<a href="../maestro_menu/preferences.html#workspace_clipping"><span
class="GUI">Workspace &ndash; Clipping planes</span> tab</a> of the <span
class="GUI">Preferences</span> panel. To zoom out again, ensure that nothing is
selected in the Workspace, and perform a fit to Workspace.
</p>

</li>
<li><p><b>Viewing volume indicator</b>: This is a green box that represents the
viewing volume. As you zoom in on the structure, the box shrinks. If you have
perspective enabled, the viewing volume box is trapezoidal, with the small side
at the bottom.
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Clipping can be applied selectively, as well as to all graphical objects.
To choose what clipping is applied to, right-click in the clipping planes
window and make your choice from the shortcut menu that is displayed.
The choices are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="GUI">All</span>&mdash;Apply clipping to all objects
(structures and surfaces). Clipping planes are drawn as horizontal orange
lines, and can be adjusted by dragging.
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Surfaces</span>&mdash; Apply clipping to surfaces
but not to structures. There are four clipping planes: front, back, left,
and right. These planes are drawn as horizontal and vertical purple lines,
and can be adjusted by dragging.</p>
<p>If you want to clip individual surfaces, you could instead consider using the
<span class="GUI">Limit</span> feature for the surface. See the <a
href="../surfaces/limit_surface_panel.html">Limit Surface Panel</a> topic for
more information.
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Surfaces to selected atoms</span>&mdash; Apply clipping
to the surfaces using a cube centered on the selected atoms.  For example, you
might select just the ligand in a ligand-receptor complex, and the surface will
be clipped to a cube that contains the ligand. The outline of the cube is
displayed in cyan. You can resize the cube by dragging horizontally.
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Selected atoms</span>&mdash;Apply clipping only to the
selected atoms. For example, you could select the receptor in a complex, and
leave the ligand unclipped. Clipping planes are drawn as horizontal cyan lines,
and can be adjusted by dragging.
</p></li>
</ul>
