<p>The sequence viewer displays the sequence of the proteins that are included in
the Workspace. Each chain is displayed on a separate line. The left column of
the sequence viewer lists the entry name for the sequence, with the chain name
appended. The right column displays the actual sequence as a list of
single-letter codes, and also displays the secondary structure assignment, if
one is available. If the protein contains ligands, waters, or ions, these are
displayed in separate &quot;sequences&quot;, one for each type of molecule.
(These molecules are identified by the corresponding ASL expressions.)</p>

<p>To show or hide the sequence viewer, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Edit &rarr; Toolbars &rarr; Sequence Viewer</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>

</ul>
<p>The background colors of the sequences reflect the current coloring scheme for
the alpha carbon in the Workspace. Each residue in the sequence also has a
tooltip that gives the residue name, number, and insertion code.</p>

<p>If the protein has a secondary structure assignment, the assignment is displayed
above the sequence, using the following symbols:</p>

<ul>
<li>Helices are displayed as tubes, colored red</li>
<li>Strands are displayed as arrows, colored cyan</li>
<li>Loops are displayed as a gray line</li>
</ul>

<p>You can select residues in the sequence and perform actions on these
residues.</p>
<ul>
<li>To select a single residue, click the residue.</li> 
<li>To add single residues to the selection or remove single residues from the
selection, control-click the residues.</li>
<li>To select a range of residues, either click the first and shift-click
the last, or drag over the residues. If the sequence viewer is wrapped, you can
drag over multiple rows to select residues in more than one row; the residues
that are selected are those in the sequence in which you started dragging.</li> 
<li>To change the selection of a range of residues to the selection, hold down
<span class="Keys">CTRL</span> and drag over the residues.The unselected
residues are selected, and the selected residues are deselected.</li>

</ul>
<p>The selected residues are highlighted in reverse video (as colored letters on
a black background), and are marked in yellow in the Workspace. You can also
select the missing residue locations in gaps. </p>

<p>You can zoom in on a single residue by middle-clicking on it. This
action does not select the residue, but spot-centers on the alpha carbon and
fits the residue to the screen. If you middle-click on a gap, the structure is
not spot-centered but the view is zoomed in to the residues on either side of
the gap.</p>

<p>The sequence viewer and the Workspace are synchronized: selection of atoms in
the Workspace selects the corresponding residues in the sequence viewer, and
selection of residues in the sequence viewer selects them in the
Workspace. Likewise, changing the color scheme in the Workspace changes the
color scheme in the sequence viewer, and vice versa. Structural changes, such as
mutating a residue, are also reflected in the sequence viewer.</p>

<p>To zoom in on a residue in the Workspace without selecting it, middle-click
the residue in the sequence viewer.
</p>

<p>The sequence viewer has a shortcut menu (right-click and hold), which you can
use to perform various actions on the sequences or the display.
The sequence viewer shortcut menu is displayed when you right-click
in the left pane of the sequence viewer, or when you right-click in the right
pane of the sequence viewer when there are no residues selected. The menu items
are described in the <a href="shortcut_menus.html#seqviewer">Main Workspace
Shortcut Menus</a> topic.</p>

<p>If you have residues selected, a version of the Workspace shortcut menu is
displayed, with the following changes:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Switch Alternate Positions</span>, <span
class="GUI">Display Alternate Positions</span>, <span class="GUI">Clip</span>,
<span class="GUI">Center Electron Density</span>, and <span
class="GUI">Transform</span> are not present.
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Set Element</span> is replaced by <span
class="GUI">Insert Gap</span>, which opens a dialog box that 
allows you to specify the number of residues in the gap. The gap is inserted to
the left of the selected residue. To delete residues from a gap, select the
residues and choose <span class="GUI">Delete</span> from the shortcut menu. 
</p></li>
<li><p>There is one extra item on the <span class="GUI">Color
Scheme</span> submenu: <span class="GUI">Proximity</span>. If you
choose this item, the residues within a given distance of the selected residues 
are colored orange, and the selected residues are colored red. All others are
colored gray. The distance is specified in the <span class="GUI">Sequence 
Viewer - Preferences</span> dialog box, which you open from the sequence viewer
shortcut menu.
</p></li>
</ul>
