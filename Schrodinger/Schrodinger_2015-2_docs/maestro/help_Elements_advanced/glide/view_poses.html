<p>Maestro has a special facility for viewing poses from a pose viewer file 
(<code>_pv.maegz</code>) or an ensemble pose viewer file
(<code>_epv.maegz</code>). This facility allows you to step through poses with
the receptor fixed in the Workspace. You can also define and display hydrogen
bonds, contacts, and per-residue interactions, and count hydrogen bonds and
contacts. If you have flexible hydroxyl or thiol groups (&quot;rotatable
groups&quot;) in the receptor, these are shown in the correct orientation for
each pose, and you can export the receptor and poses for given orientations of
the rotatable groups. If you have multiple receptors from an ensemble pose
viewer file, the best receptor for each ligand is shown as you step through the
ligands.</p> 
<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Pose Viewer</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Entry &rarr; View Poses</span> in the <span class="GUI">Project Table</span> panel.
</p></li>
<li><p>Right-click on an entry group in the <span class="GUI">Project
Table</span> panel or the <span class="GUI">Entry List</span> panel and choose
<span class="GUI">View Poses</span>. 
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This panel is dockable, so it opens by default in the Workspace. You can
change this behavior in the <a href="../maestro_menu/preferences.html"><span
class="GUI">Preferences</span> panel</a>, under <span class="GUI">General
&ndash; Panels</span>.
</p>

<p><span class="HB">To start using the pose viewing facility:</span></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Select a single entry group in the Project Table.</p>
<p>The receptor or receptors must be at the beginning of the group, followed
by the ligands. This is the normal situation when you import a pose viewer file
into the project.</p></li>

<li><p>Open the <span class="GUI">Pose Viewer</span> panel (see above).
</p></li>
<li><p>Click <span class="GUI">Set Up</span>
</p>
<p>The receptor is fixed in the Workspace, the first ligand entry is
included in the Workspace, and the view zooms to the ligand.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If the results are not already imported into the project,
do one of the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Open the <span class="GUI">Pose Viewer</span> panel (see above), click
<span class="GUI">Import File</span>, and navigate to and import the pose-viewer
file. Setup is performed automatically.
</p></li>
<li><p>Click the <span class="GUI">Import</span> toolbar button, ensure that
<span class="GUI">For pose-viewer files, turn on pose viewing</span> is
selected, then navigate to and import the pose-viewer file. When the file
is imported into the project, the <span class="GUI">Pose Viewer</span> panel
opens and setup is performed automatically.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>You can now perform the following actions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Step through the poses using the right arrow and left arrow keys.
</p></li>
<li><p>Use the ePlayer to step through the poses, play through the poses
automatically, and perform actions on the poses with a script.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="../eplayer/eplayer.html">The ePlayer</a>.
</p></li> 
<li><p>Display non-bonded interactions: hydrogen bonds, halogen bonds, contacts,
and pi interactions.</p>
<p>To do so, select the appropriate<span class="GUI">Display</span> options in
the <span class="GUI">Non-bonded interactions</span> section of the panel. The
display is turned on for each ligand in the entry group. </p>
<p>You can also set the parameters that define the interactions, by clicking 
<span class="GUI">Define</span> in the <span class="GUI">Non-bonded
interactions</span> section.
This button opens the 
<a href="../tools_menu/nonbonded_interactions.html"><span class="GUI">Non-Bonded
Interactions</span> panel</a>. In this panel you can change the color of the
markers and choose the atom sets between which markers are displayed. The panel
also provides access to the <span class="GUI">Non-bonded interactions &ndash;
Criteria</span> section of the <span class="GUI">Preferences</span> panel, where
the parameters that define each interaction can be changed.
</p></li>
<li><p>Calculate counts of hydrogen and halogen bonds, contacts, and pi
interactions.</p>
<p>To do this, click <span class="GUI">Create Property</span> in the <span
class="GUI">Non-bonded Interactions</span> section. A dialog box opens, in which
you can choose which of the three types of interactions to create properties
for. The counts may take a little time to evaluate. They are added as project
properties to the entries selected for pose viewing.
</p></li>
<li><p>Visualize per-residue interactions.</p>
<p>The visualization  is turned on by selecting <span class="GUI">Display</span>
in the <span class="GUI">Per-Residue Interactions</span> section. The
per-residue interactions are represented by coloring the residues by the value
of the interaction, using a color ramp. To select the residues that are colored
and which interactions are visualized, click <span class="GUI">Define</span> in
the <span class="GUI">Per-Residue Interactions</span> section, and make settings
in the <a href="../pt_entry_menu/per_residue_interactions_panel.html"><span
class="GUI">Per-Residue Interactions</span> panel</a>.</p>
<p>Per-residue interactions cannot be set up from the Elements profile. You
can do this with the <span class="GUI">Ligand Docking</span> panel in the
Maestro profile, for example.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Export the receptor and poses with particular orientations of rotatable
groups in the receptor.
</p>
<p>If you have defined a set of rotatable groups (hydroxyls in Ser, Thr, and Tyr
residues, or thiols in Cys residues) in the receptor, you can export the
receptor with different orientations of these groups. The coordinates of the
receptor in the pose viewer file are for the original orientation, but the
receptor includes information on the alternative orientations. This option
allows you to write a file with the alternative coordinates.</p>
<p>To do so, you should first include one of the poses that has this orientation
in the Workspace. Next, click <span class="GUI">Export Rotatable Groups</span>.
In the <a href="../project_facility/export_rotatable_groups_db.html"><span
class="GUI">Export Rotatable Groups</span> dialog box</a> you can choose whether
to export just the receptor, the receptor and the included pose, or the receptor
and all poses for which the receptor has that particular orientation of the
flexible groups.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="HB">To finish viewing poses:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Select any single entry.</p>
<p>Pose viewing finishes because a single entry group is no longer selected.
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Entry &rarr; Exclude</span>, or type <span
class="Keys">Ctrl+X</span> (<span class="Keys">&#x2318;X</span>). </p>
<p>The receptor is no longer fixed in the Workspace.
</p></li>
</ol>
