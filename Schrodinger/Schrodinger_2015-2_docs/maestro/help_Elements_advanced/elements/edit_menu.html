<p>The <span class="GUI">Edit</span> menu provides access to tools for editing
and adjusting the structures in the Workspace. The default menu items are
as follows.
</p>

<ul>

<li><p><a href="../edit_menu/undo_action.html"><span class="GUI">Undo</span></a>&mdash;Undo
the last undoable action. The menu item changes to display the name of the last
command executed. When you undo an action, the menu item changes to
Redo. Undoing can also be performed with the <span class="GUI">Undo</span>
button on the <span class="GUI">Edit</span> toolbar:
</p>
<p><img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/undo.png" /></p>
</li>

<li><p><span class="GUI">Copy</span>&mdash;Copy the Workspace selection onto the
clipboard, and copy an image of the Workspace. The clipboard stores the
atoms in the selection in Maestro format and SMILES format, and an an image of
the Workspace. The SMILES string and the image can be pasted into another
application; the atoms can be pasted back into the Workspace. The resolution of
the image is the current screen resolution, so if you want a higher resolution,
you should use the <a href="../workspace_menu/saveimage_panel.html"><span 
class="GUI">Save Image</span> panel</a>. Keyboard shortcut: <span
class="GUI">Ctrl+C</span> (<span class="Keys">&#x2318;C</span>).
</p></li>

<li><p><span class="GUI">Paste</span>&mdash;Paste a structure from the clipboard
into the Workspace. The structure can be a SMILES string, a structure from
ChemDraw or Isis Draw (Windows) or a set of atoms previously cut or copied 
from the Workspace. Keyboard shortcut: <span class="GUI">Ctrl+V</span> (<span class="Keys">&#x2318;V</span>).</p>
<p>If the structure is a SMILES string, it is converted into a 2D structure. The
2d structure is added to the project as a new entry, with the SMILES string for
the structure as the title. No attempt is made at 3D conversion. You should
consider running <a href="../ligprep/ligprep.html">LigPrep</a> to convert the
structure to 3D. </p>
<p>If you paste a set of atoms that were cut or copied from Maestro, they are
placed at the coordinates at which they were cut or copied onto the clipboard.
You can paste atoms from one Maestro session into another session.
</p>
</li>

<li><p><span class="GUI">Paste Special</span>&mdash;Paste a structure into the
Workspace, with some extra processing. The items on this submenu are:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="GUI">Selected text</span>&mdash;Paste a structure into the
Workspace that is in the Linux paste buffer (selected text). To enable this
option, you must run the Maestro command <code>workspacepastesettings
enableselect=on</code> in the <span class="GUI">Commands</span> text box, or add
it to your <code>maestro.cmd</code> file to turn it on when Maestro starts.
</li>
<li><span class="GUI">By Placing</span>&mdash;Place the structure centroid by
picking a location in the Workspace. This is useful when there are other
structures that you want to position the structure near, or when the coordinate
origin is off-screen. When you select this option, the pointer changes to an
arrow, to indicate that you are picking a location in the Workspace to past the
structure, rather than an atom. Keyboard shortcut: <span
class="Keys">Ctrl+Shift+V</span> (<span class="Keys">&#x21E7;&#x2318;V</span>).
</li>
<li><span class="GUI">As 3D</span>&mdash;Convert a 1D or 2D structure to 3D,
using any stereochemical information, and paste it into the Workspace with its
centroid at the coordinate origin. The structure is added to the project as a
new entry, with the SMILES string for the structure as the title. </li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><p><span class="GUI">Delete</span>&mdash;Delete objects from the Workspace.
This submenu has several sections. The first two sections have a single item,
for picking objects to delete and for deleting the selected atoms. The next
section lists other kinds of structural objects that can be deleted: hydrogens,
waters, and zero-order bonds. The item in the next section opens the <a
href="../misc/asd.html"><span class="GUI">Atom Selection</span> dialog box</a>
for defining which atoms to delete. The last section allows you to delete 
various kinds of markers associated with the structures in the Workspace: 
labels, measurements, H-bonds, contacts, ribbons, adjustments, and captions. 
</p></li>

<li><p><span class="GUI">Pick</span>&mdash;Choose the structural unit to use
when picking in the Workspace. This submenu allows you to select a structural
unit, from <span class="GUI">Atoms</span>, <span class="GUI">Residues</span>,
<span class="GUI">Chains</span>, <span class="GUI">Molecules</span>, or <span
class="GUI">Entries</span>. You can then pick these units in the Workspace to
make an atom selection. You can do the same tasks with the <span
class="GUI">Select</span> button on the <span class="GUI">Edit</span> toolbar.
</p>
<p><img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/ws_A.png" /></p>
</li>

<li><p><span class="GUI">Find</span>&mdash;Display the <a
href="../workspace/find_toolbar.html"><span class="GUI">Find</span> toolbar</a>
so that you can find structural objects in the Workspace.
</p></li>


<li><p><span class="GUI">Sculpting Mode</span>&mdash;Select this option to
drag atoms in the Workspace to a new location and minimize the energy of the
surrounding atoms. See <a href="../tools_menu/structure_sculpting.html">Structure
Sculpting</a>for more information</p></li>

<li><p><span class="GUI">Pick to Transform</span>&mdash;Select this option to
pick atoms to rotate and translate (&quot;local transformation&quot;). This
allows you to modify the structure. You can temporarily exit this mode if you
want to rotate or translate the workspace view by holding down the <span
class="Keys">Spacebar</span>.
</p></li>

<li><p><span class="GUI">Build</span>&mdash;Build 
or modify structures in the Workspace, using the
<span class="GUI">Build</span> and <span class="GUI">Fragments</span> toolbars
and the <a href="../edit_menu/builder_panel.html"><span class="GUI">Build</span>
panel</a>. This submenu has the following items:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Build Toolbar</span>&mdash;Display the
<a href="../tool_bar/main_build_toolbar.html"><span class="GUI">Build</span>
toolbar</a></p></li> 
<li><p><span class="GUI">Fragments Toolbar</span>&mdash;Display the
<a href="../tool_bar/main_fragments_toolbar.html"><span class="GUI">Fragments</span>
toolbar</a></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Fragments</span>&mdash;Add molecular fragments to a
structure, or place them in the Workspace. Opens the <span class="GUI">Build
Panel</span> at the <a href="../edit_menu/builder_panel.html#fragments"><span
class="GUI">Fragments</span> tab</a>.
</p></li>

<li><p><span class="GUI">Atom Properties</span>&mdash;Modify atom properties,
such as element, atom type, partial charge. Opens the <span class="GUI">Build
Panel</span> at the <a href="../edit_menu/builder_panel.html#atom_properties"><span
class="GUI">Atom Properties</span> tab</a>.
</p></li>

<li><p><span class="GUI">Residue Properties</span>&mdash;Modify residue
properties, such as residue type and residue number. Opens the 
<span class="GUI">Build Panel</span> at the 
<a href="../edit_menu/builder_panel.html#residue_properties"><span class="GUI">Residue
Properties</span> tab</a>.  
</p></li>

<li><p><a href="../edit_menu/geometry_cleanup.html"><span class="GUI">Clean Up
Geometry</span></a>&mdash;Clean up the geometry of the Workspace structure by
minimizing its energy. By default the OPLS_2005 force field is used. If this
does not include the atoms you need to minimize, you can set a <a
href="../maestro_menu/preferences.html#builder_cleanup">preference</a> to use 
the UFF force field, which covers a wider range of atoms but is slower.<br/>
Keyboard shortcut: <span class="Keys">U</span>.
</p></li>
</ul>

adjustment by picking, step through adjustments, adjust various defined
quantities, open the <a href="../edit_menu/adjust_panel.html"><span

open the <a href="../edit_menu/htreat_panel.html"><span class="GUI">Add
Hydrogens - Advanced</span> panel</a> in which you can choose a force-field
treatment and apply it to selected hydrogen atoms.
