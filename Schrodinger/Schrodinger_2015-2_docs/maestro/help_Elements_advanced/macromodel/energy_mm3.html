<p>The MM3* force field is a modification of MM3. The modifications
include: partial charge electrostatics, explicit parametrization
of conjugated systems, and minimal additional parameters.
Hydrogen bonding has not yet been implemented.</p>
<p>
The MM3* is an excellent force field for simple, monofunctional
organic molecules, but it has poor accuracy with molecules having
multiple polar functional groups. Solvation energies are accurate
only with nonpolar solvents (e.g. chloroform)</p>
<p>
MM3* is an all-atom model that uses no lone electron pairs.
Constant dielectric electrostatics (e = 1) are assigned by default.</p>
<p>
The MM3* is based on N.L. Allinger's MM3 Force Field
(J .Am. Chem. Soc. 1989, 111, 8552). The current parameter
set is from Allinger's 1991 version. The MacroModel (the computational component
of MacroModel) implementation of MM3 differs from authentic MM3 as follows:</p>
<p>
1. Electrostatics - whereas the authentic MM3 program
uses dipole/dipole electrostatic interactions, we use
partial atomic charges that are derived from the MM3
dipoles.  The field is also set for a distance-dependent
dielectric to mimic polarization effects but this can
be changed to a constant dielectric treatment using the
ELECT button.</p>
<p>
2. Conjugated Systems - Whereas MM3 uses a pi-electron
calculation of bond orders, MacroModel uses specific
torsional force constants to reproduce known rotational
energies of conjugated systems (1,3-dienes, enones, etc).</p>
<p>
3. Out-of-plane Bending - To maintain the planarity of
sp2 atoms, MM3 uses an out-of-plane bending equation
that MacroModel approximates by an improper torsion.
The differences are insignificant except for significantly
distorted sp2 systems.</p>
<p>
4. Finally, MacroModel uses a special set of nonbonded
parameters for hydrogen bonding atoms which are compatible
with partial charge electrostatics.</p>
<p>
The MacroModel treatment of MM3 is fully equivalent to the
authentic field with the exception of the above and additional
or justifiably modified parameters.  Such new
parameters are listed in .mmo output files as 'A' or 'M'
parameters.  FOR AUTHENTIC MM3 CALCULATIONS, USE THE MM3
PROGRAM WHICH IS AVAILABLE FROM PROFESSOR ALLINGER.</p>
<p>
Any missing parameters will be listed in the MacroModel
job .log file calculations.  Parameters for MacroModel MM3
calculations are taken from the file 'mm3.fld'. </p>
