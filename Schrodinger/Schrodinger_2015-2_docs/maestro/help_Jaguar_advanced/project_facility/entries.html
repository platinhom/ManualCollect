<p>An entry is a collection of atoms.  That is, an entry consists of one or more
molecules (structures) grouped together and assigned an entry ID and a title.
Bonds may NOT span entries.</p> 

<p> There is one entry per row in the <span class="GUI">Project Table</span>.
The entry ID and the title are included as columns in the table.
The title can be changed, but the entry ID cannot be changed.</p> 

<p>A scratch entry consists of atoms in the Workspace that
are NOT part of any entry in the <span class="GUI">Project Table</span>.
For example, if you begin drawing structures in an empty Workspace
these structures are considered part of the scratch entry.</p>

<p>Entries can be modified by including them in the Workspace and then making
changes. Maestro maintains an association between the included entries in the
project and their respective Workspace atoms, in order to track changes made in
the Workspace. By default, changes made to the entries in the Workspace are
saved back to the project.  You can choose not to have changes saved back into
the project automatically: saving of Workspace changes is controlled by a <a 
href="../maestro_menu/preferences.html#project_entry">preference</a>. You can
also protect entries against changes by &quot;locking&quot; them.
