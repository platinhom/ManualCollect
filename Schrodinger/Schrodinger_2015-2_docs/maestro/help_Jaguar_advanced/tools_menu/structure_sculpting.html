<p>Protein scuplting is a special mode in which the movement of atoms is
followed by a short force-field minimization that includes nearby atoms. Once
you enter this mode, you can select atoms and drag them to a new location (with
the left mouse button). When you release the mouse button, the minimization
starts. The selected atoms are restrained. Atoms in the same residues have no
constraints placed on them; atoms in complete residues that are within
5&nbsp;&Aring; of these residues are restrained, and all other atoms are
frozen. The minimization proceeds for a fixed number of cycles (500) or until
there is no significant change in any atom positions (0.005&nbsp;&Aring;).
During the minimization you can continue to work on the structure. The
minimization stops if you exit the mode, for example by choosing some other
action that involves picking atoms, or change the content of the Workspace. If
you select some more atoms and drag them while the minimization is proceeding,
it stops and a new minimization begins. The minimization also stops when you
select any other operation that performs atom picking, or if you click in an
empty region of the Workspace
