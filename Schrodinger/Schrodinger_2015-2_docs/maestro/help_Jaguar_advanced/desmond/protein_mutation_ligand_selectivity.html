<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Evaluate the change in binding free energy on mutation of a protein residue
in the presence of a ligand to determine whether the residue is important for
ligand selectivity.</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the FEP Protein Mutation for Ligand Selectivity Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">FEP Protein Mutation for Ligand Selectivity</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Applications &rarr; Desmond &rarr; FEP Protein Mutation for Ligand Selectivity</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
</ul>


<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the FEP Protein Mutation for Ligand Selectivity Panel</h2> 


<p>The purpose of this panel is to provide information on how the mutation of a
protein residue affects the binding of a ligand. It can be used to probe drug
resistance and explore the role of various protein residues in ligand
binding. As such, it is a complement to the FEP Mapper tool, which can be used
to explores the variation of ligand structure on binding.
</p>
<p>The input is a protein structure and one or more ligand structures, though
only a single ligand can be used currently. The output structures for each
mutation are written to a Maestro file. 
</p>
<p>To choose the residue to mutate, you can pick it in the Workspace, pick it in
the ligand interaction diagram, or select it in the residues table. When you
have chosen a residue, click in the <span class="GUI">Mutation</span> column to
set the mutations. You can only mutate a single residue in a given run, but you
can do multiple mutations on this residue in that run.

buttons.
</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="GUI">Project Table</span>&mdash;Use the entries that are
currently selected in the Project Table. The ligands must be selected in the
Project Table. The protein must either be the first selected entry in the
Project Table, or be included in the Workspace (and not selected).  The ligands
must be in separate entries: if the protein has a ligand in the active site, it
is ignored.
</li>
<li><span class="GUI">File</span>&mdash;Use the structures from the specified
file. Clicking the button opens a file selector, so you can navigate to the file
you want to open. The file must be a Maestro file, and contain the protein in
the first entry and the ligands in the rest (&quot;pose viewer&quot; format).
The structures in the file are imported into the Maestro project. 
</li>

<dd><p>Lists available ligand structures and indicates whether calculations can
be run with these ligands, in the <span class="GUI">Health</span> column. You
can select a single ligand from the table, which will be used for the
calculations. When you select a ligand, it is shown in the ligand interaction
diagram. The tool tip in the <span class="GUI">Health</span> column gives
information about problems with the ligand that would prevent a calculation from
being run. The main problems to be addressed are listed below:

<p>The last two issues can be fixed by running LigPrep on the ligand (which is
recommended).

that residue.

<dd><p>Show residues in the table that may not be mutated. The table rows are
dimmed, and cannot be selected for mutation. The residues that may not be
mutated are charged residues and proline. By default, prohibited residues are
not shown in the table. Note that mutation to self is also prohibited. 
</p></dd>

<a name="feature3.4"></a>
<dt>Residues table</dt>
<dd><p>This table lists the residues in the protein, filtered by the choice from
the <span class="GUI">Show</span> option menu. You can click in
the <span class="GUI">Mutation</span> column to choose the mutations for a
residue. A small panel opens above the row, in which you can select multiple
mutations, either by individual residue or by residue type. The check boxes for
prohibited residues (charged, proline) are dimmed, to indicate that they may not
be selected as valid mutations. The panel closes when you click elsewhere in the
main panel, press <span class="Keys">ESC</span> 
or <span class="Keys">Enter</span>, or move the pointer out of the main panel.</p>
<p>You can only run a job that mutates a single residue. If you set mutations
for a second residue, the mutations for the first residue are cleared.

a menu, from which you can make settings or perform actions that are related to
the job. </p>
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/settings.png" />
<p>The menu items are described below.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="GUI">Job Settings</span>&mdash;Make and save settings for the
incorporation of the job into the Maestro project, the job name, the host,
the distribution of subjobs, and any other application-specific job settings.

<dt><span class="GUI">Job status</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>This icon indicates when there are jobs running for the application that
belong to the current project. It starts spinning when the first job starts, and
stops when there are no more jobs running. If a job fails to start, it changes
to an exclamation point. 
</p>
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/job_status.png" />
<p>
Clicking the button shows a small job status window that lists the job name and
status for all active jobs submitted from the current panel (for Jaguar and
MacroModel this means all jobs from any of the application panels). You can
double-click on a row to open the <a href="../misc/monitor_panel.html"><span
class="GUI">Monitor</span> panel</a> and monitor the job, or click the <span
class="GUI">Monitor</span> button to open the <span class="GUI">Monitor</span>
panel and close the job status window. The job status is updated while the
window is open. If a job finishes while the window is open, the job remains
displayed but with the new status.  The rows are colored according to the
status: yellow for submitted, green for launched, running, or finished, red for
incorporated, died, or killed.  Click anywhere outside the window to close it.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Run</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Run the job with the current job settings.

<dd><p>The status bar displays information about the current job settings for the
panel. This includes the job name, task name and task settings (if any), number
of subjobs (if any) and the host name and job incorporation setting. It also
displays a message for a short time when you start a new job.</p>
<p>The status bar also contains the <span class="GUI">Help</span> button, which
