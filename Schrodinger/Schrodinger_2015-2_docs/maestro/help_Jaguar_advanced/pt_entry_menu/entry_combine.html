<p>To create a new entry by merging existing entries, select the entries to be
merged and choose <span class="GUI">Entry &rarr; Merge</span>.  The merged entry
is added to the Project Table after the last selected entry (and inside the
entry group of the last selected entry, if it exists). The previously selected
entries, whose content was used to create the new entry, remain in the project.
The selected entries are added to the new entry in the order in which they
appear in the Project Table. You can therefore control the order of addition by
moving the entries in the Project Table before merging them.
</p>
<p>Properties are also copied to the new entry. The properties of the entry with
the most atoms (the &quot;lead&quot; entry) are copied first, then the
properties of other entries are added, in Project Table order, to any blank
cells. The title of the new entry is a concatenation of the titles of the source
entries, lead entry first, then the others in Project Table order. If more than
three entries are merged, the lead title is used with a suffix <span
class="GUI">_merged</span><i>N</i>, where <i>N</i> is the number of merged
entries. The entry name is likewise merged. Auxiliary data is not copied.
</p>
<p>There is no panel or dialog box associated with this command. </p>
<p>An alternative way of creating a new entry from several existing entries is
to include them in the Workspace, then create an entry from the Workspace. The
order in which the entries appear in the new entry is the order in which they
were included in the Workspace.
</p>
<p>If you want to merge entries in the order of their entry IDs, use the Maestro
command <code>entrycombine order=entryid</code>.
