<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>The <span class="GUI">Add Hydrogens - Advanced</span> panel is used to delete
or add hydrogens to be consistent with the currently selected hydrogen
treatment. A &quot;hydrogen treatment&quot; in this context refers to a policy
that determines which atoms are to have hydrogens or lone pairs
attached. Several different treatments are supplied with Maestro.
Each of these treatments is associated with a particular molecular
mechanics force field. Note, however, that some treatments are
suitable for several force fields.</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Add Hydrogens - Advanced Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Add Hydrogens - Advanced</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Edit &rarr; Add Hydrogens &rarr; Advanced</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
</ul>


<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Add Hydrogens - Advanced Panel</h2> 


<p>To change the current hydrogen treatment, select the desired treatment from
the <span class="GUI">Treatment</span> option menu.  Descriptions of the
treatments, including which force fields are compatible, appear in the <span
class="GUI">Description</span> text box when the treatments are selected. To
apply the treatment, use the standard <a
href="../misc/picking_controls.html">picking tools</a>. </p> 

<p>You can also apply the current hydrogen treatment using the <span
class="GUI">Add H</span> button on the <a
href="../tool_bar/main_edit_toolbar.html"><span class="GUI">Edit</span> toolbar</a>
in the main window. </p> 
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/addhydrogens.png" />
<p>This button has a menu from which you can select a structural unit to pick for
hydrogen treatment, or open the <span class="GUI">Atom Selection</span> dialog
box to select the atoms for hydrogen treatment.</p>

The standard <a href="../misc/picking_controls.html">picking tools</a>
are used to select atoms that will have hydrogens or lone pairs added or
deleted.</p>
<p>NOTE: HYDROGEN ADDITION OR DELETION ONLY TAKES PLACE TO BE CONSISTENT WITH
THE CURRENT TREATMENT. For example, if the currently selected treatment
calls for all atoms to have hydrogens and the current structure already
has hydrogens on all atoms, then no action is taken.</p>

<p>Also note that the current hydrogen treatment changes automatically as
the force field is changed using the controls in the <span
class="GUI">Potential</span> tab within any MacroModel panel. The treatment
selected is one of those which is known to be acceptable for the newly selected
force field.</p></dd>
