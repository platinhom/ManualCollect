<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
The <span class="GUI">Connect and Fuse Panel</span> can be used to perform
rigid-body connection or fusion of atom pairs.
</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Connect and Fuse Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Connect and Fuse</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Edit &rarr; Connect and Fuse</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
</ul>


<p>This panel is dockable, so it opens by default in the Workspace. You can
change this behavior in the <a href="../maestro_menu/preferences.html"><span
class="GUI">Preferences</span> panel</a>, under <span class="GUI">General
&ndash; Panels</span>.
</p>

<h2>Using the Connect and Fuse Panel</h2> 


<p>
To connect or fuse two molecules, you must first define the pairs of atoms that
will be connected or fused. When you pick atom pairs, the first atom of each
pair must always come from the same molecule. Likewise, the second atom of the
pair must also come from the same molecule, but this molecule must be different
from the molecule that the first atom of a pair comes from. </p>

<p>If <span class="GUI">Show markers</span> is selected, then the selected atom
pairs are connected with green dashed lines. As each pair is selected it is added
to the list at the top of the panel.
</p>

<p>Once you have selected all the atom pairs to be connected or fused, click
<span class="GUI">Connect</span> or <span class="GUI">Fuse</span>.  After the
operation, the markers are deleted and the list is cleared. Hydrogen atoms are
deleted to maintain correct valence, but other atoms are not. If a valence
violation would result from the operation, a warning is given and the operation
is canceled. </p>

<p>If you connect or fuse molecules that belong to different entries, a
<span class="GUI">Choose Entries</span> dialog box is displayed when you click
<span class="GUI">Connect</span> or <span class="GUI">Fuse</span>.
You must choose one of the two entries. The chosen entry now contains the new
molecule, and the other entry is deleted. This operation, including the entry
deletion, can be undone. </p>

<dt><span class="GUI">Connect or fuse atoms</span> list</dt>
<dd><p>This list contains the pairs of atoms that have been picked for connection
or fusion. The first atom in every pair must belong to one of the two molecules
and the second to the other molecule.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Delete</span> and <span class="GUI">Delete All</span>
buttons</dt> 
<dd><p>These buttons can be used to delete individual atom pairs from the list
or to delete all atoms from the list. To delete an atom pair, select the pair
in the list and click <span class="GUI">Delete</span>. If markers are
displayed, the marker is deleted as well.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Pick to define atom pairs</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>When selected, this option allows you to pick atom pairs to be connected
or fused. The option is selected when you first open the panel.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature4"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Show markers</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>When selected, the atom pairs are connected with green dashed lines.
The currently selected atom pair is marked wit two solid lines on either side
of the dashed line.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Connect</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>When you click this button, the atom pairs are connected with a single
bond, and hydrogen atoms are deleted if necessary to maintain the correct
valence.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature6"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Fuse</span></dt>
<dd><p>When you click this button, the second atom in each pair is replaced by
the first atom in each pair, and attached hydrogen atoms are deleted to maintain
the correct valence.
