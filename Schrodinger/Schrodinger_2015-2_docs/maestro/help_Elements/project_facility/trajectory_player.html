<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>In this panel you can play through trajectories from Desmond simulations,
examine individual frames, and export trajectory data in a variety of forms.
</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Trajectory Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Trajectory</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Click the
<span class="GUI">T</span> button in the <span class="GUI">Title</span> column of
the Project Table for the entry whose trajectory you want to view.
</p></li></ul>


<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Trajectory Panel</h2> 


<p>The speed at which a trajectory is played depends on the number of operations
that are performed on each frame. For faster play, options like <span
class="GUI">Update secondary structure</span> and <span class="GUI">Also display
residues within</span> should not be selected, as they involve a fair amount of
time to evaluate. However, if you are creating a movie, the speed of play in the
Workspace does not matter, and including these options is not an issue.
</p>

<p>You can have other entries in the Workspace while playing through a
trajectory. This can be useful for viewing the trajectory against some static
objects. It also allows you to set up measurement markers between the trajectory
and the other entries, which are preserved during play. When the trajectory is
loaded, you are prompted to choose whether to keep these objects in the
Workspace or remove them. 
</p>

<p>Setting up superposition on an external structure must be done with care. The
superposition is done with an ASL expression, and if the order of the atoms in
the trajectory frames is not the same as in the external structure, you may get
unexpected results. It is best to use ASL expressions that do not translate to
atom numbers, like <code>mol.entry 1</code>, for the first molecule in the
entry, or <span class="GUI">protein</span>. The atom selection button contains a
list of choices of this kind, like <span class="GUI">Protein</span> or <span
class="GUI">Ligands</span>. If the atom ordering is a problem, you could align
the external structure to a particular frame, and then play the trajectory by
superimposing on that frame.

<h3>Frame control section</h3>
<p>This section has controls for the display of individual frames and for
playing through the frames.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><span class="GUI">Start</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>Starting frame number. Play starts from this frame when played forward
from the beginning. Frames are numbered from 0.
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">End</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>Ending frame number.  Play ends at this frame when played forward.
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Frame</span> slider and frame text box</dt>
<dd><p>Selects the frame to view. The frame number is displayed in the text box
below the slider, which you can also use to select a frame. The total number of
frames is also displayed in a noneditable text box.
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Step</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>Set the number of frames to step when playing through frames. This value
does not affect the <span class="GUI">Frame</span> slider. The frames that
are selected for play can be exported as a selection of frames, using the output
buttons.
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Time</span> text boxes</dt>
<dd><p>Displays the time for the current frame and the total time for the
trajectory. You can enter a time in the text box to select a frame. 
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Speed</span> slider</dt>
<dd><p>Set the speed at which the frames are played. 
</p></dd>
</dl>

<a name="feature6"></a>
<h3>Hide clipping planes during continuous play option</h3>
<p>This option hides the clipping planes window while the trajectory is being
played, and redisplays it when play stops. Hiding the clipping planes window
speeds up playing the trajectory by about 50%. 
</p>

<a name="feature3"></a>
<h3>Display section</h3>
<p>This section controls what is displayed when playing the trajectory. 
</p>

<dl>
<dt><span class="GUI">Use lower quality drawing to speed up play</span>
option</dt>
<dd><p>Selecting this option uses a lower quality representation of objects
(tubes, spheres) in the Workspace to speed up play. It has no effect on wire
frame representation.</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Update secondary structure</span></dt>
<dd><p>Update the secondary structure assignment for each frame during
play.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Show simulation box</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Show the edges of the simulation box (in purple) when this option is
selected. 
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Show axes</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Show the coordinate axes (in green) when this option is selected.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Replicate system</span> text boxes</dt>
<dd><p>Enter the number of replicas of the system to display in each of the
three directions. This enables you to visualize the movement across the
simulation box boundaries. 
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Trajectory smoothing</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>Smooth the trajectory by averaging the coordinates over the specified
number of frames. 
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Positioning</span> options</dt>
<dd><p>These options control the positioning of each frame during play.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="GUI">Do not adjust</span>&mdash;Do not adjust the positioning of each frame. </li>
<li><span class="GUI">Superimpose on frame <i>N</i></span>&mdash;Superimpose
selected atoms in each frame on the corresponding atoms in the frame number
given in the text box. Use the <span class="GUI">Pick atoms for 
frame positioning</span> picking controls to make the atom selection.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Superimpose on Workspace
structure</span>&mdash;Superimpose selected atoms in each frame on the
corresponding atoms in the Workspace structure. This allows you to view the
trajectory against some static objects in the Workspace.  Use the <span
class="GUI">Pick atoms for frame positioning</span> picking controls to make the
atom selection, which must match both the Workspace entries and the trajectory
structure. See <a href="#using">Using the Trajectory Panel</a> for information
on using this feature.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Center molecules</span>&mdash;Center the selected
molecules in the viewing area. Use the <span class="GUI">Pick atoms for 
frame positioning</span> picking controls to select the molecules.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Pick atoms for frame positioning</span> picking
controls</dt> 
<dd><p>Pick the atoms that are used to position each frame, using the standard 
<a href="../misc/picking_controls.html">picking controls</a> in this
box. You should consider picking atoms that do not change their position much
during the simulation. 
</p></dd>
</dl>

<a name="feature4"></a>
<h3>Atoms to display in each frame section</h3>

<p>This section controls which atoms are displayed in each frame. 
</p>

<dl>
<dt><span class="GUI">Always display these atoms</span> picking controls</dt>
<dd><p>Pick the atoms that should be always visible in each frame &mdash; for
example, the ligand in a ligand-receptor complex.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Also display residues within</span> option and text box</dt>
<dd><p>Display entire residues that have any atoms within the specified distance
of the atoms that are always displayed. This expression is evaluated dynamically
for each frame. As a consequence, a particular residue might not be displayed in
all frames &mdash; for example, a water molecule might move in and out of the
specified distance. 
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Display only specified atoms</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Turn on or off the display of the specified atoms. If this option is
selected, only those atoms that are specified with the tools in this section are
displayed. If this option is not selected, all atoms are displayed.
</p></dd>
</dl>


<a name="feature5"></a>
<h3>Output buttons</h3>
<p>These buttons allow you to export the trajectory data in various forms.
You can export individual frames, all frames, or the selection of frames defined
by using the <span class="GUI">Start</span>, <span class="GUI">End</span>, and
<span class="GUI">Step</span> text boxes. 
</p>

from the structures. Opens the <a href="export_structure_db.html"><span
class="GUI">Export Structure</span> dialog box</a>, in which you can specify
where the structures will go, which structures to export, and which atoms to
export. 
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Image</span></dt>
<dd><p>Create an image of the Workspace with the current frame displayed.
Opens the <a href="../workspace_menu/saveimage_panel.html">
<span class="GUI">Save Image</span> dialog box</a>. </p></dd>

format. Opens the <a href="export_movie.html"><span class="GUI">Export
Movie</span> dialog box</a>, in which you can select the format and the frames
to be exported. </p></dd>
