<a name="background"></a>
<h3>Background tab</h3>

<p>The background color can be set by clicking the color button and
choosing a color in the standard color selector that opens, or by clicking one
of the five preset color buttons. The color change takes effect immediately.
</p>
<p> Background color can also be set using text commands. An example
follows.</p>

<p>Command Syntax: <code>displayopt [bgcolor=</code><i>colorname</i><code> |
bgcindex=</code><i>colorindx</i><code>]</code> </p>

<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To color background red: <code>displayopt bgcolor=red</code></p> </li>
<li><p>To color background with the color at color index 5: <code>displayopt bgcindex=5</code></p></li>
</ul>

<a name="lighting"></a>
<h3>Lighting tab</h3>

<p>The lighting tab contains controls for the lighting effects on objects in the
Workspace.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><span class="GUI">Light direction</span> display</dt>
<dd><p>The light direction control allow you to pick the direction of the
selected light. To change the direction, click the desired location on the red
ball, or drag the yellow spot to the desired location.
</p></dd>
<dt>Light source list</dt>
<dd><p>Select the light source for which the direction and properties are to be
adjusted.
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Use light</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Select this option to use the selected light. Deselecting this option
disables the controls for the light.
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Ambient</span> slider and text box</dt>
<dd><p>Set the ambient value with the slider, or enter the value in the text
box. This is the relative intensity of the (ambient) nondirectional light.
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Diffuse</span> slider and text box</dt>
<dd><p>Set the diffuse value with the slider, or enter the value in the text
box. This is the relative intensity of diffuse reflection (reflection that has
the same intensity in all directions).
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Specular</span> slider and text box</dt>
<dd><p>Set the specular value with the slider, or enter the value in the text
box. This is the specular reflection intensity (&quot;shiny&quot; reflection of
the light source) 
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Restore Defaults</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Restore the settings to their default values.
</p></dd>
</dl>


<a name="materials"></a>
<h3>Materials tab</h3>

<p>The materials tab contains controls for the definition of the appearance of
the objects in the Workspace. Some preset material and lighting styles are
available on the <a href="../tool_bar/main_wsassistant_toolbar.html"><span
class="GUI">Style</span> toolbar</a>.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><span class="GUI">Object type</span> option menu</dt>
<dd><p>Select the object whose material appearance is to be customized.
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Presets</span> buttons</dt>
<dd><p>These four buttons, <span class="GUI">Metallic</span>, <span
class="GUI">Plastic</span>, <span class="GUI">Rubber</span>, <span
class="GUI">Wood</span>, set values of the properties that control the
appearance of the selected object.
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Custom</span> section</dt>
<dd><p>This section allows you to set the five properties of the material:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="GUI">Ambient</span>&mdash;intensity of ambient (nondirectional
incident) light</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Diffuse</span>&mdash;intensity of diffuse (nondirectional)
reflection of light</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Specular</span>&mdash;intensity of specular (directional)
reflection of light</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Emission</span>&mdash;light emission intensity of the object</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Shininess</span>&mdash;size and brightness of specular
highlight (larger value gives a smaller and brighter highlight)</li>
</ul>
<p>Each property has a slider and a text box. You can
use either of these controls to set the property value. </p>
<p>The Minimize performance cost option disables the <span
class="GUI">Ambient</span> and <span class="GUI">Diffuse</span>
controls, and uses these properties to track color. This option is only present
when the OpenGL level is 1.2.
</p>
<p>The <span class="GUI">Environment map</span> option menu provides a selection
of environments that are shown as reflections on the surfaces of the objects in
the Workspace. This menu is only present when the OpenGL level is 2.1.
</p>

</dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Restore Defaults</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Restore the settings to their default values.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<a name="3D"></a>
<h3>3D tab</h3>

<p>The <span class="GUI">3D</span> tab contains the
<a href="#stereo"><span class="GUI">Stereo</span></a> tab and the
<a href="#perspective"><span class="GUI">Perspective</span></a> tab. The common
controls, located below the tabs, are described first, then the tabs themselves.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>Common controls</dt>
<dd>
<dl>
<dt><span class="GUI">Alignment depth</span> slider and text box</dt>
<dd><p>This slider translates the region of molecule space bounded by the front
and back clipping planes. This appears to move objects within that region, in or
out (along the z-axis), relative to the screen. Smaller alignment depth values
place the displayed objects farther from the viewer (farther behind screen).
Larger values place objects closer to the viewer (farther in front of
screen).</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Adjust clipping to preserve depth cues</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>This option determines whether the front and back clipping planes should
be automatically adjusted to preserve the eye separation while displaying in
stereo and to preserve the perspective scale (corresponding to viewing distance)
when displaying in perspective. When this option is enabled, perceived depth is
maintained but some objects may be clipped, especially when zooming in (in which
case, you may also want to adjust the alignment depth).
If <span class="GUI">Adjust clipping to preserve depth cues</span> is
deselected, then the stereo and perspective settings are automatically adjusted
in order to preserve the front and back clipping planes. Then, objects are not
clipped more in front and back when zooming in, but are effectively flattened
(reducing their perceived depth). These automatic adjustments are not
permanent, but are done whenever the current 3D settings cannot be used to
display, in an acceptable manner, the entire region between the front and back
clipping planes.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Enhance Depth Cues</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Click this button to move the front and back clipping planes in to the fit
the parts of the structure currently displayed in the Workspace. This helps the
stereo and perspective depth cues work more effectively for the spatial region
of interest, reducing the need to clip objects or sacrifice depth cues in order
to accommodate the display of unoccupied regions of space.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<a name="stereo"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Stereo</span> tab</dt>
<dd><p>
The settings in the <span class="GUI">Stereo</span> tab allow
you to view the structures displayed in the Workspace in stereo and to switch
between the stereo viewing methods. Stereo display only applies to the
Workspace&mdash;none of the Maestro main panel tools or other panels are
displayed in stereo. You might want to use full-screen mode when you are viewing
structures in stereo, which you can turn on and off with 
<span class="Keys">Ctrl+=</span> (<span class="Keys">&#x2318;=</span>), or by choosing
<span class="GUI">Workspace &rarr; Full Screen</span> and using <span
class="Keys">ESC</span> to exit.
</p>
<p>
You can also adjust the alignment depth to shift objects that you want to see
more clearly in stereo toward the plane of the screen.</p>

<p>The stereo method and settings persist across Maestro sessions.
</p>

<dl>

<dt><span class="GUI">Display in stereo</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Turn on the use of stereo display. This can also be done in the main
window with <span class="Keys">Ctrl+S</span> (<span
class="Keys">&#x2318;S</span>) or by choosing <span class="GUI">View &rarr;
Stereo</span>.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Swap stereo images</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Select this option to swap the images for the right eye and the left eye. 
This is useful to resolve synchronization problems with hardware stereo. It
applies also to the software stereo methods, and has the effect of swapping
cross-eyed and wall-eyed stereo. 
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Method</span> option menu</dt>
<dd><p>Select a stereo viewing method from this option menu. 
There are five stereo viewing options, three of which are software
implementations and do not require special hardware, and the other two are
hardware stereo methods. The software methods can be used on any computer, and
displayed remotely. The hardware methods can usually only be used locally.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Wall-eyed</span>&mdash;
In the &quot;wall-eyed&quot; stereo viewing method, the eyes focus on both
displayed images at once, instead of focusing at a central point. One difficulty
that may arise when using this stereo viewing method is that it is
difficult, if not impossible, to achieve the stereo effect when the images
are more than the inter-ocular distance apart, or about 2.5 inches.
Structures more than 2.5 inches wide will therefore need to be resized and
repositioned using the <a href="#stereo3.2"><span class="GUI">Size
factor</span></a> and <a href="#stereo3.3"><span class="GUI">Separation
factor</span></a> sliders. The height of the molecule is not critical for stereo
viewing. Any height less than the window height is acceptable.</p>

<p>To use the <span class="GUI">Wall-Eyed</span> stereo viewing option, stare
past the screen as if focusing on an image far beyond it. This tactic tricks the
eyes into focusing in a plane beyond the screen. When performed correctly,
wall-eyed viewing produces three images, with the center one being a 3D
combination of the two outer ones. </p></li>

<a name="stereo3.1.2"></a>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Cross-Eyed</span>&mdash;This stereo method is difficult
and is not advised for stereo viewing novices, since inadvertently viewing the
cross-eyed image wall-eyed will result in the molecule being inverted along the
z-axis. This can produce inaccurate depth information, particularly when the
wire molecular representation is being used. </p></li>

<a name="stereo3.1.3"></a>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Hardware</span>&mdash;Technically, this is quad-buffered
hardware stereo. It requires a suitable monitor, with a refresh rate greater
than 100&nbsp;Hz, a graphics card that supports quad-buffered stereo, and 3D
glasses. A warning is displayed if the hardware does not support stereo and this
option is selected. This option is not available on Mac platforms, which do not
in general support hardware stereo.</p> 
<p>There are other specialized viewing devices that can be used with this
method.</p>
</li>

<a name="stereo3.1.4"></a>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Interlaced</span>&mdash;This hardware method requires a 
monitor that supports interlacing, and 3D glasses. Interlaced stereo works on
all supported platforms if the hardware is available. A warning is displayed if
the hardware does not support stereo and this option is selected.</p></li>

<li><p><span class="GUI">Anaglyph</span>&mdash;This stereo method uses color
filters to display the two images. To use it, you must have glasses with one red
and one cyan filter. The stereo image is perceived in full color, though the red
colors tend to be somewhat dull. 
</p></li>

</ul>
</dd>

<a name="stereo3.2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Size factor</span> slider</dt>
<dd><p>Use this slider to reduce the size of the displayed structure to
better facilitate cross-eyed or wall-eyed viewing.
</p></dd>

<a name="stereo3.3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Separation factor</span> slider</dt>
<dd><p>Use this slider to decrease the distance between the left and right
stereo images. This feature eases cross-eyed and wall-eyed viewing.
The <span class="GUI">Separation factor</span> slider becomes available once the
displayed structures have been resized with the <span class="GUI">Size
factor</span> slider (see above).
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Eye separation</span> slider</dt>

<dd><p>Use this slider to adjust the stereo viewing angle, which governs the
amount of depth perceived in stereo. The stereo viewing angle increases roughly
in proportion to eye separation, and increases with perspective scale (decreases
in nearly inverse proportion to viewing distance). The slider should generally
be positioned near the center of the range, to correspond to a
&quot;normal&quot; adult inter-ocular distance of 2.5 inches and viewing
distance of 24 inches. Use smaller values for smaller inter-ocular distance or
larger viewing distance, or to reduce the side-effects of larger stereo angles,
such as clipping and double images.  Use larger values for larger inter-ocular
distance or smaller viewing distance, or to increase the amount of perceived
depth.</p>
<p>Reducing this parameter can help stereo perception with interlaced stereo
on certain monitors.
</p></dd>

</dl>

</dd>

<a name="perspective"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Perspective</span> tab</dt>
<dd><p>The Perspective feature helps facilitate 3D viewing by scaling the
apparent size of objects according to their z-axis depth (making more
distant objects appear smaller, as in normal viewing). To use perspective,
select <span class="GUI">Display in perspective</span>. Perspective is enabled
by default. </p>
<p>The amount of perspective, which relates to the viewing distance, can be
adjusted using the <span class="GUI">Perspective scale</span> slider.
Here, perspective scale is the ratio between the actual size and the
projected size of an object placed 0.7 feet behind the display screen.
This has a corresponding viewing distance,<br /><br />
view_dist = (0.7 ft) / (perspective_scale - 1)<br /><br />
For a known viewing distance,<br /><br />
perspective_scale = 1 + (0.7 ft / view_dist)<br /><br />
Therefore, for a normal viewing distance of 2 feet,<br /><br />
perspective_scale = 1 + (0.7 ft / 2 ft) = 1.35<br /><br />
To get a stronger depth cue, using exaggerated perspective, you can use
larger perspective scale values.</p>
<p>The <span class="GUI">Alignment depth</span> slider can be used to shift
objects in or out of the screen, in order to change their relative size (depth
scaling) or clipping.</p>
<p>
When perspective is in use, the viewing volume indicator (shown in green in the
<a href="../workspace/clipping_planes.html">clipping planes window</a>) takes a
trapezoidal shape that reflects the perspective scale.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<a name="fog"></a>
<h3>Fog tab</h3>
<p>The Fog feature helps facilitate 3D viewing by providing emphasis on
the parts of the structure that are closest to you. Closer parts of the
molecule appear in the pure currently selected atom color, and more
distant parts appear to turn gray and finally disappear into the
background. Fog can be useful when hardware-assisted stereo viewing is
not available, but it is also helpful when used in conjunction with stereo
viewing.</p>

<dl>
<dt><span class="GUI">Display fog</span> option menu</dt>
<dd><p>Select the conditions under which fogging is used.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="GUI">Automatic</span>&mdash;Turn fog on if there are more than
40 atoms in the Workspace. </li>
<li><span class="GUI">On</span>&mdash;turn fogging on for all atoms</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Off</span>&mdash;turn fogging off for all atoms</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also do this with the <span class="GUI">Fog</span> button menu on the 
<span class="GUI">View</span> toolbar in the main window.<br style="margin-bottom: 10px;" />
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/fog.png" />
<br style="margin-bottom: 10px;" />
</p>
</dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Display fog on atom labels</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Apply fogging to atom labels as well as to atoms. 
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Method</span> option menu</dt>
<dd><p>This option menu contains three fogging gradient types:
<span class="GUI">Linear</span>, <span class="GUI">Exponential</span>, and
<span class="GUI">Exponential Squared</span>. Currently, only the
<span class="GUI">Linear</span> method should be used when displaying in
perspective.</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Linear Start</span> and
<span class="GUI">Linear End</span> sliders</dt>
<dd><p>The <span class="GUI">Linear Start</span> and <span class="GUI">Linear
End</span> sliders allow you to increase
or decrease the range of available colors created by fog gradations.
<span class="GUI">Linear Start</span> moves the plane that defines the fog
boundary that is closest to the screen. <span class="GUI">Linear End</span>
moves the fog boundary that is behind the structure. There is a finite number of
gradations, and if there is empty space, some of them are wasted.</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Density</span> slider</dt>
<dd><p>This slider allows you to increase the contrast of colors created by the
fogging feature. Closer portions of the structure will appear even brighter and
more distant ones will more quickly converge on the background color.</p></dd>
</dl>

<a name="effects"></a>
<h3>Effects tab</h3>

<p>This tab allows you to apply special effects to the Workspace. The effects
are calculated for the full screen for each pixel. The effects can be turned on
and off using the checkboxes. The available effects are as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Antialiasing</span>&mdash;smooth the edges of objects
so they don't appear jagged. This effect does not antialias semi-transparent
objects. The <span class="GUI">Full-scene antialiasing</span> preference (under 
<a href="../maestro_menu/preferences.html#workspace_graphics"><span
class="GUI">Workspace &ndash; Graphics</span></a>) does, but it does not
antialias spheres and cylinders (balls and sticks). For the smoothest edges, use
both the preference and the screen effect.
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Ambient occlusion</span>&mdash;enhance the perception
of depth by taking into account the ambient lighting blocked by other objects.
The <span class="GUI">Enhanced depth view</span> preference (under 
<a href="../maestro_menu/preferences.html#workspace_depth"><span
class="GUI">Workspace &ndash; Depth view</span></a>) uses ambient
occlusion based on atoms, and is only available for structures in CPK
representation.  This option is available for any structure, but is most useful
for large structures in CPK representation and with molecular surfaces. </p>
<p>You can set the intensity of the darkening effect with the <span
class="GUI">Intensity</span> slider and box. The intensity is represented as a
percentage, with 0 corresponding to no effect. </p>
<p>You can also change the range of the effect, with the <span
class="GUI">Radius</span> slider. Any screen object within the specified radius
of a pixel is considered to occlude the pixel. Thus, the smaller the radius, the
more local and &quot;sharp&quot; the effect, At a very small radius, the effect
is like outlines.
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Outlines</span>&mdash;Add a thin outline to
objects in the Workspace. The color of the outline can be set by clicking the
<span class="GUI">Color</span> button and choosing a color in the color selector
that opens. The new color is shown on the color button. The width of the outline
in pixels can be changed in the <span class="GUI">Width</span> box, from 0 to
10.
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Cartoon shading</span>&mdash;Use cartoon shading, in
which the color or shading is done in steps rather than continuously. You can
specify the number of steps in the <span class="GUI">Steps</span> box, which can
take values from 2 to 10. 
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This tab is not present if the OpenGL level is 1.2, as it requires features
that are not present at this OpenGL level.
