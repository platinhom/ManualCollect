<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>The <span class="GUI">Superposition</span> panel can be used to perform
rigid-body superposition of the structures that are included in the Workspace,
or the structures that are selected in the Project Table, based on corresponding
atom pairs defined by selection, ASL, or a SMARTS pattern.  </p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Superposition Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Superposition</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Tasks &rarr; Superposition</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
</ul>


<p>This panel is dockable, so it opens by default in the Workspace. You can
change this behavior in the <a href="../maestro_menu/preferences.html"><span
class="GUI">Preferences</span> panel</a>, under <span class="GUI">General
&ndash; Panels</span>.
</p>

<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Superposition Panel</h2> 


<p>To superimpose structures using the <span class="GUI">Superposition</span>
panel, you must first include the structures you want to superimpose in the
Workspace, then define the atoms that are to be used in the superposition.</p>

<p>If you want to superimpose two structures, you can pick the pairs of
corresponding atoms in each structure by hand. To do this, select <span
class="GUI">Pick atom pairs</span> in the <span class="GUI">Atom Pairs</span>
tab and pick one atom from each structure. The first atom in any pair must
always come from the same structure, and the second from the other structure of
the two. If <span class="GUI">Show markers</span> is selected, the atom pair is
connected by a dotted line, and the selected atom pair has a thicker dotted
line.  You can delete atom pairs by clicking <span class="GUI">Delete</span>, or
start again by clicking <span class="GUI">Delete All</span>. After picking one
pair, the <span class="GUI">Superimpose Atom Pairs</span> button
becomes active. When you click this button, the superposition is performed on
the specified atom pairs, by moving the second structure over the first.</p>

<p>The superposition depends on how many atom pairs you pick. If you pick one
pair, a simple translation is performed. If you pick two pairs, the vector
between the two atoms in the second structure is aligned to the vector between
the two atoms in the first, and the centroids of the vectors are made to
coincide. For three atom pairs, the structure is rotated and translated so that
the three atoms coincide.  For more atom pairs, the RMSD of the atom pairs
between the structure is minimized to determine the best superposition.</p>

<p>If you want to superimpose many structures, or if you don't want to pick atom
pairs by hand, you can define the atoms to superimpose by an ASL expression or
by a SMARTS expression. </p>

<p>In the <span class="GUI">ASL</span> tab, you can superimpose all atoms by
clicking <span class="GUI">All</span>, create an ASL expression from the
Workspace selection by clicking <span class="GUI">Selection</span>, enter an ASL
expression in the text box, or set up the ASL expression in the
<a href="../misc/asd.html"><span class="GUI">Atom Selection</span>
dialog box</a>. The superposition is performed when you click
<span class="GUI">All</span> or
<span class="GUI">Selection</span>, press
<span class="GUI">ENTER</span> in the text box, or click
<span class="GUI">OK</span> in the
<span class="GUI">Atom Selection</span> dialog box.
</p>

<p>In the <span class="GUI">SMARTS</span> tab, you
can create a SMARTS string from the Workspace selection by clicking
<span class="GUI">Get from selection</span>, or enter a SMARTS string
in the text box. The superposition is performed when you click
<span class="GUI">Get from selection</span> or press
<span class="GUI">ENTER</span> in the text box. </p>

<p>The structures that you superimpose need not be conformers, but if they are
not, you must be careful to define atoms to superimpose that have
corresponding atoms in all structures that are superimposed. </p>

<p>One common task is to to superimpose a number of conformers based on a subset
of atoms. To do this include all the conformers in the Workspace and use
the <a href="#feature5">Superimpose by ASL</a> feature or
the <a href="#feature6">Superimpose by SMARTS</a> feature. </p>

<p>When you superimpose structures, the structures are moved to minimize the RMS
distance between the selected atoms in each structure and the corresponding
atoms in the reference structure. If you superimpose by picking atom pairs, the
structure that contains the first atom picked is the reference structure. If you
define the superposition atoms using ASL or SMARTS, the
reference structure is the entry that has the lowest row number in the Project
Table. If you want to select a particular entry as the reference structure, you
can reorder the Project Table entries. </p>

<p>You can undo the superposition by clicking the <span class="GUI">Undo</span>
button on the <a href="../tool_bar/main_edit_toolbar.html"><span
class="GUI">Edit</span> toolbar</a>. The structures return to their original
locations, but the RMSD values are retained in the <span class="GUI">RMSD</span>
text box. However, any property created by the superposition is removed.</p>

<p>You can clear the <span class="GUI">RMSD</span> text box by clicking the 
<span class="GUI">Clear</span> button.
</p>

<p>If you want to superimpose the centers of mass of several entries, you can
select them in the Workspace, then right-click and choose 
<span class="GUI">Align Centers of Mass</span>.

<dd><p>These options specify the source of structures for the superposition.
<span class="GUI">Included entries</span> superimposes the entries in the
Workspace. <span class="GUI">Selected entries</span> superimposes the entries
that are selected in the Project Table. The reference structure is the structure
with the lowest row number in the Project Table.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature4"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Calculate 'in place' (no transformation)</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>By default, Maestro moves the structures to superimpose them.  If this
option is selected, the superposition is done without moving the
structures. Instead, the RMS and maximum distance is calculated for the
current set of atoms in their existing positions.</p>

<p>If you want to preserve the structures' location but perform the
superposition, you can undo the transformation of the structures by clicking the
<span class="GUI">Undo</span> button on the <a
href="../tool_bar/main_edit_toolbar.html"><span class="GUI">Edit</span>
toolbar</a>. However, if you created a property, the property creation is also
undone.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature6"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Create RMSD property</span> option
</dt>
<dd><p>If this option is selected, the RMS difference between superposition
atoms is added to the entry as a property. The property is labeled &quot;RMSD
<i>entry-ID</i>&quot; or &quot;RMS In Place <i>entry-name</i>&quot;, where
<i>entry-ID</i> is the reference entry (the entry on which all others are
superimposed).  </p></dd>

<a name="feature1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Atom pairs</span> tab
</dt>
<dd><p>The <span class="GUI">Atom Pairs</span> tab provides tools for manual
selection of atom pairs for superposition.</p>

<p>The <span class="GUI">Superimpose by atom pairs</span> text area displays the
list of atom pairs that is used to superimpose the entries. The current pair is
highlighted. You can only select one atom pair at a time. 
</p>

<p>The <span class="GUI">Delete</span> button removes the selected
atom pair from the list. The <span class="GUI">Delete All</span> button
clears the atom pair list.
</p>

<p><span class="GUI">Pick atom pairs</span> option: When this option is
selected, you can pick atom pairs for superposition by clicking on a pair of
atoms in the Workspace. For each pair, the first atom must come from the same
structure in a pair of structures, and the second from the other structure. The
structures must belong to different entries. </p>

<p><span class="GUI">Show Markers</span> option:
When this option is selected, Maestro connects defined atom pairs with
dashed orange lines. The currently selected atom pair is distinguished by a
thicker line.</p>

<p><span class="GUI">Superimpose Atom Pairs</span> button:
Click this button to perform the superposition. </p>
</dd>

<a name="feature2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">ASL</span> tab
</dt>
<dd><p>The <span class="GUI">ASL</span> tab provides tools to select atoms in a
structure for superimposition, using an ASL expression.</p>
<p>The <span class="GUI">All</span> button selects all atoms in the
Workspace.<br />
The <span class="GUI">Selection</span> button uses the Workspace selection
to define the ASL expression.<br />
The <span class="GUI">Select</span> button opens the
<a href="../misc/asd.html"><span class="GUI">Atom Selection</span> dialog
box</a> for setting up the ASL expression.<br />
The text box can be used to enter the ASL expression directly. It also displays
the ASL expression generated by the three buttons.</p>

<p>The ASL expression (from the text box or the dialog box) is applied to each
entry in turn. Then an attempt is made to superimpose corresponding atoms in
turn, from the Nth entry to the 1st entry. This method is usually only useful
when the structures involved are conformers. </p>

<p>When you click <span class="GUI">All</span>, the superposition is done with
the maximum use of local symmetry. You can also type <code>all</code> in the
text box, or make a selection in the Atom Selection dialog box, but the
superposition does not use symmetry in this case, and you may get different
results as a consequence.</p>
</dd>

<a name="feature3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">SMARTS</span> tab</dt>
<dd><p>The <span class="GUI">SMARTS</span> tab allows you to specify a SMARTS
expression to be used for the superposition. </p>
<p>The <span class="GUI">Get from selection</span> button
creates a SMARTS expression from the Workspace selection.
The text box can be used to enter the SMARTS expression directly. It also
displays the SMARTS expression generated by the <span class="GUI">Get from
selection</span> button. 
You can set preferences for inclusion of notational elements in the generated
SMARTS pattern in the <span class="GUI">Preferences</span> panel, under 
<a href="../maestro_menu/preferences.html#smarts"><span class="GUI">SMARTS
generation</span></a>.</p>
<p>The SMARTS expression (from the text box or the dialog box) is applied to each
entry in turn. Then an attempt is made to superimpose corresponding atoms in
turn, from the Nth entry to the 1st entry. This method is usually only useful
when the structures involved are conformers. </p></dd>

<a name="feature7"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">C-alpha</span> tab</dt>
<dd><p>This tab allows you to superimpose protein structures using the C-alpha
carbons as the atoms to superimpose. You can choose one of the entries as the
fixed entry, and superimpose all the others onto this entry. To choose the
entry, click <span class="GUI">Choose</span>, and choose an entry in the dialog
box that opens. The fixed entry must be one of the entries you chose for
superposition. When you have chosen the fixed entry, click <span
class="GUI">Superimpose</span> to superimpose the entries.</p>
<p>The superposition is done starting from the first C-alpha in each protein.
This feature is mainly useful for very similar proteins - for example, mutants
of a parent protein. If you want to take sequence alignment into account, you
should instead use the <a href="protein_structure_alignment.html"><span
class="GUI">Protein Structure Alignment</span> panel</a>.</p></dd>

<a name="feature8"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">RMSD</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>After two structures have been superimposed, the RMS difference between
all the superposition atoms is displayed in the <span class="GUI">RMSD</span>
read-only text area. Also displayed is the maximum distance between the atoms of
the most different atom pair. You can clear the text box with the <span
class="GUI">Clear</span> button.</p></dd> 

<a name="feature9"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Clear</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Clear the text in the RMSD text box. The text accumulates with each RMSD
calculated.
