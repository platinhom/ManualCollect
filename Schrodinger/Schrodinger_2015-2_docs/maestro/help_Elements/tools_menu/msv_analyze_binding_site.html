<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Calculate sequence identity in multiple alignment columns that are within a
certain spatial distance from ligand residues, and filter the alignment
sequences based on the sequence identity.
</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Analyze Binding Sites Dialog Box</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Analyze Binding Sites</span> dialog box, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Tools &rarr; Analyze Binding Site</span> in the 
<span class="GUI">Multiple Sequence Viewer</span> panel.</p>
</li></ul>


<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Analyze Binding Sites Dialog Box</h2> 


<p>To analyze a binding site, you must have a sequence and a structure for
the query, and the structure must have at least one ligand (it can have
more). Next, you must have a set of sequences that are aligned to the query,
which you can obtain from a BLAST search followed by an alignment. If you want
to do the analysis for sequences other than the query, you must have structures
with ligands for those sequences. 
</p>

<p>When you open the dialog box, the query sequence is analyzed and annotated
with ligand contacts (for all ligands), and the columns for the residues that
are in contact with the ligand (or first ligand) are selected. Sequences that
have 100% identity with the query residues that are in contact with the ligand
(or the first ligand) are also selected by default.
</p>

<p>The dialog box opens at the <span class="GUI">Conservation Analysis</span>
tab. If you want to select and remove sequences that are similar to the query or
different from the query in the active site, you can use the tools in this
tab.</p>

<p>The <span class="GUI">Distance Analysis</span> tab is useful for examining
the average conservation within a set of sequences. The analysis could be
repeated for different queries to obtain a comparison of the average
conservation for the queries. 
</p>

<p>You can change the sequence and select the ligand with the <span 
class="GUI">Sequence</span> and <span class="GUI">Ligand</span> option menus.
When you change the sequence, the new sequence is analyzed and annotated and the
column selection updated for the new ligand. Changing the ligand updates the
column selection.

<dl>

<a name="feature1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Sequence</span> option menu</dt>
<dd><p>Choose the sequence from this option menu. The analysis is done on the
basis of the chosen sequence. This means that the sequence you choose must have
an associated structure with a ligand. 
</p></dd>

<a name="feature2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Ligand</span> option menu</dt>
<dd><p>Choose the ligand for the sequence from this option menu, if the
structure for the sequence has more than one ligand. The column selection
changes to represent contact with the chosen ligand.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Conservation Analysis</span> tab</dt>
<dd><p>In this tab you can select sequences based on the degree of conservation
of residues in the active site (i.e. residues that are in contact with the
ligand).
</p>

<dl>

<dt><span class="GUI">Sequence identity threshold in selected columns</span> slider</dt>
<dd><p>Use this slider to adjust the percentage sequence identity threshold for
selecting sequences in the <span class="GUI">Multiple Sequence Viewer</span>
panel. As you change the value, the selection is updated to reflect the new
threshold. The default is 100%, so only sequences that are completely identical
for the active site residues are selected by default.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Remove Similar Sequences</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>For the current threshold, remove sequences from the 
<span class="GUI">Multiple Sequence Viewer</span> panel whose sequence identity
in the active site is greater than the threshold. This is useful if you are
looking for mutations in the active site and want to eliminate sequences that
are the same or very similar in the active site. 
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Remove Divergent Sequences</span> buttons</dt>
<dd><p>For the current threshold, remove sequences from the 
<span class="GUI">Multiple Sequence Viewer</span> panel whose sequence identity
in the active site is smaller than the threshold. This is useful if you are
looking for sequences that are the same or very similar in the active site, but
may diverge elsewhere. 
</p></dd>

</dl>

</dd>

<a name="feature4"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Distance Analysis</span> tab</dt>
<dd><p>In this tab you can analyze the average identity, similarity, and
homology of the residues in the alignment to the query residues that are within
a range of distances of the ligand.
</p>

<dl>

<dt>Distance table</dt>
<dd><p>This table reports the results of the analysis. Each row represents a
neighborhood of the selected residues. The first column is the distance cutoff
for that neighborhood: any residue that has a heavy atom within that distance of
a heavy atom in the selection is considered to be in that neighborhood. The
remaining columns contain the identity, similarity and homology values
calculated for the columns within the alignment that include the residues within
the distance threshold.  
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Scan from <i>N</i> to <i>M</i> angstroms</span> boxes</dt>
<dd><p>Specify the range of distances over which the analysis is performed. 
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Export results to CSV file</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Export the table data to a CSV file. Opens a file selector, in which you
can navigate to a location and name the file. 
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Analyze</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Analyze the residues in the alignment for their identity, similarity, and
homology to the query residues that are within the specified distance threshold
of the ligand.
