<p>The following UNIX environment variables affect the way that Maestro runs.
Generally only the first, <code>SCHRODINGER</code>, needs to be set since most
of the others are automatically set based on <code>SCHRODINGER</code> if they
are not defined, or have defined defaults. <code>SCHRODINGER</code> is normally
set to the top-level location of the installation. You can, however, explicitly
define any of these before running Maestro. In that case, Maestro uses the value
you define.</p>

<table border=1>

<tr>
<td><code>SCHRODINGER</code></td>
<td>Top-level directory of the installation.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><code>SCHRODINGER_DOCS</code></td>
<td>Top-level directory of the documentation. The default is 
<code>$SCHRODINGER/docs</code>.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><code>SCHRODINGER_HELP_DIR</code></td>
<td>Directory that contains the online help. The default is 
<code>$SCHRODINGER/docs/maestro/help_Elements</code>.
</td></tr>

<tr>
<td><code>DISPLAY</code></td>
<td>Specifies the name of the display machine.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><code>SCHRODINGER_TEMP_PROJECT</code></td>
<td>Location that Maestro uses for temporary projects. The default is
<code>$HOME/.schrodinger/tmp</code>. If you have limited space in your home file
system, you might want to set this variable to a directory on a larger file
system. You might also want to set this variable to a directory on a local disk,
to improve the speed of project operations.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><code>SCHRODINGER_TEMP_LOCATION</code></td>
<td>Location of some temporary files, including files used for communication
with other programs and files used by the help system. The default location is
<code>$SCHRODINGER_TEMP_PROJECT/</code><i>pid</i>, where 
<i>pid</i> is the Maestro process ID. 
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><code>SCHRODINGER_GL</code></td>
<td>
Specifies use of the Schr&ouml;dinger-supplied OpenGL library (instead of using
the default system OpenGL library).  Equivalent to using the <code>-sgl</code>
command line option. Normally this should not be needed unless you are
experiencing problems using the system OpenGL library.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><code>MMSITEDIR</code></td>
<td>Typically set to <code>$SCHRODINGER/mmshare-v</code><i>version</i><code>/data</code> 
by the startup script. This is a backup location for system-wide aliases, and should not be
set by the user. </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><code>MMRESDIR</code></td>
<td>Directory containing system-wide Maestro startup and resource files.
One of the locations in which Maestro looks for a startup
command file, <code>maestro.cmd</code>. This is a backup location,
and should not be set by the user.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><code>MMXRESDIR</code></td>
<td>Directory containing Maestro X Windows resource files.</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>Maestro also sets a range of other environment variables on startup. These
are listed in the terminal window where Maestro was started. You should not set
any of these environment variables yourself. </p>

<p>When Maestro starts, it attempts to find a file called <code>maestro.cmd</code>.
If it does, it loads the contents and executes the Maestro commands in this file.
The order in which it looks and executes is: </p>
<pre>
$MMRESDIR/maestro.cmd
~/.schrodinger/maestro<i>vv</i>/maestro.cmd
</pre>
<p>where <i>vv</i> is the 2-digit Maestro version. If it finds both of these
files, they are executed in the above order. In this way, the user command file
overrides the standard, system-wide command file.</p>

<p>Once this is done Maestro attempts to read in the aliases (see related topics
for more information) that are located in a file called <code>alias.cmd</code>.
It searches the following locations and the first instance of
<code>alias.cmd</code> it finds is the one it executes.  No subsequent searching
is done after that. </p>
<pre>
$PWD
~/.schrodinger/maestro<i>vv</i>
$MMSITEDIR
$MMRESDIR
$MMXRESDIR
</pre>

<p>Note that <code>MMXRESDIR</code> is for X resources so it is ill-advised to
place an <code>alias.cmd</code> file in that directory.  The recommended
locations are the current directory or
<code>~/.schrodinger/maestro</code><i>vv</i>. </p>
