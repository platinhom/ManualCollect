<h2>Using the 2D Workspace Panel</h2> 


<p>To start drawing, click the <span class="GUI">Draw</span> button
</p>
<img src="../images/common/sketcher/draw.png" />
<p>
Drawing creates a carbon-atom framework. You can change the element with the
element buttons, either during drawing or after you have finished drawing.</p>
<p>
The first atom is placed by clicking in the drawing area. It is shown as
CH<sub>4</sub>. After placing the first atom, you can draw in several ways:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Click on an atom to place a new atom and draw a bond to it from the
clicked atom. The bond is placed in a default orientation with respect to
existing bonds. 
</p></li>
<li><p>Drag from an atom in a particular direction, to place a new atom and draw
a bond from the clicked atom to the new atom in the chosen direction.
</p></li>
<li><p>Drag from an atom to another atom to create a bond between the two atoms.
</p></li>
<li><p>Hold down shift and drag from an atom to add a linear chain to that
atom. 
</p></li>
<li><p>Click on a bond to increase its bond order.
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The &quot;active&quot; atom&mdash;the one to which a new bond will be
attached&mdash; is indicated by a gray filled circle.  Likewise, the active bond
is indicated by a thicker gray line. The active atom or bond changes as you move
the pointer over the atoms or bonds. 
</p>

<p>You can also start your drawing with a ring: click on the ring in the
toolbar, then click in the drawing area to place the ring. Likewise, you can
start drawing with a custom fragment by clicking on it in the 
<span class="GUI">User defined fragments</span> toolbar, then clicking in
the drawing area.
</p>

<p><b>To draw bonds with a particular stereochemistry</b>, click the <span
class="GUI">Wedge Bond</span> or <span class="GUI">Dashed Bond</span>
button,</p>
<img src="../images/common/sketcher/wedge_bond.png" />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img src="../images/common/sketcher/dashed_bond.png" />
<p>
and draw in the drawing area. Clicking on a bond changes its stereochemistry;
clicking on an atom adds a new atom with the selected orientation. 
</p>
<p><b>To add rings to your system</b>, click on one of the ring buttons, then
click in the drawing area. When you move the pointer into the drawing area, the
ring is shown in blue. As you move the pointer in the drawing area, the ring
&quot;snaps&quot; to positions that show a potential attachment of the ring to
the structure.  Clicking when the ring is in one of these positions places the
ring at that position, and its color changes to black.
</p>
<p><b>To replace functional groups</b>, pause the pointer over the atom you want
to replace with the group, then type in the group name or a SMARTS pattern and
press <span class="Keys">Enter</span>. Many common functional groups are
recognized: the list is given below with the corresponding SMARTS patterns.
You must ensure that the valence is properly satisfied by the group you choose.
</p>
<p><b>To add functional groups</b>, pause the pointer over the atom you want to
add the group to, type <code>-</code> then type in the group name or a SMARTS
pattern and press <span class="Keys">Enter</span>. Many common functional groups
are recognized: the list is given below with the corresponding SMARTS patterns.

<p><b>To change the element</b>, you can do one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pause the pointer over the atom, then type the element symbol.</li>
<li>Click the button for the desired element on the toolbar, then click an atom
in the structure.</li>
<li>Type the element symbol, then click an atom in the structure.</li>
</ul>
<p>The last two of these choices allow you to click on multiple atoms to change
the element; the first operates only on the active atom.
</p>
<p><b>To assign a formal charge</b>, click the <span class="GUI">Increase
Charge</span> button or the <span class="GUI">Decrease Charge</span> button,
</p>
<img src="../images/common/sketcher/increase_charge.png" />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img src="../images/common/sketcher/decrease_charge.png" />
<p>then click on an atom. The formal charge is given next to the atom, and any
hydrogens are also shown that are needed to complete the valence for the atom;
or a red underline is shown to indicate that the valence is not satisfied.
You can also pause the pointer over an atom and type in the formal charge. Any
combination of numbers and &plus; and &minus; are accepted. 
</p>

<p><b>To move a group</b>, first select the group by drawing around it with the
<span class="GUI">Lasso</span> tool</p>
<img src="../images/common/sketcher/lasso.png" />
<p>If you want to translate it, just drag it to the new location. If you want to
rotate it, click the <span class="GUI">Rotate</span> button, </p>
<img src="../images/common/sketcher/rotate.png" />
<p>then drag it to the new orientation. The angle is displayed as you drag.
</p>

<p><b>To save a structure as a project entry</b>, provide a title in the <span
class="GUI">Entry title</span> text box, then click <span class="GUI">Create
Entry</span>. If you have a LigPrep license, you can convert it to 3D by
selecting <span class="GUI">Convert to 3D</span>; otherwise it is added as a 2D
structure, and you must convert it to 3D if you want to use it for calculations.
</p>
<p><b>To save an image</b> of the structure in PNG, JPEG, or BMP format, press
<span class="Keys">Ctrl+Alt+P</span> (<span
class="Keys">&#x2325;&#x2318;P</span>). A dialog box opens, in which you can
specify the size of the image and the background transparency. When you click
<span class="GUI">OK</span>, a file selector opens, in which you can
navigate to the location and name the file. The image type is determined by the
file extension.
</p>
<p><b>To save a structure for drawing</b>, press <span class="Keys">Ctrl</span>
(<span class="Keys">&#x2318;</span>) and drag the structure to
the <span class="GUI">User-defined fragments</span> toolbar. If you want to
delete it, click the structure on the toolbar and
press <span class="Keys">Delete</span> or <span class="Keys">Backspace</span>.

<h3>Toolbar</h3>
<p>The main toolbar has three sets of buttons. The first set of buttons is for
performing actions, which are described below. The second set is a collection of
rings that you can add to the structure. The third set is a collection of
elements, which you can use to change atoms to a chosen element. The selection
of the element can also be done by typing the element symbol (case insensitive).
</p>

<p>In addition to the main toolbar, there is a <span class="GUI">User-defined
fragments</span> toolbar, which you can display from the 
<span class="GUI">View</span> menu. To add a structure to this toolbar, hold
down <span class="Keys">Ctrl</span> (<span class="Keys">&#x2318;</span>) and
drag the structure to the toolbar. To delete a structure from this toolbar,
click on the button for the structure and press <span class="Keys">Delete</span>
or <span class="Keys">Backspace</span>. You can use the structures on this
toolbar in the same way as the ring fragments on the main toolbar: click the
button, then click in the drawing area.

<h3>Drawing area</h3>
<p>The drawing area shows the structure and is used to build or edit
structures. You can pan the view with the right mouse button, and rotate
it with the middle mouse button. You can zoom in and out with the mouse wheel,
and you can scroll the drawing area with the scroll bars. The area is large, so
it is possible to place a number of structures in it.
</p>
<p>When the pointer is over an atom, it becomes the active atom, to which
drawing operations are applied: bonding to a new carbon atom,
changing element (by typing the element symbol), adding or replacing the
functional group (by typing a group name or SMARTS string and pressing <span
class="Keys">Enter</span>).
</p>
<p>When the pointer is over a bond and you are drawing with one of
the three bond types, the bond becomes active. You can change it to a wedge
or dashed bond, or increase the bond order, depending on the bond type.
</p>

<p>When a ring is selected, the ring is shown in blue. As you move the pointer
in the drawing area, the ring &quot;snaps&quot; to positions that show a
potential attachment of the ring to the structure.  Clicking when the ring is in
one of these positions places the ring at that position, and its color changes
to black.
</p>

<p>Right-clicking on an atom displays a shortcut menu that allows you to make
settings for that atom:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Set stereochemistry to R</span>&mdash;Set the
stereochemistry at this atom to R. This option is only available for chiral
centers. The appropriate bonds are changed to wedge or dotted to reflect the
stereochemistry. 
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Set stereochemistry to S</span>&mdash;Set the
stereochemistry at this atom to S. This option is only available for chiral
centers. The appropriate bonds are changed to wedge or dotted to reflect the
stereochemistry.
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Set allowed atoms</span>&mdash;Enter a list of atoms
that are allowed at the current center in the <span class="GUI">Edit
Atom</span> dialog box, which opens when you choose this item.
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Set as any wildcard</span>&mdash;Allow any atom to be
present at this center. The atom symbol is set to Q<i>n</i>, where <i>n</i> is a
numerical suffix to distinguish different &quot;wildcard&quot; atoms. A text
label is also placed in the Workspace reading &quot;Q<i>n</i> = Any atom&quot;.
</p></li>

<li><p><span class="GUI">Set R group</span>&mdash;Mark the atom as an R group.
The submenu has items for <span class="GUI">R1</span> through 
<span class="GUI">R6</span>, and an <span class="GUI">Rn</span> item to set the
index if needed to a value greater than 6. You can label more than one center
with the same R group label.
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>You can add a structure to the <span class="GUI">User-defined
fragments</span> toolbar by holding down <span class="Keys">Ctrl</span>
(<span class="Keys">&#x2318;</span>) and dragging the structure to the
toolbar. If the toolbar is not displayed, choose <span class="GUI">View &rarr;

<h3>Entry creation controls</h3>
<p>These controls enable you to create an entry from the structure in the
sketcher. When you do so, any &quot;wildcard&quot; atoms or bonds are converted
using the first member of the list for the atom or bond.
