<p>Scenes are a means of storing multiple independent &quot;snapshots&quot; of a
project or a part of a project. They are stored inside the project, and can be
used as sub-projects, or exported to create presentations.
</p>

<p>Scenes include the entries that you choose for the scene, along with any
associated data such as surfaces, hypotheses, and so on; the project table
state; and commands that set up the Workspace as it was when the scene was
created, such as display options, measurements, and so on. 
</p>

<p>Scenes do not include panel layout or state (including Workspace
layout). When a scene is created, it does not contain plots, data from
CombiGlide, Prime, or Phase runs, and job data, because these could contain
information on entries that are not in the scene. They can be added after the
scene is created. 
</p>

<p>You can work in a scene that you are viewing just like you can in the project
itself: add or delete entries, run jobs, create plots, and so on. However, to
keep the changes you must either overwrite the old scene, or create a new
scene. If you exit the scene without saving it, the changes are discarded.
</p>

<p>When you open a scene, a special toolbar is displayed below the Workspace
area, which contains a button to close the scene, navigation tools to step
through the scenes, and a text box that indicates which scene is being shown,
with the first line of the description. Because scenes are projects, stepping to
the next scene involves closing a project and opening a new project. The speed
of this operation depends on how big the scene is.
</p>

<p>To create a scene, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Workspace &rarr; Scenes &rarr; New</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>

</ul>

<p>To view a scene, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Workspace &rarr; Scenes &rarr; View</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>

</ul>

<p>To manage scenes (add, delete, rearrange, export), you can: 
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Workspace &rarr; Scenes &rarr; Manage</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>

</ul>
<p>The <a href="manage_scenes.html"><span class="GUI">Manage Scenes</span>
panel</a> opens.</p>
