<p><b>To center any atom in the Workspace</b>, just right-click on that atom. 
For PrimeX users, right-clicking also centers the electron density on that
atom.</p>

<p>The <b>yellow highlighted region at the bottom of the main Maestro window</b> has
helpful instructions, such as the action to be applied when picking atoms, or a
description of menu items. This region (&quot;Autohelp&quot;) is updated as
various windows are opened or toolbar buttons are used to select an action.</p> 

<p><b>Molecular rendering</b> can be controlled from the 
<span class="GUI">Molecular representation &ndash; Atoms and bonds</span>
section of the 
<a href="../maestro_menu/preferences.html#representation_bonds"><span
class="GUI">Preferences</span> panel</a>.
Here, you can modify molecular rendering options such as line width thickness,
resolution, etc.</p>

<p>Use the <span class="GUI">Molecule Number</span> or <span
class="GUI">Molecule Number (Carbons)</span> color scheme to 
rapidly <b>identify a noncovalently bound ligand</b> in a protein as well as any
<b>chain breaks</b> that might be present.</p>

<p><b>Holding down the right mouse button</b> over an atom in the Workspace
provides quick access to many useful operations, such as changing the molecular
representation, coloring atoms, and even mutating amino acids.
See <a href="../workspace/shortcut_menus.html">Main Window Shortcut Menus</a>
for more information.</p>

<p><b>Surfaces can be clipped</b> separately from atoms in the Workspace. First,
display the clipping planes window by choosing 
<span class="GUI">Window &rarr; Clipping Planes</span>.
Next, right-click in the clipping planes window and choose <span
class="GUI">Surfaces</span> from the shortcut menu. Drag the orange lines to
adjust clipping of the surfaces. 
See <a href="../workspace/clipping_planes.html">Clipping Planes Window</a> for
more information.</p> 
<p>There are many <b>keyboard shortcuts</b> in Maestro. For example, <span
class="Keys">Ctrl+G</span> (<span class="Keys">&#x2318;G</span>) switches
between local and global transformations for a molecule, and 
<span class="Keys">Ctrl+L</span> (<span class="Keys">&#x2318;L</span>) tiles the
Workspace . For a full list of shortcuts, see <a href="keys.html">Using the
Keyboard in Maestro</a>.</p>

<p><b>Function keys can be customized</b> to your needs. 
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Maestro &rarr; Function Key Macros</span>
to open the <span class="GUI">Function Key Macros</span> panel.
<span class="GUI">F2</span> through <span class="GUI">F12</span> can now
be programmed to perform a set of desired operations. <span
class="GUI">F1</span> is reserved for opening the help.</p>
<p>The <b>Protein Preparation Wizard</b>  provides an interactive way to set up
your protein system. Many operations can be automatically performed, such as
assigning bond orders, generating a set of reasonable ionization and tautomeric
states for ligands, predicting rotameric states for Asn, Gln, and His,
optimizing hydroxyl and thiol torsions, and performing a constrained
minimization on the system. Use the <span class="GUI">Prep Wiz</span> toolbar
button to open it.</p>

<p><b>Jobs can be monitored</b> and controlled through our Job Control facility,
which is available in Maestro by choosing 
<span class="GUI">Applications &rarr; Monitor Jobs</span> or 
<span class="GUI">Tasks &rarr; Monitor Jobs</span>, or from the 
command line by typing <code>$SCHRODINGER/jobcontrol</code>.</p> 

<p><b>Saving a project</b> allows you to keep a running &quot;lab book&quot; of
your work. Once a project is saved the first time, the work you do in that
project is automatically saved. It can also be shared with your colleagues. The
same Maestro project can be opened on all platforms.</p>

<p><b>To select one or more rows in the Project Table</b> (highlighted yellow),
use control- and shift-click. Operations can be performed on this entire set by
right-clicking. The set of selected entries can also be dragged up or down to
move these rows as a block in the Project Table.</p>

<p><b>Properties in the Project Table</b> can easily be hidden and
program-specific subsets can be selected by choosing <span class="GUI">Property
&rarr; Show</span> menu and making your selection. For example, to show only the
properties that have values for at least one of the selected entries, choose
<span class="GUI">For Selected Entries</span>. </p>

<p>Use the ePlayer <b>to perform repetitive operations on entries</b> in the
Project Table. In the Project Table, choose <span class="GUI">Options</span>
from the <span class="GUI">ePlayer</span> menu to specify a command file to run
on each selected entry.</p> 

<p>To <b>copy a property value to other rows</b> in the same column, first
select the rows, then edit the property value and press <span
class="Keys">Ctrl+Enter</span> (<span class="Keys">&#x2318;Enter</span>).
</p>

<p><b>Right-click on the blue header cells of the Project Table</b> for useful
options, such as sorting, setting displayed decimal places, clearing values, and
adjusting column width. </p> 

<p>The <span class="GUI">Build</span> toolbar provides an easy way to 
<b>build molecules in the Workspace</b>. The pencil, usually the first button on
the <span class="GUI">Build</span> toolbar, can be used to sketch molecules or
connect existing molecules with bonds.</p>

<p><b>Global preferences</b> can be set in the <span class="GUI">Preferences</span>
panel (<span class="GUI">Maestro</span> menu). To set additional
Maestro startup preferences, create or edit your <code>maestro.cmd</code>
file (in the <code>maestro</code><i>nn</i> directory of your Schr&ouml;dinger
user resources directory). For example, to customize the display settings and
change some default Glide options:</p>
<pre>
repall tuberadius=0.18
prefer workspacemenushow=true
ribbon display=both
glidesettings maxatom=200
glidesettings maxrotbonds=35
</pre>
<p>A complete list of commands can be found in the 
<a href="../../maestro_command_reference.pdf"
target="pdfmanuals">Maestro Command Reference Manual</a>.</p>

<p><b>Commands corresponding to the tasks performed in Maestro</b> are logged in
the Command Script Editor (found on the <span class="GUI">Edit</span>
menu). Scripts can be created with these commands to be run in the Command
Script Editor. The same scripts can be loaded into function keys, the ePlayer,
or even loaded into Maestro upon starting.</p>

<p>The <b>Command Input Area</b> (<span class="GUI">View</span> menu) at the
bottom of the Workspace allows you to enter commands using the Maestro command
language. You can scroll through commands for recent operations using the <span
class="GUI">UP ARROW</span> and <span class="GUI">DOWN ARROW</span> keys, and
edit the commands. The commands can also be found in the Command Script Editor
(<span class="GUI">Edit</span> menu). One useful command is <code>cd</code>,
which changes the Maestro current working directory. A complete list of commands
can be found in the <a href="../../maestro_command_reference.pdf"
target="pdfmanuals">Maestro Command Reference Manual</a>.</p>

<p>The <b>Pose Viewer</b> functionality allows quick viewing of H-bonds and
clashes from Glide docking results. Just import your Glide Pose Viewer file into
Maestro. If the <span class="GUI">Pose Viewer</span> panel doesn't open
automatically, right-click and hold on the group row for the poses in the
Project Table and choose <span class="GUI">View Poses</span>. You can then use
<span class="Keys">Ctrl+RIGHT ARROW</span> (<span class="Keys">&#x2318;RIGHT
ARROW</span>) to step through the poses. (<span class="Keys">Ctrl+LEFT
ARROW</span> (<span class="Keys">&#x2318;LEFT ARROW</span>) steps back up the
list).</p>
