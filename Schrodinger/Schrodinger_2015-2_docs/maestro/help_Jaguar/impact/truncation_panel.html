<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
The Truncation panel defines the non-bonded cutoffs settings
for an Impact calculation. </p>

<p>When sufficient care is taken, the use of non-bonded cutoffs to
remove interactions between widely separated pairs of atoms is an important
strategy for reducing the time and memory required to perform calculations
on large systems.  At present only residue-based cutoffs are supported for
calculations set up in Maestro.  This means that all atoms within complete
residues that have any pair of atoms within the cutoff distance will be
included in the non-bonded interaction list.</p>

<h2>Opening the Truncation Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Truncation</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Select the <span class="GUI">Use non-bonded cutoffs</span> option
in the <span class="GUI">Potential</span> tab
of the <span class="GUI">QSite</span>,
<span class="GUI">Impact Energy Minimization</span>,
<span class="GUI">Impact Dynamics</span>, or
<span class="GUI">Impact Hybrid Monte Carlo</span> panel,
then click the adjacent <span class="GUI">Settings</span> button.
</p></li></ul>

<dd>
<p>When truncation is active, all the pairs that fall within the cutoff radius
are stored in a "neighbor list". During a minimization calculation or
dynamics simulation, the geometry of the structure may change so as to
bring some pairs of atoms that were originally outside the cutoff distance
to within the cutoff.  Conversely, some pairs of atoms may move outside the
cutoff distance. For these reasons, the neighbor list needs to be updated
from time to time. The frequency of this update is controlled by this
integer field. By default the neighbor list is updated every 10
minimization or dynamics steps. Increasing this value (updating the
neighbor list <i>less</i> often) will speed up the calculation but may
affect the accuracy of the results. Decreasing this value (updating the
neighbor list <i>more</i> often) will slow down the calculation but may
improve the accuracy.</p>

<dt><span class="GUI">Residue-based cutoff distance</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>This text box specifies the value for the cutoff distance.
Increasing the cutoff distance will slow the calculation and require more
memory, but may yield more accurate results. Decreasing the cutoff will
speed up the calculation, but may reduce the accuracy of the results if
significant non-bonded interactions are omitted. This is especially true
for systems that include formally charged atoms, as such systems can have
large long-range electrostatic interactions.
