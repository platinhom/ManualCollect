<p>There are times when you may want to mark specific project entries for
special attention, or to provide a rough ranking of entries. Maestro provides
two properties for this purpose: the <span class="GUI">Mark</span> property and
the <span class="GUI">Stars</span> property. Both of these properties can be
used like any other property: you can sort entries or select entries by these
properties, for example.</p>
<p>The <span class="GUI">Mark</span> property is a simple Boolean property, on
or off. This property is set for the target entry when you press 
<span class="Keys">X</span>, either in the Workspace or in the 
<span class="GUI">Project Table</span> panel, or by choosing 
<span class="GUI">Edit &rarr; Mark &rarr; Target Entry</span>. 
If the property does not exist, it is created. A check box is displayed in the 
<span class="GUI">Mark</span> column for marked entries.</p>
<p>The <span class="GUI">Mark</span> submenu (<span class="GUI">Edit</span> menu in the main_window, <span class="GUI">Entry</span> menu in the project_table)
also allows you to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mark the selected entries (<span class="GUI">Selected</span>)</li>
<li>Mark the included entries (<span class="GUI">Included</span>)</li>
<li>Mark all entries (<span class="GUI">All</span>)</li>
<li>Clear the mark for all entries (<span class="GUI">None</span>)</li>
<li>Invert the marking of the selected entries, or all entries if there is no selection (<span class="GUI">Invert</span>)</li>
</ul>
<p> 
The target entry is the entry that is included in the Workspace that meets one
of the following conditions: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>It is the only entry included in the Workspace</li>
<li>It is the only entry included in the Workspace that is not fixed</li>
<li>It is the only entry included in the Workspace that is selected</li>
</ul>
<p>The <span class="GUI">Stars</span> property is an integer property with
values from 0 to 3, and is represented by stars in the property column. You can
set or change the number of stars by clicking on one of the stars. Clicking
again on a star (or the rightmost set star) clears the star setting (no stars).
You can also choose the number of stars under 
<span class="GUI">Entry &rarr; Stars</span>, use the 
<span class="GUI">Entry</span> shortcut menu, or use the 0, 1, 2, and 3 keys
to set the number of stars for the selected entries. For a single (target)
entry, you can use the <span class="Keys">*</span> key in 
the Workspace or in the <span class="GUI">Project Table</span> panel to cycle
through the number of stars.</p>
