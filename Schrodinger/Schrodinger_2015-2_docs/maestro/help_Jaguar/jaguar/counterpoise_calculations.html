<p>Counterpoise calculations are a way to correct dissociation energies for the
finite size of the basis set used.</p>
<p>In a molecule, the basis set for an atom is effectively enlarged by the basis
sets on nearby atoms: basis functions on neighboring atoms can fill in the holes
in the basis set. The energy for that atom inside the molecule is lowered
relative to the isolated atom by the presence of neighboring basis sets. The
error due to the mismatch in basis sets between the molecule and the isolated
atom is called <i>basis set superposition error</i> (BSSE). 
</p>
<p>So if we calculate the energy of a hydrogen bond by first calculating the
energy of the complex, then subtracting the energies calculated for the isolated
molecules, we will overestimate the strength of the bond. Counterpoise
calculations correct for this overestimation by using the basis set for the
entire system for the isolated molecule rather than just the basis set
for the isolated molecule itself. Then the molecule benefits from the extra basis
functions both in the complex and in isolation, and the effects of the extra
basis functions cancel to some extent. 
</p>
<p>Counterpoise-corrected dissociation energies require several calculations:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Geometry optimization of the complex (or molecule) whose dissociation
energy you want to calculate in the basis set of the complex.</li>
<li>Geometry optimization of the fragments in the basis sets of the
fragments.</li>
<li>Single-point calculations on the fragments at the geometry of the complex in
the basis sets of the fragments.</li>
<li>Single-point calculations on the fragments at the geometry of the complex in
the basis set of the complex.</li>
</ol>
<p>The difference between the first and the second gives the uncorrected
dissociation energy. It is the last two that provide the counterpoise
correction, which is the difference between the energies from the third and
fourth calculations, and is positive.
</p>

<p>Jaguar provides the <span class="GUI">Counterpoise</span> panel for
calculation of the counterpoise-corrected dissociation energy of non-bonded
complexes. In this panel you can make settings for the basis set, level of
theory, SCF convergence, and geometry optimization. You can run multiple
complexes, and distribute the calculations over multiple processors. The
counterpoise-corrected energy for each complex is calculated and returned.
</p>
<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Counterpoise</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Applications &rarr; Jaguar &rarr; Counterpoise</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Tasks &rarr; Quantum Mechanics &rarr; Counterpoise</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There is also a panel for calculating energies of hydrogen-bonded complexes,
with a specific protocol for the calculations&mdash;see the topic 
<a href="hydrogen_bond.html">Jaguar Hydrogen Bond Energies</a> for details.
</p>
<p>For other types of counterpoise calculations, such as breaking covalent
bonds, you will need to set up the input files for the calculations. Jaguar's
facility for counterpoise calculations is general, so it can be applied in any
situation. To do a calculation on a fragment in the basis of the complex, you
use the input file for the complex. The atoms of the complex that are <i>not</i>
in the fragment must be identified, which is done by placing an @ character
after the atom name in the <b>zmat</b> section, e.g.
</p>
<p>
<code>Na4@   0.00000  0.00000  4.00000</code>
</p>
<p>This makes the atom a &quot;ghost&quot; atom, i.e. one with no nucleus and no
electrons, only a basis set where the atom would otherwise be. Having set up the
input files, you will have to run a job for each, and then calculate the
counterpoise-corrected dissociation energy from the resulting energies. More
information can be found under Counterpoise Calculations in the <i>Jaguar User
Manual</i>.</p>
