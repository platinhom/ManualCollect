<p>You can duplicate the selected entries in the 
<a href="../project_facility/project_table.html"><span class="GUI">Project
Table</span> panel</a> using <span class="GUI">Entry &rarr; Duplicate</span>, or the
corresponding item on the shortcut menu for the entries. There are several
possible locations for the duplicate 
entries, which you can choose from this submenu.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="GUI">In Place</span>&mdash;Each duplicated entry is placed
immediately below its source entry, and is included in the source's entry group
if one exists.
</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Ungrouped</span>&mdash;Each duplicated entry is placed at
the end of the ungrouped entries, in sequential order.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Into New Group</span>&mdash;The duplicated entries are
placed into a new entry group. You can name the group in a dialog box that
opens.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Into Existing Group</span>&mdash;The duplicated entries
are placed into an existing entry group. You can select the group in a dialog
box that opens.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also duplicate an entry group by right-clicking on the group and
choosing <span class="GUI">Duplicate</span>. 
</p>

<p>The duplicated entries retain the same title and entry name as the
originals.</p>

<p>The duplicates are selected in the Project Table in place of the original
entries, and any original entry that is included in the Workspace is replaced in
the Workspace by its duplicate. If modifications have been made in the Workspace
to any of the original entries, synchronization of the Workspace with these
entries is performed according to the synchronization preference (see the <a
href="../maestro_menu/preferences.html#workspace_changes">Workspace -
Changes</a> preferences section of the <a
href="../maestro_menu/preferences.html">Preferences Panel</a> topic). Any
changes that were made to the Workspace that were not synchronized are
transferred to the duplicated entries.
