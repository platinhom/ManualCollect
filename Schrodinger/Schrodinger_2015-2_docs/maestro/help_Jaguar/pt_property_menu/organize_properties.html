<p>In many situations, the Project Table can contain a large number of
properties. Maestro provides a number of tools for organizing these properties,
so that you can show only the ones that are relevant to the current task and
hide the rest, or find particular properties. 
</p>

<p>Properties are classified into groups, or <i>families</i>, according to the
application that generated them. Within each property family, the properties are
classified into <i>primary</i> and <i>secondary</i> properties, each of which is
also considered a family. 
If you want to organize properties into families that suit your own purposes,
you can do so in the <a href="manage_custom_property_families.html"><span
class="GUI">Manage Custom Property Families</span> panel</a>, which allows you
to create, edit, and delete custom families.
</p>

<h3>Showing and Hiding Properties</h3>

<p>You can show or hide properties by using the <span class="GUI">Show</span> button on the 
<span class="GUI">Property</span> toolbar<br style="margin-bottom: 10px;" />
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/pt_show_props.png" />
<br style="margin-bottom: 10px;" />or the items under 
<span class="GUI">Property &rarr; Show</span>. The options available to you are:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="GUI">All</span>&mdash;Show all project properties.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">None</span>&mdash;Hide all project properties. Only the <span class="GUI">Row</span>, <span class="GUI">In</span>, and <span class="GUI">Title</span> columns remain visible.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Primary Only</span>&mdash;Show only the primary properties of each property family, and hide the secondary properties.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">For Selected Entries</span>&mdash;Show only the properties that have values for one or more of the selected entries, and hide all other properties.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Select</span>&mdash;Select the properties to show. Opens the <a href="../pt_property_menu/show_property_db.html"><span class="GUI">Show Properties</span> dialog box</a>, in which you can choose the properties to show.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can show or hide property families with <span class="GUI">Property &rarr; Show Only Family</span> and
<span class="GUI">Property &rarr; Hide Family</span>. These submenus list the
families that are available in the project, including primary and secondary
families.</p>

<p>You can also show and hide properties, and find properties, using the <span
class="GUI">Property Tree</span> panel, which you can open with the 
<span class="GUI">Tree</span> button on the 
<span class="GUI">Property</span> toolbar<br style="margin-bottom: 10px;" />
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/pt_tree.png" />
<br style="margin-bottom: 10px;" />or with <span class="GUI">Property &rarr; Tree</span>. 
This panel is docked to the right of the properties in the table by default.
</p>
<p>The tree is organized by families, with one node for each family, and nodes
underneath it for the primary and secondary properties, with properties sorted
alphabetically under each node. Click on the turner (&plus; or &minus;) to show
or hide the next level.  If you want to expand or collapse all branches of the
tree, right-click on any family (but not on a node) and choose <span
class="GUI">Expand All</span> or <span class="GUI">Collapse All</span>.</p>
<p>The properties that are shown in the tree can be filtered, by entering the
text you want to match in the search text box. This text can include wildcard
characters: * to match any number of characters, ? to match a single character;
and it can include character sets enclosed in square brackets, such as
[a-z]. Filtering is done as you type, and the tree displays only the nodes that
contain properties that match the filter. To show the full tree again, click the
clear (X) button at the right side of the text box.</p>
<p>To show or hide any property or any group of properties (a property family,
or the primary or secondary properties of a family), click the appropriate check
box. If a group of properties has some but not all of its properties shown
(checked), the check mark is gray, to indicate that the group is incompletely
shown.</p>
<p>Since properties can belong to more than one family, when you select a
property or a group of properties to be shown, other groups or properties can be
selected. For example, selecting the secondary family for Glide also selects the
Glide Residue Interactions family, because this family is a subset of Glide
secondary properties.  
</p>
<p>Even after hiding many properties, the property you want to examine might not
be shown in the part of the table that is in view. To bring the property into
view, you can scroll the table horizontally, or you can right-click on a
property in the property tree and choose <span class="GUI">Scroll Into
View</span>.
</p>


<h3>Rearranging Property Columns</h3>

<p>To move a property column, you can </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Drag the column header to the desired location. This works for moving
properties between the fixed area and the scrolling area as well as within these
areas. 
</p></li>
<li><p>Use the <span class="GUI">Move To</span> item on the shortcut menu for
the column. This menu has the following items: 
<span class="GUI"></span>, <span class="GUI"></span>, <span class="GUI"></span>, <span class="GUI"></span>, <span class="GUI"></span>, <span class="GUI"></span>, <span class="GUI"></span>, and <span class="GUI"></span>. 
If a choice of a property is needed to complete the move, a property selector
opens so you can choose the property.
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Property &rarr; Columns &rarr; Reorder</span>
and make the desired changes in the order of the properties in the
<a href="../pt_property_menu/reorder_properties.html"><span class="GUI">Reorder
Properties</span> dialog box</a>. You can also open this dialog box from the
<span class="GUI">Columns</span> button menu on the 
<span class="GUI">Property</span> toolbar.<br style="margin-bottom: 10px;" />
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/pt_columns.png" />
<br style="margin-bottom: 10px;" />
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Columns that are moved to the fixed area are placed after the standard fixed
columns.</p>
