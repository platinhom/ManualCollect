<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>The measurements panel is used to add and remove measurement labels for
distances (defined by two atoms), angles (defined by three atoms), dihedrals
(defined by four atoms), and NMR spin-spin coupling constants for vicinial
hydrogens (defined by two atoms). The measurements can be stored for later
use. </p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Measurements Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Measurements</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Tools &rarr; Measurements</span> &rarr; 
<i>measurement-type</i>.
</p></li></ul>


<p>This panel is dockable, so it opens by default in the Workspace. You can
change this behavior in the <a href="../maestro_menu/preferences.html"><span
class="GUI">Preferences</span> panel</a>, under <span class="GUI">General
&ndash; Panels</span>.
</p>

<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Measurements Panel</h2> 


<p>To display measurements of distances, angles, dihedral angles, and NMR
spin-spin coupling constants, define each entity by picking the appropriate
number of atoms. To add a new measurement, choose an object from the
<span class="GUI">Pick</span> option menu in the <span class="GUI">Define atoms
for</span> <i>parameter</i> <span class="GUI">measurement</span> section, and
select atoms or bonds in the Workspace. If you select the wrong atom, click it
again to deselect it. When the last atom is selected, the measurement is listed
in the table and displayed in the Workspace as a set of lines defining the
measured entity and a label that gives the value. </p>

<p>To delete an existing measurement, select the measurement in the list
and click <span class="GUI">Delete</span>. To delete all
measurements of that type, click <span class="GUI">Delete All</span>.
The measurements are removed from the Workspace and the table. </p>

<p>All the defined measurements are deleted when Maestro
is closed. They are not saved in the structure file unless you choose to
<a href="#feature1.6">create a property</a> for the measurements. </p>

<p>The number of decimals in the measurements, the font for the measurement
markers, and the border around the markers can be set in the 
<a href="../maestro_menu/preferences.html#measurements"><span 
class="GUI">Preferences</span> panel</a>.
</p>

<p>To move a measurement marker, drag it in the Workspace. 
</p>

<h2>Measurements Panel Features</h2> 


<p>The measurements panel has four tabs. 
Each tab has the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#feature1.2"><span class="GUI">Define atoms 
for</span>&nbsp;<i>parameter</i>&nbsp;<span class="GUI">measurement</span>
section</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature1.3">Table</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature1.4"><span class="GUI">Delete</span> and
<span class="GUI">Delete All</span> buttons</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature1.5"><span class="GUI">Write</span> button</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature1.7"><span class="GUI">Preferences</span> button</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature1.6"><span class="GUI">Create property for selected
entries</span> option</a></li> 
</ul>
<p></p>

<dl>

<a name="feature1.2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Define atoms for</span>&nbsp;<i>parameter</i>&nbsp;
<span class="GUI">measurement</span> section</dt>
<dd><p>Each of the tabs (<span class="GUI">Distances</span>,
<span class="GUI">Angles</span>, and <span class="GUI">Dihedrals</span>)
contains a set of <a href="../misc/picking_controls.html">picking controls</a>
that you use to define the measurement. You can select either atoms or bonds.
If you choose atoms, you must select two atoms for a distance or a coupling
constant, three for an angle, or four for a dihedral. If you choose bonds, you
must select one bond for a distance, two for an angle, or three for a
dihedral. When an atom is selected, it is marked with a purple cube.</p>

<p>When selection is complete, the measurement is marked in the Workspace if you
have Markers selected, and the measurement is added to the table.
By default, distances are marked by a dashed purple line,
angles are marked by a solid green line on the bonds and a dashed green line
connecting the two bonds, dihedrals are marked by a solid red line on the bonds
and a dashed red line connecting the 1-2 bond with the 3-4 bond, and coupling
constants are marked by a dashed turquoise line. The measurement that is
selected in the table is drawn with thicker lines than the unselected
measurements.  You can show or hide the markers with the <span
class="GUI">Markers</span> option, and you can change the color of the markers
in the <span class="GUI">Preferences</span> panel, which you can open by
clicking <span class="GUI">Preferences</span>.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature1.3"></a>
<dt>Table</dt>
<dd><p>The table in the center of the panel contains the atoms that define the
measurements and the results of the measurement. Each row in the table displays
information for a single measurement item. Only one row in a table can be
selected at a time. The selected row is the current measurement item that is
highlighted with two parallel solid lines, as described in the chart
above.</p></dd>

<a name="feature1.4"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Delete</span> and <span class="GUI">Delete All</span>
buttons</dt>
<dd><p>Click <span class="GUI">Delete</span> to delete the selected
measurement item. Click <span class="GUI">Delete All</span> to delete all
measurement items in the table. </p></dd>

<a name="feature1.5"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Write</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Opens the <a href="write_measurements_panel.html">
<span class="GUI">Write Measurements</span> panel</a>, in
which you can write all measurement items to a plain text file. The file
contains one measurement per line. Each line contains the atom numbers,
measurement value, and related information, separated by a comma, a tab
character, or a user-defined delimiter.</p></dd>

<a name="feature1.7"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Preferences</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Opens the <span class="GUI">Preferences</span> panel with the <span
class="GUI">Measurements</span> tab displayed, so you can set the display
precision, the text font, the background for the text, and the marker color.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature1.6"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Create property for selected entries</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Select <span class="GUI">Create property for selected
entries</span> to add a property to the Project Table for each subsequent
measurement that you make.  If the measurement property already exists, its
value is updated. You can create a property for multiple entries by selecting
them in the Project Table, and defining the measurement within the included
entry. The included entry must be one of the selected entries.</p>

<p>For distance, angle, dihedral, and coupling constant measurements, the
property name is constructed from the property type and the atom numbers: for
example, Distance 12-24, Angle 32-48-69, Dihedral 12-34-56-78, Coupling 15-21.
In the property name, the sequence of picked atom numbers is always shown with
the smallest number first. Atom names can be used instead of atom numbers in
the property name if you create the property using a Maestro command. For
example, the command <tt>distance </tt><i>atomname1</i> <i>atomname2</i>
generates a property named &quot;Distance
<i>atomname1</i>-<i>atomname2</i>&quot; in the Project Table.</p>

<p>There can be any number of distance, angle, or dihedral properties in the
Project Table. These property values are real numbers. </p>
</dd>
</dl>


<a name="restrictions"></a>
<h2>Restrictions on Measurements</h2>

<p>Measurements are allowed between &quot;background&quot; entries (those that
are included in the Workspace, but not selected in the Project Table) and one
specified entry (one that is both included and selected).
In this way, it is possible to generate properties such as distances
between a series of ligands and a given receptor as a background. </p>

<p>In the processing of a measurement, selected atoms may come from different
entries (picked entries). You must follow some rules when you apply a
measurement as a property to selected entries: </p>
<ul>
<li>A measurement is allowed within a single entry,
but this entry must be both selected and included. </li>
<li>One and only one of the picked entries may be selected. It is an error
if a measurement is made by specifying atoms from more than a single
selected entry. </li>
<li>The scratch entry can be picked. However, if any picked atoms come from the
scratch entry, then all picked atoms should come from that entry.</li>
<li>If none of the picked entries is selected, the measurement is
not applied to selected entries. </li>
</ul>
