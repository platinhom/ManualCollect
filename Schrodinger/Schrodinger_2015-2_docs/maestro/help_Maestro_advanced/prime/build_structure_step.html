<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>In this step, you build a model structure for the query based on the
template chosen in the <span class="GUI">Find Homologs</span> step and aligned
in the <span class="GUI">Edit Alignment</span> step.</p>


<a name="working"></a> 
<h2>Working in the Build Structure Step</h2> 

<p>The process of building a structure from one or more templates involves the
following steps.</p>

<ul>
<li>Copying of backbone atoms for aligned regions and side chains of conserved
residues</li>
<li>Optimization of side chains</li>
<li>Minimization of non-template residues</li>
<li>Building of insertions and closing of deletions in the alignment</li>
</ul>

<p>By default, all of these steps are performed, except that insertions of more
than 20 residues are omitted. Also by default, only the protein structure is
built: ligands, cofactors and waters are deleted before building. However, you
can choose to leave out one or more steps (except the first), and you can choose
to build in ligands and cofactors. (Water molecules must be added afterwards.)
These choices must be made before you build the structure. If you are using
multiple templates, you must also choose the type of model you are building:
composite, consensus, homo-multimer or hetero-multimer. For composite models,
you must select the regions from each template that are used to build the
structure. The following sections provide more detail on the choices to be
made.</p>

<p>For details and technical information about the Build Structure step, see the
<a href="../../../prime/prime_user_manual.pdf"
target="pdfmanuals">Build Structure chapter</a> in the
<a href="../../../prime/prime_user_manual.pdf"
target="pdfmanuals"><i>Prime User Manual</i></a>.</p>

<h4>Building a Composite Model</h4>

<p>If you want to build a composite model from the templates you selected in the
<a href="find_homologs_step.html"><span class="GUI">Find Homologs</span>
step</a>, select <span class="GUI">Composite/Chimera</span> in the <span
class="GUI">Multiple-template modle type</span> section.
You must specify which template should be used for each region of the
query, otherwise, the first template in the table is used for the entire
query.</p>
<p>To specify the regions to be used for each template, first select <span
class="GUI">Set template regions</span> (selected by default), then select the
desired region on each template in the Sequence Viewer. When you begin to select
the template regions, only the first template is in use. As you select regions
in the second template, the corresponding residues in the first template are
automatically deselected. If you select regions for use from a third template,
the corresponding regions of the first and second templates are deselected, and
so on. Thus, the selection process ensures that only one template residue is
assigned to a query residue (the most recent one selected). Regions of a
template that are not used to model the query are colored dark gray (regardless
of color schemes.)

<h4>Building a Consensus Model</h4>

<p>If you want to build a consensus model from the templates, select <span
class="GUI">Consensus</span> in the <span class="GUI">Model type when using
multiple templates</span> section. The model is then built from the consensus
between the templates at each residue position: for example, if two templates
have a loop in the same spatial region but in the third template, the loop
occupies a different region, the model is built from the two that agree. The
alignment is done as part of the model-building job, so there is no need to
align the structures for the templates.
</p>

<h4>Building Multimers</h4>

<p>In addition to building models for a single chain, you can build models for
multimers that are composed of copies of the same chain (homomultimers) or of
different chains (heteromultimers).</p>

<p>To build homomultimers, you must have an alignment for each chain in the
templatea. Often the template is another homomultimer, but it can also be a
heteromultimer. The main requirement is that structures for each template chain
must be in the correct spatial relation to product the multimer. 
</p>

<p>To build heteromultimers, you must first model the individual units of the
multimer (which can be homomultimers) in separate runs, up to this step. The
templates that you choose to build the individual units must be properly aligned
to each other, so that the resulting built structure has the desired
configuration of the units. To build the model, click <span
class="GUI">Hetero-multimers</span>, choose the runs in the <span
class="GUI">Hetero-multimers Modeling</span> dialog box, and click <span
class="GUI">Start</span>.
</p>

<h4>Setting Constraints</h4>

<p>If you know that certain residues must be in close contact in the final
structure, such as cysteines forming a disulfide bond, you can constrain their
positions in the final model by setting proximity constraints on residue
pairs. Proximity constraints can only be applied if at least one of the residues
in the pair is in a loop, as helices and strands can't be adjusted to satisfy
proximity constraints. A disulfide bond is formally constructed between pairs of
CYS residues. To apply these constraints, select <span class="GUI">Pick residue
pairs in query sequence</span>, and pick the pairs of residues that you want to
be in contact in the final model. You can also apply proximity constraints
between a ligand and the query, by picking a residue and a ligand. 
</p>
<p>Proximity constraints are only available with the energy-based model building
method.
</p>


<h4>Including Ligands and Cofactors</h4>

<p>Cofactors and ligands that are present in the template you have chosen (except
water) are listed in the <span class="GUI">Include ligands and cofactors</span>
list. If you want to include any of these cofactors and ligands in the build
process, select them in the list. You can use control-click and shift-click to
select multiple rows. The selected ligands and cofactors are
highlighted in yellow in the Workspace. By default, only the ligands and
cofactors within 5&nbsp;&Aring; of the chain used for the template are included
in the list. To display the full list, select <span class="GUI">Show
All</span>.</p>

<h4>Choosing Options for Building</h4>

<p>If you want to select the steps that are performed in the building process,
you can do so in the <a href="build_structure_options.html"><span
class="GUI">Build Structure - Options</span> dialog box</a>, which you open by
clicking <span class="GUI">Options</span>.</p>

<h4>Results of Model Building</h4>

<p>When the model is built, the structure is automatically incorporated into the
project, and the model is displayed in the Workspace. For composite and multimer
models, the residues are colored according to how the template was used:
</p>
<ul>
<li>blue&mdash;all coordinates were taken from the template</li>
<li>cyan&mdash;the backbone coordinates were taken from the template</li>
<li>red&mdash;the residue was rebuilt.</li>
</ul>
<p>This information is stored in the Homology Status property
(i_psp_Homology_Status), with values of 0, 1, and 2 respectively.
</p>
<p>The coloring of ALA and GLY residues in the model that came from other
residues in the template depends on whether you clicked <span
class="GUI">Preview Model</span> or <span class="GUI">Build Model</span>. These
residues are colored cyan in the preview, which only indicates that they are
different from the template: the coloring is based on the alignment. In the
built model, these residues are colored blue, because they have no side chains
and therefore all the coordinates in the built model were taken from the
template.
</p>
<p>The sequence in the <span class="GUI">Structure Prediction</span> panel
remains as it was before building: it reflects only the state of the sequences
brought into the <span class="GUI">Build Structure</span> step. The Workspace
sequence viewer displays the full sequence of the built model.
