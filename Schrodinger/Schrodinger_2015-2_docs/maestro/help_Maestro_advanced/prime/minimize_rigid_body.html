<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Minimize the energy of part of a protein by treating it as a rigid body and
adjusting its location and orientation. The minimization can include freely
moving atoms and multiple rigid bodies. The rest of the protein is frozen. The
minimization can be run with periodic boundary conditions, in implicit solvent,
and with an implicit membrane.
</p>

<h2>Using the Minimize as Rigid Body Panel</h2> 


<p>Rigid body minimization allows you to treat part of a system as a rigid body
or a set of rigid bodies, with optional freely moving atoms, and freeze the rest
of the system. The panel offers two standard selections of the rigid body, <span
class="GUI">Protein</span> and <span class="GUI">Ligand</span>, and a <span
class="GUI">Custom</span> feature that allows you to choose the rigid body or
bodies. 
</p>
<p>Rigid-body minimization is naturally a lot faster than a full minimization,
so it is useful for obtaining results where the full optimization is too
time-consuming, or to get a good starting position for a fuller refinement. It
is often used in the early stages of X-ray refinement of a protein structure,
for example.  Below are some scenarios where rigid-body minimization might be
useful.
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Move a ligand into position in a receptor site, with the possibility of
treating the side chains of the receptor flexibly.
</p></li>
<li><p>Minimize the orientation of all side chains in a protein simultaneously.
</p></li>
<li><p>Move a hinged protein into the open or closed conformation rigidly.
</p></li>
<li><p>Refine the structure of a dimer resulting from protein-protein docking,
with constraints to keep the protein in place, and flexible residues at the
interface.
</p></li>

</ul>

choose do not have to be connected: if they are not, each connected piece is

Side Chains</span> from the <span class="GUI">Atom Selections</span> button
menu, each side chain is treated as a rigid body.
</p></dd>

<dd><p>Select atoms for free minimization using the standard

minimized without any constraints, along with the rigid body. You might, for
example, want to pick atoms on the boundary between the rigid body and the rest
of the structure for free minimization. The atom selection should not contain
any atoms that are part of the rigid body region: if it does, they are removed
from the freely moving selection.

to an exclamation point. 
</p>
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/job_status.png" />
<p>
Clicking the button shows a small job status window that lists the job name and
status for all active jobs submitted from the current panel (for Jaguar and
MacroModel this means all jobs from any of the application panels). You can
double-click on a row to open the <a href="../misc/monitor_panel.html"><span
class="GUI">Monitor</span> panel</a> and monitor the job, or click the <span
class="GUI">Monitor</span> button to open the <span class="GUI">Monitor</span>
panel and close the job status window. The job status is updated while the
window is open. If a job finishes while the window is open, the job remains
displayed but with the new status.  The rows are colored according to the
status: yellow for submitted, green for launched, running, or finished, red for
incorporated, died, or killed.  Click anywhere outside the window to close it.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Run</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Run the job with the current job settings.

<dd><p>The status bar displays information about the current job settings for the
panel. This includes the job name, task name and task settings (if any), number
of subjobs (if any) and the host name and job incorporation setting. It also
displays a message for a short time when you start a new job.</p>
