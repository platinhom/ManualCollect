<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>This panel provides a way to visualize and analyze the results of a Glide XP
docking run. The panel's main functions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>To display the XP Glide results from a pose viewer file
(<i>jobname</i><tt>_pv.mae</tt>) in a table of XP terms for each ligand.</li>
<li>To provide 3D visualizations for XP terms.
Information for these visualizations is read from the descriptor file
(<i>jobname</i><tt>.xpdes</tt>), which is generated by Glide XP and must be
located in the same directory as the pose viewer file.</li>
<li>To allow selective evaluation of ligands (and groups of ligands) within the table.
This helps you analyze ligands separately during the screening process.</li>
</ul>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the XP Visualizer Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">XP Visualizer</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Applications &rarr; Glide &rarr; XP Visualizer</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
</ul>


<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the XP Visualizer Panel</h2> 


<p>To generate results that can be used with the Glide XP Visualizer, you must
select <span class="GUI">Write XP descriptor information</span> in the
<a href="dock_settings.html#feature2.3"><span
class="GUI">Settings</span> tab</a> of the <span class="GUI">Ligand
Docking</span> panel, and <span class="GUI">Write pose viewer file</span> in the
<a href="dock_output.html#feature1.0">Output tab</a> of the <span
class="GUI">Ligand Docking</span> panel when you run the XP docking job.
</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> To generate XP descriptor information, you must have a license
for this feature.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#using1">Loading the files</a></li>
<li><a href="#using2">Sorting the table</a></li>
<li><a href="#using3">Selecting cells</a></li>
</ul>
<a name="using1"></a>
<h3>Loading the files</h3>
<p>Click <span class="GUI">Open</span> to load a pose-viewer file that includes
XP descriptors. When you load the file, you are prompted to choose an activity
property to display in the table. If you don't want to display an activity
property, click <span class="GUI">Cancel</span>.</p>

<p>Once the files have been loaded, all of the ligands are loaded into the
table, with the name of the ligand in the far left column (light blue
background), along with the XP terms in the rest of the columns (light gray
background).  If the same ligand name is listed twice in the pose viewer file,
then a <code>-</code><i>N</i> is added to the ligand name, where <i>N</i> is an
integer starting with 2 that is incremented for each successive instance of a
ligand name.</p>

<p>To load descriptors generated by an older version of Glide, select <span
class="GUI">.xpdes</span> and click <span class="GUI">Open</span> to load a
descriptor file and its associated pose viewer file. A file selector opens, in
which you can navigate to the desired <code>.xpdes</code> file.
</p>

<a name="using2"></a>
<h3>Sorting the table</h3>
<p>
To sort the rows of the table by the values in a column, click on the column
heading. There are three sort settings: ascending (+), descending(-), and the
original pose viewer order.  These settings can be changed by successively
clicking on the column heading.  One column can be sorted at a time.
</p>

<a name="using3"></a>
<h3>Selecting cells</h3>
<p>
Clicking on cells produces two different functions depending on the cell type:
</p>

<dl>
<a name="using2.1"></a>
<dt>XP Term Cells</dt>
<dd>
<p>Cells that have a gray border around them indicate XP term values for which a
visualization exists.  By clicking on one of these cells, the border is enlarged
(to indicate that the cell is selected) and the visualization is displayed in
the Workspace. Clicking again removes the visualization. These visualizations
are different depending on the XP term and are described <a
href="#vis">below</a>.</p>
</dd>
<a name="using2.2"></a>
<dt>Ligand Name Cells</dt>
<dd>
<p>You can select multiple ligands by clicking in the <span
class="GUI">Name</span> column, using shift-click and control-click.  If <span
class="GUI">Selected ligands</span> is selected, then Maestro shows the selected
ligands and the view changes each time the selection is changed. If you select
more than 100 ligands, a warning is posted, and <span class="GUI">Selected
ligands</span> is turned off.</p>
<p>
Clicking <a href="#feature6"><span class="GUI">Selected Only</span></a> when
there are multiple ligands selected displays only the selected ligands in the
table. The sorting mechanisms now work exclusively on the ligands shown in the
table. The <a href="#feature6">All</a> button is used to show all ligands in
the table.
</p>
</dd>

<p>You can step through ligands with the <span class="Keys">Left Arrow</span>
and <span class="Keys">Right Arrow</span> keys. If a cell is selected, the
arrow keys move up or down the column for that cell, displaying the
visualization if a cell has an associated visualization.
</p>
