<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>The WM/MM Scoring panel allows you to set up and run a job for estimation of
the free energy of binding, using Prime MM-GBSA for the terms involving the
internal energies, Coulomb and van der Waals interactions, ligand desolvation,
and internal strain, and the WaterMap score for the water displacement
terms.
</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the WM/MM Scoring Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">WM/MM Scoring</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Click <span class="GUI">Perform WM/MM Scoring</span> in the 
<span class="GUI">WaterMap - Examine Results</span> panel.</p></li>
</ul>


<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the WM/MM Scoring Panel</h2> 


<p>The panel can be used for scoring a congeneric series of ligands, in which
the ligands do not induce any changes in the protein (side-chain flips, for
example), there are no water-mediated hydrogen bonds, and there are no
significant contributions from protein or ligand strain or conformational
entropies to the relative binding free energy.
</p>

<p>To prepare the system, you should use the full protein preparation work flow
in the Protein Preparation Wizard, including the restrained minimization with
the crystal lead in the active site. For the ligands, members of the congeneric
series should be built by making peripheral additions to the core of this lead.
The series should not change the charge on the ligand. 
</p>

<p>The job performs the Prime MM-GBSA calculation with the options set in the
panel, and constructs the WM/MM score from the MM-GBSA results and the WaterMap
results. You can distribute this job over multiple processors.
</p>

<p>If you want to run this job from the command line with the
<code>prime_mmgbsa</code> command, you should use the <code>-watermap</code>
option to specify the location of the WaterMap results (structure file). 
</p>

<p>After preparing your structures, you can set up the calculation as follows:
</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Specify the source of the structures.
</p>
<p>You can take structures from a Pose Viewer file (Glide output), or from
separated ligand and protein structures. If you choose the latter option, you
must ensure that the ligands and the protein are properly prepared and aligned.
The protein structures must be WaterMap structures, which you can take from a
file or from the Workspace entry.
</p> 
</li>
<li><p>(optional) Choose calculation settings.
</p>
<p>If you want to use ligand partial charges evaluated by some other program,
such as QSite, select <span class="GUI">Use ligand input partial charges</span>.
The input partial charges on the ligand will then be used instead of those
assigned using the default force field.</p> 
</li>
<li><p>(optional) Specify a region within a certain distance of the ligand for
which the protein structure will be relaxed in the calculation. </p>
<p>By default, all protein atoms are frozen, and only the ligand structure is
relaxed. The larger the flexible region, the longer the calculation will
take.
</p></li>
<li><p>(optional) Choose a sampling method for the flexible protein residues.
The default is to minimize them. You can instead choose to minimize just the
side chains, to allow them to move in response to the ligand; or to minimize
just the polar hydrogens, to optimize them for hydrogen bonding. In addition, you can constrain the residues so that they do not move
very much from their input position. 
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Job Settings</span> from the <span
class="GUI">Settings</span> button menu,</p>
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/settings.png" />
<p>set the job parameters in the <span class="GUI">Job Settings</span> dialog
box, then click <span class="GUI">Run</span> in the dialog box to run
the job; or choose <span class="GUI">Write</span> to write the input file and
run the job from the command line.
</p>
<p>When you make settings in the <span class="GUI">Job Settings</span> dialog
box, you can set the number of CPUs and number of subjobs if you are running the
job on a multiprocessor host or submitting it to a queuing system. The ligand
set is divided between the specified number of subjobs.</p> 
</li> 

</ol>

<p>If you want to start over, click <span class="GUI">Reset</span>.

<h3>Structures section</h3>

<p>Specify the source of the ligands and the receptor. The ligands must be
pre-positioned with respect to the receptor, and the receptor must be prepared
as for a Prime refinement calculation. You should remove explicit waters and
ions. If you read structures from a file, you
can use uncompressed (<code>.mae</code>) or compressed
(<code>.maegz</code>, <code>.mae.gz</code>) files.</p>

incorporation of the job into the Maestro project, the job name, the host,
the distribution of subjobs, and any other application-specific job settings.
Opens the <span class="GUI">Job Settings</span> dialog box.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Preferences</span>&mdash;Set general preferences for
running jobs. Opens the <span class="GUI">Preferences</span> panel at the <a

</ul>
</dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Job status</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>This icon indicates when there are jobs running for the application that
belong to the current project. It starts spinning when the first job starts, and
stops when there are no more jobs running. If a job fails to start, it changes
to an exclamation point. 
</p>
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/job_status.png" />
<p>
Clicking the button shows a small job status window that lists the job name and
status for all active jobs submitted from the current panel (for Jaguar and
MacroModel this means all jobs from any of the application panels). You can

class="GUI">Monitor</span> panel</a> and monitor the job, or click the <span
class="GUI">Monitor</span> button to open the <span class="GUI">Monitor</span>
panel and close the job status window. The job status is updated while the
window is open. If a job finishes while the window is open, the job remains
displayed but with the new status.  The rows are colored according to the
status: yellow for submitted, green for launched, running, or finished, red for
incorporated, died, or killed.  Click anywhere outside the window to close it.

</dl>


<a name="status_bar"></a>
<h3>Status bar</h3>
<p>The status bar displays information about the current job settings for the
panel. This includes the job name, task name and task settings (if any), number
of subjobs (if any) and the host name and job incorporation setting. It also
displays a message for a short time when you start a new job.</p>
<p>The status bar also contains the <span class="GUI">Help</span> button, which
opens the help topic for the panel.</p>
