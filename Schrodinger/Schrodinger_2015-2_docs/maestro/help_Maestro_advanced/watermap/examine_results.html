<h2>Using the WaterMap - Examine Results Panel</h2> 


<p>To examine the results of a WaterMap simulation, you can open a WaterMap
output file (<code>_wm.mae</code>, <code>_wm.maegz</code>,
<code>_wm.mae.gz</code>) or archive file (<code>_wm.zip</code> or
<code>_wm.tgz</code>) by clicking <span class="GUI">Import File</span> and
navigating to the file, or you can include a Watermap entry group from the
Project Table in the Workspace. The file is read in as an entry group in the
Maestro Project Table, water site properties are displayed in the panel, and
spheres representing water sites are displayed in the Workspace along with the
receptor/ligand complex. The color scheme used to color the water spheres is
described below. The analysis of the WaterMap entries is performed when you
click the <span class="GUI">W</span> button for the main WaterMap entry in the
Project Table.
</p>


<p>You can do the following tasks:
</p>

<ul>

<li><p>Change what is displayed in the Workspace using the &quot;Display&quot;
options at the top of the panel.
</p></li>

<li><p>Color the sites by their thermodynamic properties or by entry, and label
the sites by their thermodynamic properties or number of hydrogen bonds.
</p></li>

<li><p>Click a row in the table to find the corresponding sphere in the
Workspace. The selected sphere is displayed with a larger radius, and the row is
highlighted.</p></li>

<li><p>Select <span class="GUI">Pick to select site</span>, and pick a
sphere center in the Workspace to highlight the corresponding row in the
table. The sphere is displayed with a larger radius. You can use shift-click to
add to the selection and control-click to select and deselect an individual
site.</p></li>

<li><p>Calculate relative thermodynamic properties (enthalpy, entropy, 
and free energy) for selected ligands in the Maestro Project Table by 
clicking <span class="GUI">Score Ligands</span>.</p></li>

<li><p>Use the controls in the <span class="GUI">Show only water sites
with</span> section to limit the rows that are displayed in the table to 
those that meet the specified criteria.</p></li>

<li><p>Import the trajectory for viewing in the trajectory viewer. 
</p></li>

<li><p>Import the water frames for play with the ePlayer.
</p></li>

<li><p>Change the ligand and reanalyze the Workspace to display information for
a modified ligand, by clicking <span class="GUI">Analyze Workspace</span>.
</p></li>

<li><p>Archive the results of a single WaterMap simulation in a
<code>_wm.zip</code> file. 
</p></li>

<td>Entry ID for the site. Present only when multiple maps are displayed, to
identify the entry for each site. 
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span class="GUI">Occupancy</span>
</td>
<td>&nbsp;
</td>
<td>Average occupancy of the water site by water molecules. The values range from
0 (water molecules are never found in the water site) to 1 (water molecules
occupy the site for the entire time of the simulation).
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span class="GUI">Overlap</span>
</td>

<td><span class="GUI">&Delta;H</span>
</td>
<td>&nbsp;
</td>
<td>Average interaction enthalpy between the water molecule that occupies the
site and the rest of the system relative to bulk water. Sites with positive 
&Delta;H values correspond to waters that are enthalpically less stable in the
protein binding site than in bulk water while negative values correspond to
waters that are enthalpically more stable in the protein binding site than in
bulk water.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span class="GUI">-T&Delta;S</span>
</td>
<td>&nbsp;
</td>
<td>Excess entropy of the water molecules associated with the water site
compared to that of bulk water molecules. Water molecules in the the binding
site of the protein generally have lower entropies than in bulk water and thus
have postive -T&Delta;S values. Larger values correspond to water molecules that
have more significant entropic penalties and thus tend to be less stable in the
binding site.

<dt><span class="GUI">Score Ligands</span> button</dt> 
<dd><p>With this button you can calculate relative thermodynamic properties 
(enthalpy, entropy, and free energy) for the selected ligands in the 
Project Table. You must also have the WaterMap results included in the
Workspace.  The calculated difference in the binding free energy
between two ligands is the difference in the <span class="GUI">WM ligand
deltaG</span> property for the two ligands.</p>

<p>It is important that the ligands be properly positioned in the
binding site and that energetic comparisons be restricted to similar
ligands.  Since WaterMap is designed to identify differences in binding
free energies resulting soley from displacement of water molecules, it is
also important that the differences in the ligand structures do not
result in different interaction energies with the protein.  One highly
recommended approach is to compare ligands that are built from a common
prepositioned scaffold.  For example, if one ligand has a fluorine in
place of a hydrogen in the other ligand, it is recommended that you
duplicate one of the ligands in the Project Table to create a copy of
the ligand and then use the <a href="../tool_bar/main_build_toolbar.html"><span
