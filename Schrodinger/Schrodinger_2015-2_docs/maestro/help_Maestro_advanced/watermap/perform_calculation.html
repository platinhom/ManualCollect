<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>In this panel you can set up and run a WaterMap simulation, which uses
Desmond to run a molecular dynamics simulation of water molecules in the ligand
binding site of a receptor, which is restrained during the simulation. The
excess enthalpy and entropy, and thus the free energy, of the water sites is
estimated. These quantities can be used as a guide to which water molecules
could be advantageously displaced on ligand binding.</p>
<p>WaterMap simulations can include metal atoms that are bonded to the protein
via one or more zero-order bonds. Water molecules that have zero-order bonds to
the metal are retained as chelated solvent during the simulation.

</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If you selected <span class="GUI">Ligand</span>, select <span
class="GUI">Pick</span> and pick a ligand atom in the Workspace. If you want to
include the ligand in the simulation, select <span class="GUI">Retain
ligand</span>.
</p></li>
<li><p>If you selected <span class="GUI">Residues</span>, click <span
class="GUI">Select</span> and select the residues that define the binding site.
</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>(Optional) Enter a distance for the analysis of waters. The distance is
calculated from the ligand or from the selected receptor residues, depending on
the option selected for defining the binding site.
</p></li>
<li><p>If you want to truncate the protein beyond the analyzed waters, select
<span class="GUI">Truncate protein</span>.
</p></li>
<li><p>If you have existing waters, choose an option for treating them from
the <span class="GUI">Treatment of existing waters</span> option menu.
</p></li>
<li><p>Enter the simulation time in the <span class="GUI">Simulation time</span>
text box.</p></li> 
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Job Settings</span> from the <span
class="GUI">Settings</span> button menu,</p>
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/settings.png" />
<p>set the job parameters in the <span class="GUI">Job Settings</span> dialog
box, and click <span class="GUI">Run</span> to run the job.
</p></li> 
</ol>

<p>When the job finishes, the results are incorporated into the project.
</p>

<p>You can also run the WaterMap calculation from the command line.
Once you have set the up the simulation parameters, click <span
class="GUI">Write</span> to write out  the input files needed to run a WaterMap
job from the command line. This button opens a panel that requests a job name.
 After entering the job name, click <span class="GUI">Write</span>.
The following files are written out:</p>
<p>
<i>jobname</i><code>.msj</code> &mdash; the multisim input file.<br />
<i>jobname</i><code>.csb</code> &mdash; the system builder input file.<br />
<i>jobname</i><code>-solute.mae</code> &mdash; the truncated protein.<br />
<i>jobname</i><code>-ligand.mae</code> &mdash; the ligand.<br />
<i>jobname</i><code>-protein.mae</code> &mdash; the whole protein.<br />
</p>
<p>A typical command for running WaterMap might look like:</p>
<pre>
$SCHRODINGER/watermap -JOBNAME protein7c -HOST que_for_parallel_jobs -cpu 8 \
-i protein7c-solute.mae -m protein7c.msj 
</pre>
<p>This command runs a WaterMap job &quot;protein7c&quot; on a queue
&quot;que_for_parallel_jobs&quot; using 8 processors.</p>

<h3>Binding site definition section</h3>

<p>In this section, you define the binding site, either by specifying the ligand
or the receptor residues. the ligand in the Workspace structure and
optionally truncate the protein. The receptor and ligand must be 
displayed in the Workspace. There are two options:</p>

<dl>
<dt><span class="GUI">Ligand</span></dt>
<dd><p>Select this option to define the binding site in terms of the ligand.
You can then select <span class="GUI">Pick</span> and pick a ligand atom in the
Workspace to identify the ligand. The selected ligand molecule is highlighted
with yellow markers. If you pick the wrong molecule, you can pick again to
select the correct molecule. </p>
<p>If you want to include multiple ligands, you can use shift-click to add a
ligand to the selection (and to remove an existing ligand from the selection). 
</p>
<p>If you want to include the ligand in the simulation as well as the protein,
select <span class="GUI">Retain ligand</span>.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Residues</span></dt>
<dd><p>Select this option to define the binding site by selecting
residues. Click <span class="GUI">Select</span> to open the 
<a href="../misc/asd.html"><span class="GUI">Atom Selection</span>
dialog box</a> and select the residues. When you click <span
class="GUI">OK</span>, the ASL expression for the residues is entered in the
text box.
</p></dd>

</dl>

<p>In addition, you can specify the distance from the binding site residues for
which waters will be analyzed, by entering a distance in the <span
class="GUI">Analyze waters within <i>N</i> &Aring; of selected atoms</span> text
box. 
</p>



<a name="feature2"></a>
<h3>Simulation setup section</h3>

<p>In this section you set up the simulation parameters.</p>

<dl>
<span class="GUI">Truncate protein</span> option
<dd><p>Truncate the protein at a distance that includes the region
10&nbsp;&Aring; beyond the waters that you included in the analysis. The effect
is to truncate the protein at a distance of 10+<i>N</i>&nbsp;&Aring; from the
residues used to define the binding site, where <i>N</i> the number entered
above for analyzing the waters. Truncating the protein often has little effect
on the results yet speeds up the calculation. All residues with at least one
heavy atom within the truncation distance from any heavy atom in the ligand are
retained. Broken bonds are reformed and capped with hydrogen atoms. This option
is selected by default.
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Treatment of existing waters</span> option menu</dt>
<dd><p>From this option menu you can decide how to treat water molecules that
are included with the protein structure. Water molecules that have a zero-order
bond to a metal are considered to be part of the receptor, and are retained. The
options are: 
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="GUI">as solvent</span>&mdash;Treat the water molecules as
part of the explicit solvent. These water molecules will be included in the
analysis. 
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">as solute</span>&mdash;Treat the water molecules as
part of the solute. These water molecules will <i>not</i> be included in the
analysis. 
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">delete</span>&mdash;Delete the existing water molecules
before starting the simulation. 
</p></li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Simulation time</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>Enter the desired length of the simulation in ns in this text box.
The simulation time is 2.0&nbsp;ns by default, and should not be set
less than 1.5&nbsp;ns.
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Do not return trajectory upon job completion</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>If this option is selected, the trajectory will not be copied back to the
working directory when the job finishes, but is discarded. The default is to
copy the trajectory.
</p></dd>

</dl>
<a name="job_toolbar"></a>
<h3>Job toolbar</h3>
<p>The Job toolbar is used to make settings for a job and to start it. </p>
