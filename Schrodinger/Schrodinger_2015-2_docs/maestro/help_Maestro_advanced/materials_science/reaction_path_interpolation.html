<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Create a linear synchronous transit reaction path by interpolation between a
reactant structure and a product structure. The path is returned as a set of
structures with a property that defines the distance along the path.

<h2>Using the Reaction Path Interpolation Panel</h2> 


<p>The reaction path interpolation procedure is based on the work of Halgren and
Lipscomb, <i>Chem. Phys. Lett.</i> <b>1977</b>, <i>49</i>, 225.
</p>

<p>In general, the reaction and product structures should be constructed so that
the structures are pre-positioned for reaction (in either direction). It is
highly recommended that you build the product structures by modifying the
reactant structures, breaking bonds and forming new bonds as necessary but
<i>not deleting any atoms</i>. Keeping all the atoms is critical to maintaining
the atom ordering, which is critical for constructing the path. If you build the
products from the reactants, you should do some kind of restrained minimization
of the structures that relieves strain but does not significantly reposition the
product structures.</p>

<p>If you have structures that do not fulfil these conditions, the panel offers
you ways to change the atom numbering and position the reactants and products,
as explained below.</p>

<p>You can select an option to form a complex of the reactants and a
complex of the products, to assist in defining the path. The reactive atoms are
identified and the structures are positioned with respect to each other to form
a pre-reactive or post-reactive complex. This is only available for bimolecular
reactions in which transfer of atoms happens only from one molecule to the other
(not exchange of groups), such as S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions, donation of a group
to another molecule, or reaction of two molecules to form a single molecule (and
its reverse, unimolecular decomposition). Otherwise, you could consider using
the <a href="probe_scan.html"><span class="GUI">Probe Scan</span> panel</a> to
pre-position the reactants and the products.
</p>

<p>You can renumber the atoms if the reactant and product numbering schemes do
not match, in the <span class="GUI">Reorder Atoms</span> panel. This panel shows
a 2D image of the reactant and product complexes, and allows you to visually
select the corresponding atoms for renumbering.
</p>

<p>The points along the reaction path can be chosen as an evenly-spaced set or
as a list of points. The path is defined with a value of 0 for the reactants and
1 for the products. You can add points around the approximate location of the
transition state, spaced at 0.02 in the path coordinate with 5 points on each
side, by selecting <span class="GUI">Add extra points clustered in transition
state region</span>. The presumed transition state location can be chosen as
early (25%), midway (50%) or late (75%) in the reaction path. 
</p>

<p>The simplest linear synchronous transit path can be obtained by interpolating
the Cartesian coordinates of the corresponding atoms in the reactants and the
products. This simple path could involve clashes if the structures were not
properly aligned - for example, if the lines between the corresponding atoms all
passed close to the same point. Distance and internal coordinates are
over-determined sets, so fitting is required. Constraints are imposed so that a
smooth change in the coordinates between the reactant and product structures is
obtained.
</p>

<p>To obtain an initial reaction path for the optimization, the product
structure is superimposed onto the reactant structure before the interpolation
begins, using the nonreactive (or least reactive) atoms to perform the
superposition. The structure obtained at each step of the interpolation is also
superimposed on the reactant structure. This process helps prevent drift
(translation or rotation of the entire structure), and also makes visualization
of the path easier.
</p>

<p>When the path has been generated, the output Maestro file contains all of the
structures: first the reactants, then the reactant complex (if requested), the
steps in the path, the product complex (if requested), then the products. The
step index and distance along the path (in the range 0 to 1) are included as
entry properties, and the reactive atoms are identified with an atom-level
property. To see these properties in the Project Table, you will have to choose
to show them explicitly, or show all properties, as they are not shown by default.

<h3>Structures section</h3>
<p>In this section you define the reactant and product structures, renumbering
the product atoms if necessary.  The structures must have the same elemental
composition.
</p>

<dl>

<a name="feature1.1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Import Reactant from Workspace</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Place the reactant or reactants in the Workspace, positioned
for the reaction, then click this button to identify the contents of the
Workspace as the reactant structure. A 2D sketch of the reactants is displayed
in the reaction diagram. This 2D sketch does not necessarily represent the 3D
geometry or stereochemistry. 
</p></dd>

<a name="feature1.2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Import Product from Workspace</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Place the product or products in the Workspace, positioned
for the reaction, then click this button to identify the contents of the
Workspace as the product structure.  A 2D sketch of the products is displayed
in the reaction diagram.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature1.3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Clear</span> buttons</dt>
<dd><p>Clear the reactant structure or the product structure from the
workflow. The 2D sketch is removed from the reaction diagram. 
</p></dd>

<a name="feature1.4"></a>
<dt>Reaction diagram</dt>
<dd><p>This diagram shows a 2D sketch of the reactant structure and the product
structure. 
</p></dd>

<a name="feature1.5"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Reorder Product Atoms</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>If the reactant and product structures do not have the same atom
numbering, click this button to open the <a href="reorder_atoms.html"><span
class="GUI">Reorder Atoms</span> dialog box</a> and change the numbering of the
product atoms. The atom numbering must match, otherwise the reaction path will
be meaningless.</p>
<p>In the dialog box, the reactants constitute the reference structure and the
products constitute the comparison structure (the one that is reordered).
</p></dd>

</dl>

<a name="feature2"></a>
<h3>Sampling section</h3>
<p>In this section you specify the set of points along the reaction path that
you want to calculate. 
</p>

<dl>

<a name="feature2.1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Presumed transition state is</span> option menu</dt>
<dd><p>Choose the approximate location of the transition state along the path
from this option menu. This location is used when adding points to the path and
when determining the bonding. 
</p></dd>

<a name="feature2.2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Number of uniformly distributed points</span> option and menu</dt>
<dd><p>Select this option if you want a uniform distribution of points along the
reaction path, and specify the number of points. These points do not include the
reactant and product structures, so if you choose 10 points, 12 structures are
returned: the reactant, the product, and the structures for each point.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature2.3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Custom point distribution</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>Specify the distribution of points along the reaction path as a
space-separated list of values in the range between 0.0 and 1.0. The values 0.0
and 1.0 are reserved for the reactants and the products. 
</p></dd>

<a name="feature2.4"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Add extra points clustered in transition state
region</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Add 10 points to the path around the presumed transition state with a
step size of 0.02.These points replace any points specified by the uniform or
custom distribution that lie within the range of the extra points.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature2.5"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Determine bonding based on</span> option menu</dt>
<dd><p>Specify how bonds (connectivity) are assigned in the interpolated
structures.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="GUI">Reactant</span>&mdash;Use the connectivity from the
reactant for all structures</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Product</span>&mdash;Use the connectivity from the
products for all structures.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Transition state</span>&mdash;Change the connectivity from
that of the reactant to that of the product along the reaction path, with the
change occurring in the region of the presumed transition state. In this region,
bonds that are broken or formed are represented as zero-order bonds.</li>
</ul>

</dd>

<a name="feature2.6"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Interpolation direction</span> option menu</dt>
<dd><p>Use this option menu to set the direction in which the interpolation
proceeds: from reactant to product or from product to reactant. For a simple
Cartesian interpolation, the path should be independent of the direction, but
for other interpolations, the path may vary with the direction if step mixing is
used.
</p></dd>

</dl>

<a name="feature3"></a>
<h3>Reaction complex section</h3>
<p>Pre-position the reactant molecules for the reaction, and the product
molecules for the reverse reaction. Structures that are pre-positioned close to
the transition state provide better reaction paths than structures that are at
their equilibrium geometries and far from the transition state.</p>
<p>This feature is limited to unimolecular decompositions that form two
molecules and bimolecular combination reactions that do not involve exchange of
atoms (any leaving group comes from only one of the original molecules) So, for
example, an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction would work as the nucleophile combines with
the substrate and the leaving group comes from the substrate, but a hydrolysis
reaction would not work because the water donates a hydrogen and accepts
another fragment.
</p>

<dl>

<a name="feature3.1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Pre-form reaction complex if possible</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Place the reactant structures into a complex that is pre-positioned for
reaction, and similarly place the product structures into a complex. This is done
with rigid-body movement of the molecules.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature3.2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">VDW radius scale factor</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>When positioning the molecules in the complex, ensure that the
intermolecular distances are no smaller than the sums of the scaled radii of the
molecules involved. A larger scaling factor places the molecules further
apart. The molecular diameter is taken to be the largest atom-atom distance plus
the van der Waals radii of the atoms involved; the molecular radius is half this
value.
</p></dd>

</dl>

<a name="feature4"></a>
<h3>Interpolation optimization section</h3>
<p>Set parameters for the optimization of the structures along the path to bring
them as close as possible to the linear synchronous path while avoiding
unreasonable structures. 
</p>

<dl>

<a name="feature4.1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Coordinate system</span> option menu</dt>
<dd><p>Choose the coordinate system in which the interpolation is done.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="GUI">Internal</span>&mdash;Use the internal coordinates of the
structures (bond distances, bond angles, dihedrals). This is a set of redundant
internal coordinates that includes the union of the coordinate sets for both
products and reactants.  This option can be used to avoid some kinds of atomic
collisions along the path, and works for the greatest number of reactions.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Distance</span>&mdash;Use the set of all interatomic
distances. This option can help avoid over-estimation of bond lengths.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Cartesian</span>&mdash;Use the set of Cartesian atomic
coordinates. This is the fastest option</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<a name="feature4.2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Weights</span> text boxes</dt>
<dd><p>Set weights for the coordinates used in fitting the reaction
path. The weights that are available depend on the coordinate type. Increasing
the value increases the rigidity of the interpolated coordinates (damps
changes). If convergence difficulties are encountered, changing the weights
can help. Increasing or decreasing the Cartesian weight can remedy troublesome
reaction paths more effectively than changing the other weighting terms.
When optimizing on distances, each distance is considered a &quot;bond&quot; for
weighting purposes. 
</p></dd>

<a name="feature4.3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Short bond penalty</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>Apply the specified penalty for bonds that are too short. This value can
be increased if the reaction path has atom-atom collisions. The penalty is
applied in the form of <i>penalty</i>/<i>R</i>, where <i>R</i> is the bond
distance.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature4.4"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Previous step mixing</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>Specify the amount of the optimized Cartesian coordinates from the
previous step to mix into the interpolated guess for the current step to form a
guess for the optimization of the current step. Mixing can help to avoid
collisions and to create continuous reaction paths. 
</p></dd>

<a name="feature4.5"></a>
<dt>Use post-superposition coordinates for mixing</dt>
<dd><p>Use the coordinates from the previous step after superposition on the
reactant structure. If this option is not selected, the optimized coordinates
from the previous step before superposition are used. Only available if the
mixing of the previous step is nonzero.
</p></dd>

</dl>

<a name="job_toolbar"></a>

The file names are based on the current job name, and the files are written to
a subdirectory of the current working directory that is named with the job
name.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Job status</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>This icon indicates when there are jobs running for the application that
belong to the current project. It starts spinning when the first job starts, and
stops when there are no more jobs running. If a job fails to start, it changes
to an exclamation point. 
</p>
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/job_status.png" />
