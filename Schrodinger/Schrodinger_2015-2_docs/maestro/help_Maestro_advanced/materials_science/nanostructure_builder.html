<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Build nanotubes or nanosheets from a specified asymmetric unit, composition,
and geometry to a given size. Multi-walled nanotubes and multi-layer nanosheets
can be constructed as well as single-walled nanotubes and single nanosheets, and
nanotubes with a range of chiral indices can be generated.
</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Nanostructure Builder Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Nanostructure Builder</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Applications &rarr; Materials Science &rarr; Build Nanostructures</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Tasks &rarr; Materials &rarr; Build Nanostructures</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
</ul>


<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Nanostructure Builder Panel</h2> 


<p>The nanostructure builder can produce single- or multi-walled nanotubes, and
single- or multi-layer nanosheets. All structures are based on the usual
honeycomb pattern of connectivity, with three neighbors for each atom. The edges
can be terminated with a single bond to a chosen terminating group, or left with
no terminating group.</p>
<p>A formal assignment of bonding is made between the atoms. On this basis, the
atoms in the nanostructure can be trivalent, so that each atom has three single
bonds (as in BN), or tetravalent, so that each atom has two single bonds and one
double bond (as for carbon). Other than this, no attempt is made to assign bond
orders or formal charges based on valence, and no checking is done on the
validity of this assignment, as nanostructures can be built with this panel out
of any elements.</p>
<p>
If you plan to use the nanostructures in modeling with force fields (such as
molecular dynamics), you will have to choose atoms that are supported by the
force field, and have appropriate sp<sup>2</sup> atom types. If the atoms you
choose are not trivalent or tetravalent, you will have to assign bond orders
and formal charges before using the structure for modeling. You might also have
to assign formal charges for trivalent elements.</p>
<p>For quantum mechanical modeling, connectivity and atom typing is not
relevant. You could, for example, generate PbO nanosheets, and ignore the
bonding. Generating nanostructures is quicker if you choose not to add
double bonds.
</p>

<p>The first step in building nanosheets or nanotubes is to define the basic
building block and choose how to terminate the sheets or tubes. This task is
common to both types of nanostructure.  
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Specify the composition of the unit cell, by entering the
element symbols in the <span class="GUI">Elemental composition</span> text
boxes.  
</p></li>
<li><p>Define the length of the bond between the two atoms in the unit cell, by
entering a value in the <span class="GUI">Bond length</span> text box.
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose an organic fragment to terminate the bonds on the ends of the
tubes or the edges of the sheet, from the <span class="GUI">Fragment</span>
option menu. If the fragment is polyatomic, you can also perform a 
minimization of the fragments when they are attached. 
</p></li>
</ol>

<p>You can switch between nanosheet and nanotube creation with
the <span class="GUI">Create</span> options. The controls below are updated
according to your choice.
</p>

<p><b>Nanosheets:</b></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Choose the edge types for the two edges of the sheet, from <span
class="GUI">armchair</span> and <span class="GUI">zigzag</span>. 
</p></li>
<li><p>Set the dimensions of the sheet in terms of the unit cell size.
</p></li>
<li><p>If you want a multi-sheet structure, choose the number of bilayers, set
the layer separation, shift, and stacking geometry. 
</p></li>
</ol>

<p><b>Nanotubes:</b></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Set the chiral indices (n,m) for the tube (or the innermost tube).
</p></li>
<li><p>Specify the length in terms of the number of repeating units.
</p></li>
<li><p>If you want a multi-walled nanotube, set the number of walls and the wall
separation.
</p></li>
<li><p>If you want to generate nanotubes with a range of chiral indices, select
<span class="GUI">Enumeration</span> and choose an enumeration option. 
</p></li>
</ol>

<p>When you have finished setting options, set the job name and click <span
class="GUI">Run</span> to run the job. The structures are written to a Maestro
structure file, and by default are incorporated into the current Maestro
project. If you want to change any of the job options, click the <span
class="GUI">Settings</span> (gear) button.

<a name="feature1"></a>
<h3>Unit cell section</h3>
<p>Specify the unit cell composition in terms of the two atoms of the asymmetric
unit.
</p>

<a name="feature1.1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Elemental composition</span> text boxes</dt>
<dd><p>Specify the composition for the unit cell. There are no limitations
imposed on the elemental composition, and no imposition of valence rules or
assignment of formal charges in the construction of the nanostructure. All atoms
have bonds to three neighboring atoms within each sheet or tube (including the
terminating groups).</p>
<p>If you intend to use these structures for studies with force fields (such as
MD), you will have to choose atoms that are supported by the force field and
have suitable sp2 atom types. For quantum mechanical studies, issues of bond
order, connectivity, and formal charge are not important.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature1.2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Bond length</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>Specify the length of the bond between the two atoms in the unit cell, in
angstroms.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature1.3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Single bonds only</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>By default, there is a double bond between the atoms of the unit
cell. Select this option to create a structure with single bonds only. For
example, you would want double bonds for carbon nanostructures (tetravalent
atoms), but single bonds for BN nanostructures (trivalent atoms).
</p></dd>



<a name="feature2"></a>
<h3>Termination section</h3>
<p>Specify how the ends of the nanotubes or the edges of the nanosheets are to
be terminated, to satisfy the valence. Single bonds are formed to a fragment. 
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#feature2.1"><span class="GUI">Fragment</span> option menu</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature2.2"><span class="GUI">Minimize terminating fragments</span> option</a></li>
</ul>

<dl>

<a name="feature2.1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Fragment</span> option menu</dt>
<dd><p>Choose the fragment to add to the ends or edges from the list on this
menu. The default is hydrogen. If you do not want fragments added, choose <span
class="GUI">none</span> from the menu.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature2.2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Minimize terminating fragments</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Perform a minimization of the terminating fragments, to relieve any
steric crowding. The atom in the fragment that is attached to the nanostructure
is held fixed, as is the nanostructure itself. The minimization of the fragment
is done with a force field (with backup general atom typing for unrecognized
atom types in the nanostructure).  This option is only available if the
terminating fragment is polyatomic. 
</p></dd>

</dl>

<a name="feature3"></a>
<h3>Create options</h3>
<p>Select an option for the kind of structure to build, from <span
class="GUI">Nanosheets</span> and <span class="GUI">Nanotubes</span>. The
relevant controls for the structure type are displayed below these options when
you change your selection. 
</p>

<a name="feature4"></a>
<h3>Sheet section</h3>
<p>This section is displayed if <span class="GUI">Nanosheets</span> is selected
for the <span class="GUI">Create</span> option.
</p>

<dl>

<a name="feature4.1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Edge types</span> option menus</dt>
<dd><p>Specify the edge type for each of the edges in the nanosheet. The choices
are <span class="GUI">armchair</span> and <span class="GUI">zigzag</span>. 
</p></dd>

<a name="feature4.2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Dimensions</span> text boxes</dt>
<dd><p>Specify the size of the nanosheet in terms of the number of unit cells
(hexagons) along each edge. The actual number of atoms depends on the edge type.
For the zigzag edge, the symmetry operations to add the next unit place some
atoms over atoms in an existing unit, and only the unique atoms are added,
whereas for the armchair edge, all of the added atoms are unique.
</p></dd>

</dl>

<a name="feature5"></a>
<h3>Bilayers section</h3>
<p>This section is displayed if <span class="GUI">Nanosheets</span> is selected
for the <span class="GUI">Create</span> option.
</p>

<dl>

<a name="feature5.1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Number of bilayers</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>Specify the number of bilayers to build. A value of 0 produces a single
nanosheet, whereas a positive integer produces the specified number of bilayers,
and the number of layers is twice this number.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature5.2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Layer separation</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>Specify the layer separation in angstroms. The same separation is used
between all layers (there is no distinction between intra-bilayer and
inter-bilayer separation). 
</p></dd>

<a name="feature5.3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Layer shift</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>Specify the amount by which each layer is shifted relative to the layer
below it. The shift is applied to both directions in the plane of the sheet
(here regarded as the horizontal plane). To produce a vertically aligned stack,
set the shift to zero.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature5.4"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Stack type</span> option menu</dt>
<dd><p>Specify how the layers are stacked.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="GUI">ABAB</span>&mdash;the direction of the shift is reversed
for each layer that is added. The result is that the odd-numbered layers are
vertically aligned, and the even-numbered layers are vertically aligned but
are shifted relative to the odd-numbered layers.
</li> 
<li><span class="GUI">ABCD</span>&mdash;the shift is applied in the same
direction as each layer is added.</li> 
</ul>
</dd>

</dl>

<a name="feature6.1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Chiral index (n)</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>Specify the chiral index n for the nanotube, which must be greater than
zero. If you choose to generate a
set of nanotubes with different chiral indices n, this is the maximum value of
the n chiral index that is used. If you choose to build a multi-walled nanotube,
this is the index for the innermost tube. 
</p></dd>

<a name="feature6.2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Chiral index (m)</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>Specify the chiral index m for the nanotube, which can take values from 0
to n. If you choose to generate a set of nanotubes with different chiral indices
m, this is the maximum value of the m chiral index that is used. If you choose
to generate a set of nanotubes with different chiral indices n, this is the
minimum value of the n chiral index that is used. If you choose to build a
multi-walled nanotube, this is the index for the innermost tube.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature6.3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Number of unit cells</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>Specify the number of unit cells to use when building the (inner)
nanotube. This determines the length of the nanotube. The number is adjusted for
each wall to obtain tubes of approximately the same length as the inner tube.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature6.4"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Number of walls</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>Specify the number of walls of the nanotube. 
</p></dd>

<a name="feature6.5"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Wall separation</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>Specify the separation between the walls in a multi-walled nanotube. This
value is used along with the chiral indices given for the innermost tube (above)
to construct the outer walls to match as closely as possible the chiral angles
of the innermost tube. Given the geometric constraints on the tube, the wall
separation may not be reproduced exactly. 
</p></dd>

</dl>

<a name="feature7"></a>
<h3>Enumeration options</h3>
<p>Generate all possible nanotubes with a range of m or n chiral index values. 
This section is displayed if <span class="GUI">Nanotubes</span> is selected
