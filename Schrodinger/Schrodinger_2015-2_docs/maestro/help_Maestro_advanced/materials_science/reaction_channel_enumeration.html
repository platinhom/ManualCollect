<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>For a given set of reactants, enumerate possible reaction channels for
several kinds of reactions, either by choosing specific channels, by random
selection, or by exhaustive enumeration.
</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Reaction Channel Enumeration Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Reaction Channel Enumeration</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Applications &rarr; Materials Science &rarr; Reaction Channel Enumeration</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Tasks &rarr; Materials &rarr; Reaction Channel Enumeration</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
</ul>


<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Reaction Channel Enumeration Panel</h2> 


<p>This panel can be used to enumerate the products for various reaction
channels, given a set of reactants. The reactant and product structures can
then be used as input for reaction path interpolation or a transition state
search. 
</p>

<p>The structures are written to a file, with all the reactant molecules in the
first entry, followed by entries containing the products. The products for each
channel are placed consecutively in the file. If you chose to create one entry per
product, the product molecules for a given product set for a given channel are
placed consecutively in the file. The file is incorporated into the project by
default. 
</p>

<p>You can enumerate reaction channels for multiple molecules by including them
all in the Workspace, then setting up the enumerations. As each reaction
involves only one or two reactants, the other molecules are spectators, and are
included in the output reactant and product structures. Before using these
structures for other calculations, you should remove the spectators.
</p>

<p>To set up an enumeration for a random selection of channels:
</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Display the reactant molecules in the Workspace.
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose whether to allow bonds to hydrogen to be considered in the
reaction channels, by selecting or deselecting <span class="GUI">Allow reactive
R-H bonds</span>.
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose whether to keep only the nonredundant channels by selecting or
deselecting <span class="GUI">Unique products only</span>.
</p></li>
<li><p>Select <span class="GUI">Random channels</span>.
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose the channel types that you want to consider in the random
selection, under <span class="GUI">Random channel types</span>. 
</p></li>
<li><p>For <span class="GUI">Number of channels to generate</span>, select
<span class="GUI">Only</span> and set the number of channels you want to generate.
</p></li>
<li><p>(Optional) Specify the seed to be used in the random selection. 
</p></li>
<li><p>If you want to minimize the structures with the OPLS_2005 force field,
select <span class="GUI">Clean up geometries</span>. 
</p></li>
<li><p>If you want to place each product molecule into a separate project entry,
select <span class="GUI">Create one entry per product</span>. 
</p></li>
<li><p>Click <span class="GUI">Run</span> to run the job.
</p></li>
</ol>
<p>To set up an enumeration of all possible channels:
</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Display the reactant molecules in the Workspace.
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose whether to allow bonds to hydrogen to be considered in the
reaction channels, by selecting or deselecting <span class="GUI">Allow reactive
R-H bonds</span>.
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose whether to keep only the nonredundant channels by selecting or
deselecting <span class="GUI">Unique products only</span>.
</p></li>
<li><p>Select <span class="GUI">Random channels</span>.
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose the channel types that you want to consider in the exhaustive
enumeration, under <span class="GUI">Random channel types</span>.
</p></li>
<li><p>For <span class="GUI">Number of channels to generate</span>, select
<span class="GUI">All</span>.
</p></li>
<li><p>If you want to minimize the structures with the OPLS_2005 force field,
select <span class="GUI">Clean up geometries</span>. 
</p></li>
<li><p>If you want to place each product molecule into a separate project entry,
select <span class="GUI">Create one entry per product</span>. By default all
product molecules for a given channel are in the same entry.
</p></li>
<li><p>Click <span class="GUI">Run</span> to run the job.
</p></li>
</ol>

<p>To set up an enumeration for specific channels:
</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Display the reactant molecules in the Workspace.
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose whether to allow bonds to hydrogen to be considered in the
reaction channels, by selecting or deselecting <span class="GUI">Allow reactive
R-H bonds</span>.
</p></li>
<li><p>Specify the first reaction channel by choosing a channel type and picking
atoms in the Workspace. See below for instructions for each channel type.
</p></li>
<li><p>To add another channel, click <span class="GUI">Add Channel</span>, then
choose the channel type and pick atoms. 
</p></li>
<li><p>If you want to minimize the structures with the OPLS_2005 force field,

moves to the next empty cell in the same row once you have picked an atom, so
you don't need to click in each cell to pick atoms sequentially.<br/>
