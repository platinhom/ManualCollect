<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Monitor the progress of a genetic optimization of optoelectronic properties
while a job is running, or examine a completed job.</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Optoelectronics Genetic Optimization Viewer Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Optoelectronics Genetic Optimization Viewer</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Applications &rarr; Materials Science &rarr; Optoelectronics &rarr; Genetic Optimization Monitor</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Tasks &rarr; Quantum Mechanics &rarr; Optoelectronics &rarr; Genetic Optimization Monitor</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
</ul>


<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Optoelectronics Genetic Optimization Viewer Panel</h2> 


<p>This panel allows you to view the results of a completed genetic optimization
job, or to view the progress of a running job. As the jobs can take a long time,
it may be useful to examine the results as it is running, for example to assess
the progress or success of the optimization, or to make use of structures that
meet some criteria before the job finishes.</p>
<p>The panel offers several ways of assessing the progress of the optimization.
</p>
 <ul>
<li><p>In the <span class="GUI">Min/Max Plot</span> tab, you can display the
minimum value and the maximum value of any property as a function of the
generation. For the scores, if the maximum is not increasing, then the
optimization is not making progress. If the maximum is not increasing much and
the spread between the maximum and the minimum is increasing, the process is
generating structures whose properties are less desirable. You then might want
to adjust the parameters to increase the generation of improved structures, or
you might want to consider what kinds of mutations you are performing.
</p></li>
<li><p>In the <span class="GUI">Histogram</span> tab, you can view how many
structures had a particular range of values, color coded by generation. From
this view you can assess whether the number of structures in the desirable
ranges is increasing with each generation.  
</p></li>
<li><p>In the <span class="GUI">Evolution</span> tab, you can view the family
tree of any particular individual in any generation. The tree is marked with
green lines to the parents and blue lines to the children, and the individuals
are colored by a property value. This allows you to see how the property value
is changing between generations. The properties of the family (parents,
individual, children) are shown in the <span class="GUI">Structure Window</span>
so you can examine all the properties, not just the one used for coloring.
</p></li>

</ul>

<a name="feature1"></a>
<h3>Job loading buttons</h3>
<p>These buttons can be used to load the current results for a job or to refresh
the results for an already loaded job.</p>
<p>When you click <span class="GUI">Load New Job</span> a panel opens so you can
select the job. You can either select <span class="GUI">Load from job
database</span>, then select a job from the table of jobs, or you can select
<span class="GUI">Manually locate GA directory</span> and
click <span class="GUI">Browse</span> to open a directory selector and navigate
to a directory that contains the job results. This allows you to examine a job
for which the job record no longer exists in the job database. 
</p>
<p>Clicking <span class="GUI">Refresh Current Job</span> updates the results for
the job that is loaded. This action is only effective if the job is still
running.
</p>

<a name="feature2"></a>
<h3>Show structure window</h3>
<p>Select this option to show the <span class="GUI">Structure Window</span>,
which displays 2D structures together with scores and property values, arranged
in a grid. You can set the number of columns in the grid, and display the
structures from each generation in a separate row. You can select multiple
structures, and either incorporate them into the project or remove them from the
structure window. Structures are not incorporated again if they have already
been incorporated. 
</p>

<a name="feature3"></a>
<h3>Summary tab</h3>
<p>This tab provides a summary of the job, including settings and output.
</p>

<dl>
<a name="feature3.1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Properties</span> section</dt>
<dd><p>This section lists the properties chosen for optimization and the
criteria for optimizing the properties (the values in the 
<a href="optoelectronics_ga_optimization.html#feature3.1">Property table</a> of
the <span class="GUI">Genetic Algorithm</span> panel).
</p></dd>
<a name="feature3.2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Parameters</span> section</dt>
<dd><p>This section lists the parameters set for the genetic algorithm in the
<a href="optoelectronics_ga_optimization.html"><span class="GUI">Genetic
Algorithm</span> panel</a>.
</p></dd>
<a name="feature3.3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Log file</span> section</dt>
<dd><p>This section lists the contents of the log file for the job. 
</p></dd>
</dl>

<a name="feature4"></a>
<h3>Min/Max Plot tab</h3>
<p>In this tab, statistics of a property are plotted against the generation
number.
</p>

<dl>
<a name="feature4.1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Property</span> option menu</dt>
<dd><p>Choose the property to display in the plot area from this option menu.
</p></dd>
<a name="feature4.2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Statistics</span> options</dt>
<dd><p>Select the statistics to plot. You can plot the minimum value observed
for each generation, the maximum value, the average value, the standard
deviation, and the target value, if a target is defined. If you select both the
minimum and the maximum, the area between the lines is colored light green, to
highlight the range of values observed. 
</p></dd>
<a name="feature4.3"></a>
<dt>Plot toolbar</dt>
<dd><p>The toolbar has tools for manipulating the plot and for saving images. 
The buttons are common to all plot toolbars, and are described in the
<a href="../misc/plot_toolbar.html">Plot Toolbar</a> topic.
</p></dd>
<a name="feature4.4"></a>
<dt>Plot area</dt>
<dd><p>The statistics for the property are displayed in this area. Pausing the
pointer over a point displays the 2D structure and property values for that
structure; the points (circles) are only plotted for the minimum and maximum.
Clicking (or right-clicking) on a point displays a menu that allows you to add
the structure to the <span class="GUI">Structure Window</span>, incorporate the
structure into the project, or incorporate all structures into the project.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<a name="feature5"></a>
<h3>Histogram tab</h3>
<p>Dispay a histogram showing the number of structures found as a function of
the chosen property value. 
</p>

<dl>
<a name="feature5.1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Property</span> option menu</dt>
<dd><p>Choose the property for the histogram display from this option menu.
</p></dd>
<a name="feature5.2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Number of bins</span> slider</dt>
<dd><p>Specify the number of bins for the property value to use for the
histogram. The property range is divided equally between the bins.
</p></dd>
<a name="feature5.3"></a>
<dt>Plot toolbar</dt>
<dd><p>The toolbar has tools for manipulating the plot and for saving images. 
The buttons are common to all plot toolbars, and are described in the
<a href="../misc/plot_toolbar.html">Plot Toolbar</a> topic.
</p></dd>
<a name="feature5.4"></a>
<dt>Plot area</dt>
<dd><p>This area displays the histogram. Each bar in the histogram is
partitioned into regions by generation and color-coded according to the legend
on the left. Pausing the pointer over a region shows information on the
properties for the generation represented in that region of the bar. If there
are fewer than 4 structures represented, information on all properties for each
structure is shown, including the 2D structure. If there are 4 or more
structures represented, the ranges of all properties are shown.</p>
<p>If you click on a region, a menu is shown, which allows you to show the
structures from that generation and bin (the region) or the structures from the
entire bin (the bar); and to incorporate structures into the project from the
generation and bin, the entire bin, or the entire set of structures.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<a name="feature6"></a>
<h3>Evolution tab</h3>
<p>Show the evolutionary history of the structures, with color coding of the
structures according to the chosen property value. This allows you to see how
the mutations affected the property value. 
</p>

<dl>
<a name="feature6.1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Property</span> option menu</dt>
<dd><p>Choose a property for color coding from this option menu.
</p></dd>
<a name="feature6.2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Resize with panel</span> option</dt>

<dt><span class="GUI">Color map</span> option menu</dt>
<dd><p>Choose the color map for color coding the property values for each
structure. 
</p></dd>
<a name="feature6.4"></a>
<dt>Display area</dt>
<dd><p>Each generation is shown as a horizontal bar, partitioned into rectangles
for each individual. The rectangles are color coded by the property value. The
tooltip for a rectangle shows the 2D structure and all of the properties.</p>
<p>Clicking a rectangle displays a green line connecting the individual to the
parent (for mutation) or parents (for crossover), and a blue line connecting
the individual to its children. It also adds all of these structures to the
<span class="GUI">Structure Window</span>. Shift-clicking on any of the parent
or children rectangles extends the family tree to the previous or next
generation from that individual.</p>
<p>Right-clicking in a rectangle displays a menu, which you can use to show the
structure in the <span class="GUI">Structure Window</span>, incorporate the
structure, the generation, or all structures into the project, or clear the
family tree display.
