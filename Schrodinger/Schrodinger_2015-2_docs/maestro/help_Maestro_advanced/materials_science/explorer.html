<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>This panel uses a self-organizing map to cluster structures by sets of properties,
and allows you to explore the properties of the structures based on this clustering. 
</p>
<p>A Canvas license is required (to create the self-organizing map).
</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Materials Explorer Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Materials Explorer</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Scripts &rarr; Cheminformatics &rarr; Materials Explorer</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
</ul>


<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Materials Explorer Panel</h2> 


<p>
The project entries are clustered with self-organizing maps, using some
set of descriptors, such as Glide properties, fingerprints, or other molecular
properties.  These clusters define groups of molecules that are similar based on
the descriptors used. The number of clusters is determined by the size chosen
for the map.  A 3x3 map, for instance divides the entries into 9 clusters
arranged in a 3 by 3 square matrix. You can calculate maps for the same set of
descriptors with different sizes.</p>

<p>
Once you have calculated a map, any property can be &quot;projected&quot; onto
the map. To do this, you pick a property, such as the Glide Docking score, and
a statistic of this property, such as the mean, maximum, or minimum. This
statistic is calculated for the chosen property for each cluster in the
map.  These values are then displayed as a color mapping on the map.  You can
then explore the clusters and the property, such as which entries are in each
cell, what the property values are for each cell, what the distance between
cells is, and which descriptors are most important to separating the clusters.
</p>

<p>Each cell in a property map represents a set of molecules that were grouped
together in the self-organizing map.  Neighboring cells are closer to each other
in property space. Gray cells with an orange X are empty. The color of the
cell indicates the value of the property that was mapped onto that cell. 
</p>

<p>Clicking on a cell in a property map highlights that cell and shows where
the members of the cell are distributed in all the maps. By default, the
size of the red circle indicates the percentage of the cell's members that 
are in the highlighted cell.  The indicator of percentage can be changed using
the <span class="GUI">Membership indicators</span> option menu.  A tooltip on 
the menu describes how each type of membership indicator behaves.
</p>

<p>You can select multiple cells, using control-click. When you have multiple
cells selected, the markers can represent the combined set of structures (union,
logical OR), the common set of structures (intersection, logical AND), or the structures
that are different (only in the first cell selected). You can choose which is
represented from the <span class="GUI">Multiple cell highlight mode</span>
option menu.
</p>

<p>When you select cells, you can apply various actions to the structures in the
selected cells: select them in the Project Table, include them in the Workspace,
or mark them as viewed. You can also separately mark individual structures.
