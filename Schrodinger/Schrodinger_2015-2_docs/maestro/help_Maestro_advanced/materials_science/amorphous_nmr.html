<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Calculate NMR shieldings for molecules in an amorphous structure, taking into
account the immediate environment of each molecule. </p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Amorphous NMR Calculations Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Amorphous NMR Calculations</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Applications &rarr; Materials Science &rarr; Amorphous NMR</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Tasks &rarr; Quantum Mechanics &rarr; Amorphous NMR</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
</ul>


<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Amorphous NMR Calculations Panel</h2> 


<p>The NMR shieldings for an amorphous structure are calculated using Jaguar.
For each molecule, the structure is trimmed down to the active molecule, and its
neighbors, which are defined by a distance cutoff (set in the 
<span class="GUI">Nearest neighbor distance</span> text box). This group of
molecules is referred to as a &quot;cluster&quot;. Periodic boundary
conditions are used on the input structure to generate structures in the
adjacent unit cell if the neighbors of any active molecule span the cell
boundaries.</p>
<p>The input must be a structure for a pure substance (not a mixture of
different molecules) that has been prepared for Desmond molecular
dynamics simulations, using the Desmond <a href="../desmond/system_builder.html">System Builder</a> or the <a href="disordered_system_builder.html">Disordered System Builder</a>.
If importing the input from a file, the file must have a <code>.cms</code>
extension.
</p>
<p> By default, a smaller basis set is used for the neighbors than for the
active molecule, as they mainly constitute a perturbation to the electronic
environment of the target. You can change the basis sets for the active molecule
and the spectators (neighbors) and also choose the DFT method for the
calculations. You can also optimize the bonds to hyrogen atoms or all bonds, or
not do any optimization. Only the active molecule is optimized, the spectators
are fixed at their input geometries. 
</p>
<p>You can run calculations on all molecules, a random selection of molecules,
or a selection of molecules, by selecting one of the <span class="GUI">Molecule
subset</span> choices. If you want to select individual molecules, you can do so
by listing the molecule numbers in the <span class="GUI">Molecules</span> text
box. Two ways you can identify the molecule number in the Workspace are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Pause the pointer over an atom. The molecule number is displayed in the
status bar of the Workspace (atom number first, then molecule number).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Label the molecules with the molecule number, by choosing
<span class="GUI">Molecule number</span> from the 
<span class="GUI">Label All</span> button menu on the 
<span class="GUI">Labels</span> toolbar.<br style="margin-bottom: 10px;" />
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/labelatoms.png" />
<br style="margin-bottom: 10px;" /></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As the calculations can take some time, it is recommended that you distribute
them over multiple processors, by setting the <span class="GUI">Processors per
cluster</span> value to use parallel processing within a single subjob, and use
the <span class="GUI"> Limit number of simultaneous clusters</span> option and
text box to restrict the number of simultaneous subjobs. The product of these
two numbers should be the total number of processors used. 
</p>

<p>The shieldings are written to a text file, <i>jobname</i><code>.txt</code>.
This file has six tab-separated columns: the atom label (element and atom
number), the output file, the shielding, and the three diagonal elements of the
shielding tensor. The atoms are sorted by label, so that all the results for a
given atom in different instances of each molecule are listed together for
comparison. The output file naming convention is
Cluster_<code></code><i>molecule-number</i><code>.out</code>.
</p>
<p>The structures for each cluster are incorporated into the project as an entry
group, with the original cell containing all the molecules as the first entry in
the group. The cluster entries are named with the same convention as the output
file.  By fixing the first entry in the Workspace, then including different
clusters, you can identify the location of each active molecule in the amorphous
structure, and correlate the environment of the active molecule with its
shieldings.

<dd><p>Select this option to limit the number of subjobs (each on a single

<p>
Clicking the button shows a small job status window that lists the job name and
status for all active jobs submitted from the current panel (for Jaguar and
MacroModel this means all jobs from any of the application panels). You can

panel and close the job status window. The job status is updated while the
window is open. If a job finishes while the window is open, the job remains
displayed but with the new status.  The rows are colored according to the
status: yellow for submitted, green for launched, running, or finished, red for
incorporated, died, or killed.  Click anywhere outside the window to close it.
