<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Clean up the structure of one or more complexes by performing a force-field
minimization. The metal is treated generically, with the current positions as
the equilibrium geometry. 
</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Complex Cleanup Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Complex Cleanup</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Applications &rarr; Materials Science &rarr; Build Organometallic Complexes &rarr; Clean Up Complexes</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Tasks &rarr; Materials &rarr; Build Organometallic Complexes &rarr; Clean Up Complexes</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
</ul>


<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Complex Cleanup Panel</h2> 


<p>This panel is useful for cleaning up the geometries of complexes after
building, for example in the <a href="build_single_complex.html"><span
class="GUI">Build Single Complex</span> panel</a> or the 
<a href="build_multiple_complexes.html"><span class="GUI">Build Multiple 
Complexes</span> panel</a>.</p>
<p>The atoms that are coordinated to the metal can be specified in several
ways. You can include or exclude hydrogens, keep existing bonds to the metal,
and specify a shell of coordinated atoms by distance or by number of closest
atoms. Atoms with existing bonds are added to the coordinated set specified by
other means if they are not already in the coordinated set. 
</p>
<p>The metal atom is treated as though the metal-ligand bonds are at their
equilibrium distances, with a generic force field whose minimum is at the
current distance, and likewise with the bending parameters. The geometry around
the metal is therefore not likely to change much, so the minimization will
largely affect the ligand geometries. </p>
<p>The minimization is performed with the OPLS_2005 force field, to a
convergence of 0.05 kcal&nbsp;mol<sup>-1</sup>&nbsp;&Aring;<sup>-1</sup>.
Bonds to the metal from the coordinating atoms are replaced with single bonds or
dative bonds (which appear as zero-order bonds in the Workspace).
</p>
<p>Structures from the Workspace or the Project Table are replaced by the
cleaned-up structures. If you choose to clean up structures from a file, the
minimized structures are written to a file named
<i>filestem</i><code>-minimized.maegz</code>.
</p>
<p>It is recommended to perform a QM (Jaguar) optimization on the complexes
after they have been cleaned up. The cleanup should provide a much better
starting geometry for the optimization than the raw structure. Choose 
<span class="GUI">Applications &rarr; Jaguar &rarr; Optimization</span> to set up the
geometry optimization and run the job.

<p>Choose the source of the structures for the current task.

<ul>
<li><span class="GUI">Project Table (selected entries)</span>&mdash;Use the
entries that are currently selected in the Project Table.

The Workspace should not contain a scratch entry.

<li><span class="GUI">File</span>&mdash;Use the structures from the specified
file. When this option is selected, the <span class="GUI">File name</span> text 
box and <span class="GUI">Browse</span> button are activated.  Click
<span class="GUI">Browse</span> and navigate to the file you want to
use. The file name is displayed in the text box when you click <span

You can also enter the file name in the text box.

<dd><p>If you chose <span class="GUI">File</span> from the <span class="GUI">Use

The name of the file you selected is displayed in the text box.

<a name="feature3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Atoms within <i>d</i> &Aring; of the metal atom are considered
coordinated</span> option and text box</dt>
<dd><p>Use this option to specify ligand atoms that are coordinated to the metal
by their distance from the metal. Specify the distance cutoff for detecting
atoms that are coordinated to the metal in the text box.
If <span class="GUI">Preserve existing metal connections</span> is selected,
there may be coordinated atoms that lie outside this distance, as the union of
the two sets (those inside the distance and those with existing bonds) is taken.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature5"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">The <i>N</i> closest atoms are considered coordinated</span> option and text box</dt>
<dd><p>Use this option to specify ligand atoms that are coordinated to the metal
by order of their proximity to the metal. Specify the number of atoms to be
coordinated in the text box. If <span class="GUI">Preserve existing metal
connections</span> is selected, the final number of coordinated atoms may be
greater than the number you specify in the text box, as the union of the two
sets (the closest <i>N</i> and those with existing bonds) is taken.

<dt><span class="GUI">Hydrogen atoms can be considered for coordination</span> option</dt> 
<dd><p>Consider hydrogen atoms to be bonded to the metal if they are within
bonding distance of the metal. 
</p></dd>

<a name="connections"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Preserve existing metal connections</span> option</dt> 
<dd><p>Keep existing bonds to the metal, regardless of whether they satisfy the
criteria for coordination. These atoms are considered coordination in addition
to the ones specified by number or distance. The final number of coordinated
atoms depends on how many atoms with existing bonds to the metal also satisfy
the other criteria.  The bond type of the existing bonds might change from
single to dative to satisfy the valence requirements on the coordinating atom.

<dd><p>Clean up the complexes. The cleanup job is run locally. A progress bar is
displayed to the right if the cleanup takes longer than a few seconds.
