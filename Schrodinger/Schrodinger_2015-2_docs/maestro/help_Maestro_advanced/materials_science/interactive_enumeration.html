<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Set up and enumerate a combinatorial library. The panel provides the means to
define the attachment points on the core-containing structure and to set up the
libraries for each attachment point. You can select structures from a predefined
fragment library or create a new fragment library from a set of 3D structures.
</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Interactive Enumeration Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Interactive Enumeration</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Applications &rarr; Materials Science &rarr; Interactive Enumeration</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Tasks &rarr; Materials &rarr; Interactive Enumeration</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This panel is also opened from the 
<a href="reaction_energetics_enumeration.html"><span class="GUI">Reaction
Energetics Enumeration</span> panel</a> when you click <span
class="GUI">Enumerate Reactant</span>.
</p>

<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Interactive Enumeration Panel</h2> 


<p>This panel is useful for creating a set of ligand structures that are based
on a common core, which is coordinated to the metal. You can vary the functional
groups that are attached to the core to change the properties of the
ligand.

<dt><span class="GUI">Import from</span> option menu and action button
<span class="GUI">Browse</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Import a core-containing molecule that is used to define the
combinatorial library, from one of the sources on the option menu. The sources
available depend on whether you opened this panel outside Maestro or within
Maestro. The action button depends on the choice made from the option menu. The
choices are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Maestro file</span>&mdash;Import the core-containing
molecule from a Maestro file. Click <span class="GUI">Browse</span> to navigate
to the file and select it. The first structure in the file is imported.
</p></li>

<li><p><span class="GUI">Combinatorial definition</span>&mdash;Import a 
combinatorial library definition from file, including all the attachments. Click
<span class="GUI">Browse</span> to navigate to and select a combinatorial
library  definition (<code>-comdef.tar.gz</code>) file. In addition to using the
current panel, a library definition can be generated in the 
<a href="../combiglide/define_combinations.html"><span class="GUI">Define
Combinations</span> step</a> of the <span class="GUI">Combinatorial
Screening</span> panel or in the 
<a href="../combiglide/library_enumeration.html"><span

</li>

<li><p><span class="GUI">Sketcher</span>&mdash;Sketch the core-containing
molecule using the 2D Sketcher. Click <span class="GUI">Sketch</span> to open
the <a href="../edit_menu/2d_sketcher.html"><span class="GUI">2D Sketcher</span>
panel</a>. When you close this panel, the structure is converted to 3D with
LigPrep and imported. 
</p></li>

<li><p><span class="GUI">Workspace</span>&mdash;Import the core-containing
molecule from the Workspace. The Workspace must contain only the core-containing
molecule as a single entry. Click <span class="GUI">Import</span> to import the
molecule.
</p></li>

<li><p><span class="GUI">Project Table</span>&mdash;Import the core-containing
molecule from the Project Table. The project entry for the core-containing
molecule must be the only entry selected. Click <span class="GUI">Import</span>
to import the  molecule.
</p></li>

</ul>

</p></dd>

<a name="feature1.3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Export Core</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Export the core-containing molecule, with its core positions (attachment
points) defined. You can export the molecule to a file, to the Workspace as a
scratch entry, or to the Project Table as a named entry. A menu is displayed so
you can choose the location for the molecule. If you choose to export to a file,
a file selector opens so that you can navigate to a location and name the
file.</p>
<p>If you opened this panel outside Maestro, the choices are not available and
the file selector opens directly.

<dd><p>Displays the 2D structure of the core-containing molecule, with the
attachment points marked by colored arrows. The arrows are color-coded and match
the rows in the <span class="GUI">Combinatorial definition table</span>. The
head of the arrow indicates the fragment or atom that will be removed when an R
group is attached in this position.</p>
<p>You can select bonds in the structure to create attachment points (core
positions). If you right-click on an existing core position, the shortcut menu
allows you to switch the direction of the arrow or delete the core position.
</p>
<p>To associate a fragment collection with an attachment point, you can click
the <span class="GUI">Collections</span> button. The <span

<dd><p>Import a fragment collection from the Workspace, the Project table, or a
file. Displays a menu from which you can choose the source. If you choose to
import from a file, a file selector opens in which you can locate and load the
fragment collection, which must have a <code>.bld</code> extension . By default,
the file selector opens in a directory containing a set of
Schr&ouml;dinger-supplied fragments that you can load and select from. The file
name is displayed in the text box below the buttons. If you opened the panel
from the command line, importing from file is the only choice, and the file
selector opens immediately. When importing an entry group from the Project
Table, the collection is named after the entry group.</p>
<p>
The structures that are imported must have been prepared either with the
CombiGlide reagent preparation procedure or by using the <a

Fragment Collection</span> panel</a>, which you open with the <span

to a file, a file selector opens, in which you can navigate to the location and
name the file.  If you opened the panel from the command line, importing from
file is the only choice, and the file selector opens immediately. The default
file location is My Collections. If you export to the Project Table, the
fragments are exported as an entry group that is named after the collection file.

<p>This table lists the attachments that are defined in the current
combinatorial definition. The first column is an index and is color-coded to
match the position in the display area of the <span class="GUI">Combinatorial
Library</span> tab. If no definition is present, the <span class="GUI">Fragment
Collection</span> tab and the <span class="GUI">Create</span> panel can still be
used to build and save fragment collections for later use. The row for the
current position is highlighted in olive-green. If the associated collection is
modified, the highlighting changes to red.
