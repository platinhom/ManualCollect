<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Reorder the atom numbers in a comparison structure to match the ordering in a
reference structure either automatically or by manual selection on two diagrams
or from two lists.
</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Reorder Atoms Dialog Box</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Reorder Atoms</span> dialog box, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Click <span class="GUI">Reorder Product Atoms</span> in the 
<span class="GUI">Reaction Path Interpolation</span> panel.</p></li>
</ul>


<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Reorder Atoms Dialog Box</h2> 


<p>There are several ways in which you can use this dialog box to map the atoms
of the comparison structure to those of the reference structure.
</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Use the automated detection (guess) tools. Select a guess method and
click <span class="GUI">Guess</span>. The guessed atoms are marked in light
blue. If the guess is good, click <span class="GUI">Accept Guess</span>; if not,
click <span class="GUI">Reject Guess</span>. The atoms are marked in green if
the guess is accepted; if it is rejected the markers are removed.
</p></li>

<li><p>Pick corresponding atoms in the two diagrams. First, pick a reference
atom, which is then marked with a yellow square. Then pick the corresponding
comparison atom. The atoms are marked with green markers. 
</p></li>

<li><p>Pick corresponding atoms in the two lists, reference first. The atoms are
also marked in the diagrams when you pick them.
</p></li>

</ol>

<p>If you make a mistake in the mapping, you can simply select the mis-mapped
atom in the reference diagram or list, and then select the correct atom in the
comparison diagram or list.
</p>


<p>If you want to clear the entire mapping and start over, click <span
class="GUI">Clear Mapping</span>.

<dl>

<a name="feature1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Guess method</span> options</dt>
<dd><p>Choose a guess method for automatically mapping the atom numbers of
the comparison structure to match the reference structure. 
</p>

<dl>

<dt>Monatomic elements</dt>
<dd><p>Map atoms for elements that only occur once in the reference structure
and in the comparison structure.
</p></dd>

<dt>Unique SMILES order - conformers only</dt>
<dd><p>Map atoms on the basis of the order in the unique SMILES string for the
entire reference structure or comparison structure. The reference structure and
the comparison structure must be conformers (no changes in bonding). This method
might not be able to determine the mapping of hydrogen atoms.  
</p></dd>

<dt>SMARTS patterns of whole molecule or unique atoms</dt>
<dd><p>Map atoms on the basis of SMARTS patterns, either of individual atoms or
of whole molecules. If a SMARTS pattern has only one match in the reference
structure and one match in the comparison structure, use that pattern to map the
atom numbers. The SMARTS patterns for unique atoms identify individual atoms
solely on the basis of their bonding pattern, with no account taken of the
identity of the atoms to which they are bonded.  
</p></dd>

<dt>Based on superimposed 3D structures</dt>
<dd><p>Superimpose the comparison structure on the reference structure, and map
each comparison atom to the  closest reference atom of the same element. If
there is no nearby atom of the same element, the mapping of the atom is not
done. This method uses the already-mapped atoms for the superposition, so there
must be at least threee atoms mapped before this method can be used.
</p></dd>

<dt>Use all methods</dt>
<dd><p>Use all of the applicable methods to determine the mapping between the
reference and comparison atoms.
</p></dd>

</dl>

</dd>

<a name="feature2"></a>
<dt>Guess buttons</dt>
<dd><p>Use these buttons to apply the guess method to determine atom mappings. 
</p>

<ul>

<li><p><span class="GUI">Guess</span>&mdash;Click this button to identify
corresponding atoms based on the guess method. The identified atoms are marked
in blue on the diagrams. Once a guess is made, you must either accept or
reject it before any other mappings can be made.
</p></li>

<li><p><span class="GUI">Accept Guess</span>&mdash;Accept the current guess as
the correct mapping. The identified atoms are marked in green on the diagrams. 
</p></li>

<li><p><span class="GUI">Reject Guess</span>&mdash;Reject the current guess as
an incorrect mapping. The blue markers are removed from the diagrams.
</p></li>

</ul>

</dd>

<a name="feature3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Automatically map hydrogens and monatomic elements</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Whenever a change is made to the mapping, any hydrogens attached to
mapped atoms are mapped if possible, and any remaining atoms that are the only
remaining unmapped instances of an element are also mapped. The mapping of
hydrogens is done as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the reference atom and the corresponding comparison atom have only one
hydrogen, that hydrogen is mapped.</li>
<li>If the reference atom and the corresponding comparison atom have the same
number of hydrogens (more than one), and the dihedral angles for the hydrogens
in the reference structure can be matched to dihedral angles for the hydrogens
in the comparison structure, the hydrogens are mapped.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<a name="feature4"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Reference</span> structure display</dt>
<dd><p>This area displays the 2D structure of the reference. The
atom numbering is indicated on the structure, and the numbers are colored by
element. Atoms that are mapped are marked with a green sphere; atoms for which
the mapping has been guessed but not yet accepted are marked with light blue
spheres. You can select an atom to start defining a mapping. The atom can be an
unmapped atom or it can be an already mapped atom. The selected atom is marked
with a yellow square.  If you pause the pointer over a mapped atom, it is marked
with a green square, and the mapped atom in the comparison structure is also
marked with a green square. This also happens if you select a mapped 
atom, which allows you to identify which atom it is currently mapped to.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature5"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Comparison</span> structure display</dt>
<dd><p>This area displays the 2D comparison structure. The
atom numbering is indicated on the structure, and the numbers are colored by
element. Atoms that are mapped are marked with a green sphere; atoms for which
the mapping has been guessed but not yet accepted are marked with light blue
spheres. You can select an atom to complete the mapping to the atom selected in
the reference structure. The reference atom and the selected atom are marked in
green and the yellow square is removed from the reference atom. If you pause the
pointer over a mapped atom, it is marked with a green square, and the mapped
atom in the reference structure is also marked with a green square. 
</p></dd>

<a name="feature6"></a>
<dt>Atom lists</dt>
<dd><p>These lists show the atom numbering in the reference and the comparison
structure, with the element label first and the atom number next. The reference
rows are terminated with a dash prior to mapping; the mapped comparison atom
number is added after the dash when a reference atom is mapped. Rows for
unmapped atoms are white; rows for mapped atoms are colored green; rows for
guessed mappings are colored light blue.</p>
<p>
Whe you select a row in the reference atom list, it is selected and marked in
the diagram. When you select a row in the comparison atom list, it is mapped to
the selected atom in the reference atom list, and the two rows are colored
green. 
</p></dd>

</dl>

<a name="feature7"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Clear Mapping</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Clear the entire mapping. All markers are removed, and all comparison
atom numbers are removed from the reference atom list.
