<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Calculate the density of a model system using MD simulations at a single
temperature, or as a function of temperature to generate data for evaluation of
the coefficient of thermal expansion and the glass transition temperature
(T<sub>g</sub>).</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Thermophysical Properties Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Thermophysical Properties</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Applications &rarr; Materials Science &rarr; Thermophysical Properties &rarr; Perform Calculations</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Tasks &rarr; Materials &rarr; Thermophysical Properties &rarr; Perform Calculations</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
</ul>


<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Thermophysical Properties Panel</h2> 


<p>Thermophysical properties are generated from a set of molecular dynamics
simulations on a model system over a range of temperatures. The simulations
involve a relaxation stage for the input system, then a set of simulations 
in the NPT ensemble to obtain a converged density for the system. 
</p>
<p>You can run the simulations for the temperatures simultaneously, starting
each by running the relaxation protocol at the given temperature then the
simulations to converge the density, or you can run the simulations
sequentially, using the converged system for one temperature as input for the
next temperature. The former choice may result in faster throughput, though it
involves extra time for relaxation. In either case, the individual simulations
can be run on a GPU host, which you can choose in the <span class="GUI">Job
Settings</span> dialog box.
</p>
<p>When the job finishes, the density and its standard deviation from each
simulation are written as properties to the output Maestro file along with 
the input structure. The density properties are
named <span class="GUI">Density(g/cm3) @ <i>T</i></span> 
and <span class="GUI">stdev Density(g/cm3) @ <i>T</i></span>, where <i>T</i> is
the temperature value in kelvin. The results of the individual simulations are
also returned but are not incorporated into the Maestro project.
</p>
<p>If you chose to compute the density ove a range of temperatures, you can
calculate the coefficient of thermal expansion and the glass transition
temperature, using the <a href="thermophysical_properties_analysis.html"><span 
class="GUI">Thermophysical Properties Analysis</span> panel</a>.

<dt><span class="GUI">Model system</span> section</dt>
<dd><p>Specify the model system, which must be already prepared for a Desmond
simulation. 
You can use the <a href="../desmond/system_builder.html"><span class="GUI">System
Builder</span> panel</a> to prepare the model system for any structure that you
have. If you want to build an amorphous structure from scratch, you can use the 
<a href="disordered_system_builder.html"><span class="GUI">Disordered
System Builder</span> panel</a> to create a model system.
</p>
<p>The option menu offers two choices for the source of the model system:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Load from Workspace</span>&mdash;Load the model system
from the Workspace. When you choose this option,
the <span class="GUI">Load</span> button is displayed to the right of the menu. 
Click this button to load the model system.
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Import from file</span>&mdash;Import the model system
from a file, which must be a Desmond CMS file. When you choose this
option, a text box and <span class="GUI">Browse</span> button are displayed to
the right of the menu. You can enter the name of the file in the text box, or
click <span class="GUI">Browse</span> and navigate to the file.

<dd><p>Select this option to calculate the density over a range of temperatures.
You can set the lowest and highest temperatures and the increment in temperature
in the text boxes. The actual temperatures are generated by incrementing the
lowest temperature. The highest temperature used is the one given in the text
box (even if it is not in the series formed by incrementing the lowest
temperature). This choice allows you to calculate the coefficient of thermal
expansion and the glass transition temperature, using the 
<a href="thermophysical_properties_analysis.html"><span class="GUI">Thermophysical
Properties Analysis</span> panel</a>.

specify the temperature in the text box. This choice gives you the density at
the specified temperature, but no other properties.

<dt><span class="GUI">Density simulation time</span> text box</dt>

system at a specific temperature. The time should be sufficient to converge the
density, but may not exceed 200 ns.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature3.2">
<dt><span class="GUI">Maximum density simulation cycles</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>Specify the maximum number of density simulations to perform to obtain a
converged density. If the density does not converge in a simulation, another
simulation is started from the output of the unconverged simulation, and this
process is repeated until the density converges or the maximum number of density
simulations specified here is reached. The total simulation time over all
simulation cycles (product of the density simulation time and the maximum
cycles) must not exceed 200ns.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature3.3">
<dt><span class="GUI">Run multiple temperatures simultaneously</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Select this option to run the simulation for each temperature at the same
time. For each temperature, the relaxation protocol is run on the initial model
system at that temperature prior to the simulation to converge the density.
Select this option if you have multiple CPUs or GPUs available over which to
distribute the simulations.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature3.4">
<dt><span class="GUI">Start each temperature with the converged system from the previous temperature</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Select this option to run the simulations sequentially, starting from the
highest temperature. The relaxation protocol is run on the model system at the
highest temperature, followed by the simulation to converge the density at that
temperature. The results are then used to start the simulation to converge the
density at the next temperature. You can use a GPU to speed up the individual
simulations.

incorporation of the job into the Maestro project, the job name, the host,
the distribution of subjobs, and any other application-specific job settings.

<dt><span class="GUI">Job status</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>This icon indicates when there are jobs running for the application that

stops when there are no more jobs running. If a job fails to start, it changes
to an exclamation point. 
</p>
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/job_status.png" />
<p>
Clicking the button shows a small job status window that lists the job name and
status for all active jobs submitted from the current panel (for Jaguar and
MacroModel this means all jobs from any of the application panels). You can
double-click on a row to open the <a href="../misc/monitor_panel.html"><span
class="GUI">Monitor</span> panel</a> and monitor the job, or click the <span
class="GUI">Monitor</span> button to open the <span class="GUI">Monitor</span>
panel and close the job status window. The job status is updated while the
window is open. If a job finishes while the window is open, the job remains
displayed but with the new status.  The rows are colored according to the
status: yellow for submitted, green for launched, running, or finished, red for
incorporated, died, or killed.  Click anywhere outside the window to close it.

<dd><p>The status bar displays information about the current job settings for the
panel. This includes the job name, task name and task settings (if any), number
of subjobs (if any) and the host name and job incorporation setting. It also
displays a message for a short time when you start a new job.</p>
<p>The status bar also contains the <span class="GUI">Help</span> button, which
