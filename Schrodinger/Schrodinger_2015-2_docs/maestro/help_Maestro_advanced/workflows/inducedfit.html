<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
This panel allows you to set up a sequence of jobs in which ligands are docked
with Glide, then Prime Refinement is used to allow the receptor to relax, and
the ligands are redocked into the relaxed receptor with Glide.
</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Induced Fit Docking Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Induced Fit Docking</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Applications &rarr; Induced Fit Docking</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
</ul>


<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Induced Fit Docking Panel</h2> 


<p>The Induced Fit Docking protocol aims to improve the docking of ligands in
which it is believed that the receptor adjusts significantly to the presence of
the ligand. The protocol performs a constrained minimization of the receptor
followed by initial Glide docking of the ligands using a softened potential. A
select set of the docked poses is passed on to Prime for a refinement
step. After a Prime side-chain prediction and minimization, the best receptor
structures for each ligand are passed back to Glide for redocking of the ligand.
</p>

<p>There are actually two protocols, a standard protocol (the original protocol)
and an extended sampling protocol (introduced in the 2013-1 release).</p>
<p>The standard protocol involves manual selection of a limited set 
of options for preparing the receptor to accommodate the ligand in the initial
docking stage, by trimming residues. It also provides a choice of Glide
precision in the final docking stage.</p>

<p>The extended sampling protocol handles the receptor preparation in an
automated fashion, choosing the residues to trim and setting atom-specific van
der Waals scaling factors on the basis of solvent-accessible surface areas,
B-factors (if present), the existence of salt bridges, rotamer searches. The
initial docking stage generates a large number of poses, which are clustered and
filtered to produce up to 80 poses per ligand to pass to the Prime stage. The
scoring of the final docked poses is based on Glide SP, so there is no need to
select the Glide precision.
</p>

<p>The <span class="GUI">Induced Fit Docking</span> panel collects
the relevant controls for each part of the protocol, with judicious selection of
defaults for options that are not presented in the panel.</p>

<p>Preparation of the receptor structure prior to its use with the protocol is
essential for good results. The requirements and a procedure for preparing the
protein are described in the document <a
href="../../../inducedfit/inducedfit_user_manual.pdf"><i>Induced Fit
Docking</i></a>. To open this document, click the link just given, or choose 
<span class="GUI">Help &rarr; Documentation Index</span> in the main window, then click on
the link to the document.</p>

<p><b>To set up an induced fit docking calculation:</b></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Select the source of the ligands to be docked from the <span
class="GUI">Ligands to be docked</span> option menu. The ligands must be
properly prepared (for example, by using LigPrep) You can dock ligands from a 
file or from the Project Table. To dock ligands from a file, specify a file
name, or browse to the ligand file, which must be a Maestro format file,
compressed or uncompressed.
</p></li>
<li><p>Set up the receptor grid in the <span class="GUI">Receptor</span> tab.
For this purpose, the receptor must be displayed in the Workspace, with or
without the ligand. If a ligand is not displayed, you must use define the center
of the enclosing box in terms of receptor residues. The protein must be properly
prepared for a Glide calculation.
</p></li>
<li><p>(Optional) Set up constraints. You can set up hydrogen bonding and metal
constraints to the receptor with either protocol, and core constraints with the
<span class="GUI">Extended Sampling</span> protocol.  The atoms you pick for
H-bond and metal constraints must be H atoms on H-bond donors or H-bond acceptor
atoms, or metal atoms. The constraints that  you select are all applied during
docking. You can also choose the stages in which to apply the constraints. Core
constraints are applied in all stages. 
</p></li>
<li><p>Select conformational sampling options in the <span
class="GUI">Ligands</span> tab. 
</p></li>
<li><p>For the <span class="GUI">Standard</span> protocol, set the initial
docking options in the <span class="GUI">Glide Docking</span> tab. The tasks in
this tab are to perform protein preparation, remove residue side chains (by
mutating temporarily to alanine) that might move in the real system, scale the
van der Waals radii if necessary, select the docking mode, and decide how many
poses to keep per ligand. The defaults represent reasonable choices. 
</p></li>
<li><p>Select the residues that are refined in the Prime Refinement stage.
You can add residues that you know to be important, even if they don't lie
within the specified distance of the ligand &ndash; for example, the remainder
of a loop that moves when the ligand binds. You can also select residues that
should not be refined, such as those bound to a metal ion.
</p></li>
<li><p>For the <span class="GUI">Standard</span> protocol, set the energy
threshold and the the number of poses to keep in the Glide redocking step, and
the docking accuracy (SP or XP). This step is expensive because a new grid is
generated for each input structure. Setting tight thresholds will reduce the
cost, and is especially desirable for XP docking.
</p></li>

<li><p>Set job options in the <span class="GUI">Jobs</span> tab. If you want to
distribute the Prime and Glide jobs, enter the number of CPUs for each.
When you start the job, make sure you select a multiprocessor host.
</p></li>
<li><p>Enter a job name in the <span class="GUI">Job name</span> text box, and
click <span class="GUI">Run</span>, or choose <span class="GUI">Job
Settings</span> from the <span class="GUI">Settings</span> button menu,</p>
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/settings.png" />
<p>choose the host and set the job name in the <span class="GUI">Job
Settings</span> dialog box, and click <span class="GUI">Run</span>.
</p></li>
</ol>

<p>When the job finishes, the final poses with their scores are written to a
Maestro file in the job launch directory, named
<i>jobname</i><tt>-out.maegz</tt>.  You can view the results in Maestro by
importing the file. The final IFDScore score for each pose in the Standard
protocol is calculated as the GlideScore plus 1/20th of the Prime energy. The
IFDScore score in the Extended Sampling protocol is based on Glide SP
descriptors.</p>

<p>If you want to change any of the options for which controls are not provided
in this panel, you can choose <span class="GUI">Write</span> from the <span
class="GUI">Settings</span> button menu, and the files for the calculation are
written. You can then run the calculations from the command line. See the <a
href="../../../inducedfit/inducedfit_user_manual.pdf"
target="pdfmanuals"><i>Induced Fit Docking</i></a> manual for information on the
keywords in the input file.

class="GUI">Job Settings</span> dialog box</a>. The arrow to the right opens
a menu, from which you can make settings or perform actions that are related to
the job. </p>
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/settings.png" />
<p>The menu items are described below.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="GUI">Job Settings</span>&mdash;Make and save settings for the
incorporation of the job into the Maestro project, the job name, the host,
the distribution of subjobs, and any other application-specific job settings.
Opens the <span class="GUI">Job Settings</span> dialog box.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Preferences</span>&mdash;Set general preferences for
running jobs. Opens the <span class="GUI">Preferences</span> panel at the <a
href="../maestro_menu/preferences.html#jobs_starting"><span class="GUI">Jobs - 
Starting</span> section</a>.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Write</span>&mdash;Write the input files for the job but do not start it. 
The file names are based on the current job name, and the files are written to
a subdirectory of the current working directory that is named with the job
name.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Reset Panel</span>&mdash;Reset the values in the panel to 
their defaults.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Job status</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>This icon indicates when there are jobs running for the application that
belong to the current project. It starts spinning when the first job starts, and
stops when there are no more jobs running. If a job fails to start, it changes
to an exclamation point. 
</p>
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/job_status.png" />
<p>
Clicking the button shows a small job status window that lists the job name and
status for all active jobs submitted from the current panel (for Jaguar and
MacroModel this means all jobs from any of the application panels). You can
double-click on a row to open the <a href="../misc/monitor_panel.html"><span
class="GUI">Monitor</span> panel</a> and monitor the job, or click the <span
class="GUI">Monitor</span> button to open the <span class="GUI">Monitor</span>
panel and close the job status window. The job status is updated while the
window is open. If a job finishes while the window is open, the job remains
displayed but with the new status.  The rows are colored according to the
status: yellow for submitted, green for launched, running, or finished, red for
incorporated, died, or killed.  Click anywhere outside the window to close it.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Run</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Run the job with the current job settings.
</p></dd>
</dl>


<a name="status_bar"></a>
<h3>Status bar</h3>
<p>The status bar displays information about the current job settings for the
panel. This includes the job name, task name and task settings (if any), number
of subjobs (if any) and the host name and job incorporation setting. It also
displays a message for a short time when you start a new job.</p>
<p>The status bar also contains the <span class="GUI">Help</span> button, which
opens the help topic for the panel.</p>
