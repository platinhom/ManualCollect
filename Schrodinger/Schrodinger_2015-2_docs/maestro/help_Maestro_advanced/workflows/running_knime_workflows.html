<p>KNIME workflows can be created, installed, and run from Maestro. With some
special configuration of the workflow, structures and data can be transferred
between Maestro and KNIME, so that you can use Maestro for structure
manipulation and input, and store the results of the workflow in the Maestro
project.
</p> 

<p>Maestro does not run the workflows directly, however: it is done via a Python
panel, which is created from a specially configured workflow. To configure an
existing workflow or build a new workflow that is configured for running from
Maestro, choose <span class="GUI">Workflows &rarr; KNIME &rarr; New</span>. This
action starts KNIME, where you can import or build a workflow and make the
appropriate settings, and then creates the Python script for the workflow when
you close KNIME. You can then test the script and install it onto the 
<span class="GUI">KNIME Workflows</span> submenu of the <span
class="GUI">Workflows</span> menu. 
</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> You can build the workflow and make settings in a regular KNIME
session, but the Python panel for running the workflow from Maestro is only
created when you run KNIME with <span class="GUI">Workflows &rarr; KNIME
Workflows &rarr; New</span>.
</p>

<p>Configuration of the input and output to communicate with Maestro is done by
editing the node names of the Molecule Reader and Writer nodes, the CSV Writer
node, and by adding Quick Form nodes that are used to set options, with an
edited node name. 
</p>
<p>For structure input, the Molecule Reader node name must contain either
&quot;Selected entries&quot; or &quot;Included entries&quot;. For structure
output, the Molecule Writer node name must contain &quot;New group&quot;. To
display an information box with results, use a CSV Writer node with a name that
includes &quot;Maestro message&quot;. To run Maestro commands, use a CSV Writer
node with a name that includes &quot;Maestro commands&quot;. See 
<a href="knime_workflow_directions.html">Editing KNIME Workflows for Use with
Maestro</a> for details.
</p>
<p>To specify options or parameters, use a Quick Form node, and include
<code>GUIsetting</code> in the node name. For the String Radio Button nodes, the
node name must contain <code>GUIsettingRADIO</code> to be shown in the panel as
a radio button group, or <code>GUIsettingCOMBO</code> to be exposed as a combo
box (option menu). Configure these nodes with the labels you want to use on the
radio buttons or the option menu, the default values, and the values displayed
for each menu item or radio button. The GUI components for these nodes are then
added to the Python panel that is created to run the workflow. 
</p>

<p>Knime workflows are run from Maestro via Python panels, which are installed
on the <span class="GUI">KNIME</span> submenu of the <span
class="GUI">Workflows</span> menu. These panels have the same structure, with
controls that depend on the workflow. See the <a
href="knime_workflow.html">KNIME Workflow Panel</a> topic for details on how
to run an installed workflow.
</p>


<p>The KNIME workflows can be created, managed, and installed with the following
items on the <span class="GUI">KNIME Workflows</span> submenu of the <span
class="GUI">Workflows</span> menu:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p><span class="GUI">New</span>&mdash;Open a new KNIME session to build or
import a workflow for installation into Maestro.
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Manage</span>&mdash;Reorder workflows or group them
into categories, which appear as submenus under <span class="GUI">Workflows
&rarr; KNIME Workflows</span>.
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Install</span>&mdash;Install a workflow that has
already been set up to run from Maestro.
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Update</span>&mdash;Update the Schr&ouml;dinger
workflows with the latest versions from the web site.
</p></li>
</ul>
