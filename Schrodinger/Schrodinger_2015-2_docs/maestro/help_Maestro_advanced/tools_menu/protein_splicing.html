<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Splice a contiguous set of residues from a source protein into an aligned
target protein, removing residues from the target protein to accommodate the new
protein segment. The region around the join points is minimized but no other
refinement of the spliced segment is done.
</p>

<h2>Opening the Protein Splicing Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Protein Splicing</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Tools &rarr; Protein Splicing</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Tasks &rarr; Protein Refinement &rarr; Protein Splicing</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Using the Protein Splicing Panel</h2> 


<p>Protein splicing is performed by taking a segment of one protein and
replacing a segment of another protein with the source segment. The proteins are
aligned temporarily if they are not already aligned, so that the segment can be
simply transferred between the source and the destination. The regions around
the attachment points are minimized, but otherwise no change is made to the
spliced segment. This is intended to be a quick means of transferring residues
from one protein to another.</p>
<p>
Prior to splicing a segment of a protein into another protein, you may want to
perform a structural alignment of the two proteins, so that the termini of the
desired source and destination segments are aligned to each other. This gives
you more control over the alignment than the automatic global alignment done as
part of the procedure.
</p>

<p>Once the source segment is defined, possible attachment points on the
(aligned) destination protein are identified. The attachment atoms are the
carbonyl carbon on the C-terminus end and the nitrogen on the N-terminus
end. Any attachment atoms in the destination that are within 8&nbsp;&Aring; of
the attachment atoms of the source segment are considered as potential
attachment points. Of these possible attachment points, the default is selected
to preserve the residue numbering if possible, otherwise the attachment atom
that forms the shortest peptide bond with the segment is taken. The preservation
of the numbering assumes that the splicing is being done between two different
structures of the same (or similar) protein, with the same residue numbering.
</p>

<p>The splicing is done by temporarily aligning the source protein to the
destination if necessary; extracting the source segment and deleting the
destination segment (between the attachment points); assigning the destination
chain ID to the spliced segment and renumbering the residues to continue from
the N-terminal attachment residue numbering. If a duplicate residue number is
found, the residue in the spliced segment is assigned a number that is higher
than any found in the destination chain. The new segment is attached at the
attachment points (or point, for a terminal attachment), and all atoms within 6
bonds of the attachment points are minimized. A new project entry is created for
the modified protein.
</p>
<p>Apart from the minimization around the attachment points, no attempt is made
to relieve strain or clashes with the rest of the target protein. Once the
splicing is done, you should run a refinement on the spliced segment and its
local environment. 
</p>


<p>To splice a segment of one protein (the source) into another protein (the
destination):
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Include both proteins in the Workspace.</p>
<p>You can include more than one protein in the Workspace, but only one protein
can be selected as the destination. You might want to do this to identify
variable and conserved regions in a set of related proteins, to guide the
selection of the segment to splice. 
</p></li>
<li><p>If the proteins are already aligned, select <span class="GUI">Proteins
are already structurally aligned to each other</span>.</p>
<p>This should be done before defining the source segment: once it is defined,
the proteins are aligned temporarily if they aren't already.
</p></li>

<li><p>Select a contiguous set of residues in the source protein.</p>
<p>It is probably easiest to do this in the sequence viewer, which is displayed
automatically when you open the panel. If you make the selection in the
Workspace, it is filled out to entire resides. You must make sure the residues
are attached in a continuous chain.</p>
<p>Once the residues are selected, the segment selected is reported in the top
part of the panel, and the option menus are filled in with the list of possible
destination proteins and the residues on the destination to which the splicing
could be done.
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose the destination protein, if you have more than two proteins in the
Workspace. 
</p></li>
<li><p>Change the selection of the attachment residues, if necessary.</p>
<p>The source segment is attached to these two residues, and the residues
between them (but not including them) is deleted.</p>
<p>If you want to splice the tail of a protein onto another protein, you can
choose <span class="GUI">None</span> as an attachment residue on the C or the N
terminal end. You should only do this for one attachment point: setting both to
<span class="GUI">None</span> results in an error message.
</p></li>
<li><p>Click <span class="GUI">Splice</span>.</p>
<p>The segment is spliced into the destination protein, and the new protein is
added to the project as a new entry and replaces the Workspace. The panel then
closes.</p></li>

<a name="feature1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Residues will be spliced into</span> option menu</dt>
<dd><p>This option menu lists the proteins that are displayed in the Workspace
other than the source protein. Select the protein you want to splice into from
this option menu. The connection option menus are updated when you choose a
protein. 
</p></dd>

<a name="feature2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">and connected to residues <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i></span> option menus</dt>
<dd><p>These option menus specify the residues in the destination to which the
source segment will be attached (the attachment residues). You can choose a
different residue from the list if the default residue is not the one you want
to attach to. If you need to identify the residues, you should be careful not to
select a residue in the Workspace, as this will change the source segment. You
can identify the residues by using atom feedback: pause the pointer over an
atom in the Workspace, and its identity, including the residue number, is
displayed in the status bar. 
</p></dd>

<a name="feature3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Proteins are already structurally aligned to each other</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Select this option if you have already aligned the protein structures. If
this option is not selected, temporary alignments are done as part of the
process. 
</p></dd>

<a name="feature4"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Splice</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Splice the source segment into the destination. A project entry is
created for the spliced structure, and it replaces the Workspace. The panel
closes once the splicing is done.
