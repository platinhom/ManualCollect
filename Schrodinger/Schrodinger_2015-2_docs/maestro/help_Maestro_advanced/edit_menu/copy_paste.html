<p>Maestro allows you to copy structures from the Workspace or other locations,
and paste them into the Workspace. 
</p>

<h3>Copying or Cutting Workspace Structures</h3>

<p>To copy the Workspace selection onto the clipboard, you can choose 
<span class="GUI">Edit &rarr; Copy</span> or
press <span class="Keys">Ctrl+C</span> (<span class="Keys">&#x2318;C</span>).
</p>
<p>To cut the Workspace selection, placing it onto the clipboard and removing
the atoms from the Workspace structure, you can choose 
<span class="GUI">Edit &rarr; Cut</span> or
press <span class="Keys">Ctrl+X</span> (<span class="Keys">&#x2318;X</span>).
</p>
<p>The clipboard stores the atoms in the selection in Maestro format and SMILES
format. The SMILES string can be pasted into another application; the atoms can
be pasted back into the Workspace.</p>

<p>You can also copy the selection as a SMARTS pattern, which you can do with
<span class="GUI">Edit &rarr; Copy as SMARTS</span>
</p>

<h3>Pasting Structures into the Workspace</h3>

<p>To paste a structure from the clipboard into the Workspace, you can choose 
<span class="GUI">Edit &rarr; Paste</span> or
press <span class="Keys">Ctrl+V</span> (<span class="Keys">&#x2318;V</span>).
The structure can be a SMILES string, a structure from ChemDraw or Isis Draw
(Windows) or a set of atoms previously cut or copied from the Workspace.
On Linux, you can paste a SMILES string that is in the selection buffer by
choosing <span class="GUI">Edit &rarr; Paste Special &rarr; Selected Text</span>.
</p>
<p>
If the structure is a SMILES string, it is converted into a 2D structure. The
2D structure is added to the project as a new entry, with the SMILES string for
the structure as the title. No attempt is made at 3D conversion. 
You should consider running <a href="../ligprep/ligprep.html">LigPrep</a> to
convert the structure to 3D. 
However, you can perform a 2D to 3D conversion as part of the pasting procedure
by choosing <span class="GUI">Edit &rarr; Paste Special &rarr; As 3D</span>.
</p>
<p>If you paste a set of atoms that were cut or copied from Maestro, they are
placed at the coordinates at which they were cut or copied onto the clipboard.
If you want to choose the location to paste the atoms, 
choose <span class="GUI">Edit &rarr; Paste Special &rarr; By Placing</span> or press <span class="Keys">Ctrl+Shift+V</span> (<span class="Keys">&#x21E7;&#x2318;V</span>), 
then click in the Workspace where you want the centroid of the atoms to be
located. You can paste atoms from one Maestro session into another session.
</p>
<p>When you paste atoms into the Workspace, they are added to an entry. If there
is no entry in the Workspace, a new project entry is created. If there is a
single entry in the Workspace, the pasted atoms are added to that entry. If more
than one entry is in the Workspace, you are prompted to choose one of the
entries or to create a new entry.
