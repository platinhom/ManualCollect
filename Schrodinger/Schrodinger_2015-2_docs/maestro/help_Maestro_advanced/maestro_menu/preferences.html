<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>This panel is used to set application-wide preferences. These preferences are
preserved between Maestro sessions. Preferences are applied immediately, unless
otherwise noted in the panel.
</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Preferences Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Preferences</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Maestro &rarr; Preferences</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
<li><p>Press  <span class="Keys">Ctrl+,</span> (<span class="Keys">&#x2318;,</span>) in the main window.
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The preferences panel is also opened at a particular tab by clicking the 
<span class="GUI">Preferences</span> button or choosing <span
class="GUI">Preferences</span> from a menu in a number of panels.
</p>

<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Preferences Panel</h2> 


<p>Preferences are categorized into groups, and many of the groups are divided
into subgroups.  Several of the preferences are included in more than one
group or subgroup, to make them easier to find. The groups and subgroups are
listed in the tree structure on the right. To display the subgroups for a group,
click the turner to the right of the group name. To display the preferences in a
group or subgroup, click the group or subgroup name. 
</p>
<p>You can search for text in any of the preferences, tooltips,  preference
headings, or tree text. As you type text into tht <span
class="GUI">Search</span> text box, the tree is pruned to show only the parts
that contain the text, and the groups are opened so that you can see the
subgroups. To show the full tree again, click the clear button. 
</p>

<a name="features"></a> 
<h2>Preferences Panel Features</h2> 


<p>The preferences panel has a tree view of the preference groups and subgroups
on the left in a scrolling pane. When a group or subgroup is selected, the
settings for the group or subgroup are displayed on the right. Some settings are
available in more than one subgroup. Below the tree is a search text field and
button for clearing the text field.

<dd><p>These settings determine some of the directories that are used by
Maestro.</p>
<dl>
<dt><span class="GUI">Default directory for job startup and file i/o</span>
options</dt>
<dd>
<p>When you choose any of the options below, the current working directory is
set to the specified location, and the option you select is stored as a
preference. The current working directory is set to the specified location the
next time you start Maestro. </p>
<p>Job files are written by default to the current working directory. File
selectors display the contents of the current working directory when they are
first opened in a Maestro session. Subsequently each file selector stores the
last location you visted, and displays the files in that location when you open
it again.</p>
<p>Thus, these options set the default by changing the current working
directory immediately, on Maestro startup, and when a project is opened if the
option is project-related.
</p>
<p>
If you change the current working directory explicitly after choosing one of
these options, the new directory is used as the location for job files and the
initial location for file selectors, rather than the choice you make from this
set of options. For more information on changing the current working directory,
see <a href="../project_menu/changedir_panel.html">Changing the Working
Directory</a>.</p>
<p>In the descriptions below, the directory is called the <i>default
directory</i>. </p> 

<p><b>Note:</b> If you choose an option for a directory that is inside the
project, you should wait until any jobs launched from that project finish before
you rename the project, or save the project if it is a scratch project.
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Maestro's current working directory</span> option&mdash;
Set the current directory to Maestro's initial working directory. When Maestro
starts, this directory on Linux is the directory from which Maestro was started;
on Windows and Mac it is the <code>Schrodinger</code> folder in your Documents
folder.</p></li>

<li><p><span class="GUI">Parent of project directory</span>&mdash;Set the
current working directory to the parent directory of the current project (the 
directory that the project is in). Opening a different project or closing a
project (which opens a scratch project) sets the current working directory
again.  For zipped projects, the parent directory is the directory that contains
the <code>.prjzip</code> file, rather than the temporary directory into which the
zipped project is extracted.</p>
<p>
Jobs running with this setting are not lost if the project is renamed.</p></li>

<li><p><span class="GUI">Project directory</span>&mdash;Set the current working
directory to the top-level directory inside the current project. This is the
<i>project-name</i><code>.prj</code> directory. This directory changes when a
new project is loaded, and the current working directory is reset to the new
project directory.</p>
<p>Jobs running in this directory will fail if the project is renamed. This
includes saving scratch projects.</p></li>

<li><p><span class="GUI">Project jobs directory</span>&mdash;Set the current
working directory to the project's <code>jobs</code> subdirectory
(<i>project-name</i><code>.prj/jobs</code>). This directory
changes when a new project is loaded or when a scratch project is opened, and
the current working directory is reset to the new jobs directory.</p>
<p>Jobs running in this directory will fail if the project is renamed. This
includes saving scratch projects.</p></li>

<li><p><span class="GUI">Other (specify below)</span>&mdash;Use the specified
directory as the current working directory. When using this option, you must
enter the desired directory name in the <span class="GUI">Directory</span> text
box.</p></li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Custom directory for file i/o</span> options</dt>
<dd><p>Specify the location of the custom directory to use in file selectors. 
The contents of this directory are displayed when you click the <span
class="GUI">Custom</span> icon in a file selector under 
<a href="../misc/fileselector.html#look_in"><span class="GUI">Look in</span></a>.
There are two standard locations that you can select as the custom location, or
you can choose your own location.
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Maestro installation directory</span>&mdash;Set the
custom directory to the directory in the installation that contains the Maestro
software and resources. The actual path is displayed in the tooltip for this option.
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Maestro launch directory</span>&mdash;Set the
custom directory to the directory from which Maestro was started, on Linux, or
the Schrodinger folder in your documents folder on Windows and Mac. The actual
path is displayed in the tooltip for this option.
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Other (specify below)</span>&mdash;Specify the
directory in the <span class="GUI">Directory</span> text box.
</p></li>
</ul>

</dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Temporary project location</span> text box and <span
class="GUI">Browse</span> button </dt>
<dd><p>Specify the location for the storage of temporary (scratch) projects. You
can click <span class="GUI">Browse</span> to navigate to the desired location.
This directory should be large enough for your temporary projects, and for
efficiency should be on a local file system. This location will be used for
temporary projects the next time you start Maestro.</p>
<p>Two environment variables are used to determine a location for the scratch
project. If <code>SCHRODINGER_TEMP_PROJECT</code> is defined, the location it
specifies is used, and overrides the value set here. Otherwise if it is not
defined and a location is not set here, the location defined by <span
class="GUI">TMPDIR</span> is used. Failing any of these, the default is to use
the local application data directory, which on Linux is <span
class="GUI">$HOME/.schrodinger/tmp</span>, and on Windows is
<code>%LOCALAPPDATA%\Schrodinger\tmp</code>. If any of these directories is on
a file system with a limited amount of space, you should consider specifying
another location.

<dt><span class="GUI">Contacts</span> section</dt>
<dd><p>These settings define the distance ratios for contacts and allow the
exclusion of certain types of contacts from consideration as contacts.
</p>
<p>Contacts are classified into three types: good, bad, and ugly. The criteria are
based on the following formula:</p> 
<p>C = D<sub>12</sub> / ( R<sub>1</sub> + R<sub>2</sub>)
</p>
<p>where D<sub>12</sub> is the distance between atomic centers 1 and 2,
and R<sub>1</sub> and R<sub>2</sub> are the van der Waals radii of atomic centers
1 and 2. C must be monotonically increasing for each of the contact types, that is
C(ugly) &lt; C(bad) &lt; C(good). The default values are:</p>
<pre>
good 1.30
bad  0.89
ugly 0.75
</pre>
<p>A contact is considered to belong to a particular type if the value of C is
less than the cutoff value (but greater than any smaller cutoff value). Any
distance ratio larger than the Good cutoff is not considered a contact.

<dd><p>The use of united atom types can cause problems for users who do not want
implicit hydrogen atoms in their structures, such as Jaguar users. United atom
types with implicit hydrogens are assigned by default when hydrogens are deleted
from heavy atoms. If this option is cleared, united atom types are never
assigned when atoms and bonds are explicitly deleted, atoms are retyped, or
structures are drawn freehand. Instead, the atom types remain unchanged, or
explicit radical types are assigned if they are available. United atom types

retained.If this option is selected, they are deleted. For example, if you
delete the carbon atom of a methyl group, the hydrogen atoms attached to the
methyl group are also deleted if this option is selected. If you delete the
middle carbon atom in propane, the two hydrogens attached to this atom are
deleted, but the carbon atoms are not because they are not terminal atoms.

<dt><span class="GUI">Default directory for job startup and file i/o</span>
options</dt>
<dd>
<p>When you choose any of the options below, the current working directory is
set to the specified location, and the option you select is stored as a
preference. The current working directory is set to the specified location the
next time you start Maestro. </p>
<p>Job files are written by default to the current working directory. File
selectors display the contents of the current working directory when they are
first opened in a Maestro session. Subsequently each file selector stores the
last location you visted, and displays the files in that location when you open
it again.</p>
<p>Thus, these options set the default by changing the current working
directory immediately, on Maestro startup, and when a project is opened if the
option is project-related.
</p>
<p>
If you change the current working directory explicitly after choosing one of
these options, the new directory is used as the location for job files and the
initial location for file selectors, rather than the choice you make from this
set of options. For more information on changing the current working directory,
see <a href="../project_menu/changedir_panel.html">Changing the Working
Directory</a>.</p>
<p>In the descriptions below, the directory is called the <i>default
directory</i>. </p> 

<p><b>Note:</b> If you choose an option for a directory that is inside the
project, you should wait until any jobs launched from that project finish before
you rename the project, or save the project if it is a scratch project.
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Maestro's current working directory</span> option&mdash;
Set the current directory to Maestro's initial working directory. When Maestro
starts, this directory on Linux is the directory from which Maestro was started;
on Windows and Mac it is the <code>Schrodinger</code> folder in your Documents
folder.</p></li>

<li><p><span class="GUI">Parent of project directory</span>&mdash;Set the
current working directory to the parent directory of the current project (the 
directory that the project is in). Opening a different project or closing a
project (which opens a scratch project) sets the current working directory
again.  For zipped projects, the parent directory is the directory that contains
the <code>.prjzip</code> file, rather than the temporary directory into which the
zipped project is extracted.</p>
<p>
Jobs running with this setting are not lost if the project is renamed.</p></li>

<li><p><span class="GUI">Project directory</span>&mdash;Set the current working
directory to the top-level directory inside the current project. This is the
<i>project-name</i><code>.prj</code> directory. This directory changes when a
new project is loaded, and the current working directory is reset to the new
project directory.</p>
<p>Jobs running in this directory will fail if the project is renamed. This
includes saving scratch projects.</p></li>

<li><p><span class="GUI">Project jobs directory</span>&mdash;Set the current
working directory to the project's <code>jobs</code> subdirectory
(<i>project-name</i><code>.prj/jobs</code>). This directory
changes when a new project is loaded or when a scratch project is opened, and
the current working directory is reset to the new jobs directory.</p>
<p>Jobs running in this directory will fail if the project is renamed. This
includes saving scratch projects.</p></li>

<li><p><span class="GUI">Other (specify below)</span>&mdash;Use the specified
directory as the current working directory. When using this option, you must
enter the desired directory name in the <span class="GUI">Directory</span> text
box.</p></li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Copy archived job directory to the launch directory when
job finishes (-SAVE)</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>When a job finishes, create a zip file of the temporary directory that the job
used to write files needed for the job (the job directory), and copy it back to
the job launch directory. The zip file is not automatically unzipped.  This
option can be useful if you need to debug a job that fails, and keep the files,
or to use the files for some other purpose. Normally, these files (&quot;scratch
files&quot;) are deleted and the directory is removed when the job
finishes. </p>
<p>This option sends the <code>-SAVE</code> option to Job Control. It is not
saved across Maestro sessions, but it is initialized from the 
<code>SCHRODINGER_SAVE_JOBDIR</code> environment variable. 
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Run the job in the launch directory and keep all files
(-LOCAL)</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>When a job is run, use the launch directory as the temporary location to
write files needed for the job, and leave the files in place when the job
finishes. If the job launches subjobs, the subjobs might not use this directory
for their working directory: the behavior depends on the application. If the
subjobs do not write to the launch directory, you can set the <span
class="GUI">Copy archived job directory to the launch directory when job 
finishes</span> option to copy back the subjob temporary directories. Note that
in this case, the files that are local already are not archived in a zip file. </p>

saved across Maestro sessions.
