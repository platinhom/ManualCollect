<p>In this tutorial, you will set up an FEP calculation in which a ligand
molecule is transformed into other ligand molecules by modification of a
functional group, in the presence of a receptor. The receptor is an engineered
version of the protein lysozyme containing an artificial non-polar cavity. The
ligand is butyl benzene, and it is transformed to ethyl benzene, propyl benzene,
and isobutyl benzene, to determine the relative binding free energies of these
ligands. This is a system where ligand docking calculations often fail, since
the complexes fall outside the narrow range of typical drug-like molecules
binding to common targets that their scoring functions are trained on. The
system represents a rather small receptor and simple ligands, chosen to make
the tutorial simple and relatively fast.

<p>It is assumed that you have access to a host with one or more GPU cards,
which have been configured, that the host has a queueing system with an entry
for the GPU queue in your <span class="GUI">schrodinger.hosts</span> file.
</p>


<h3>Preparing the Receptor and Ligand</h3>
<p>The structure of the ligand-receptor complex is taken from the PDB. X-ray
structures usually need preparation for modeling, to assign bonds, add
hydrogens, remove unwanted molecules, optimize the hydrogen bonding, and
preminimize the structure. This is done in
the <a href="../workflows/protein_preparation.html"><span class="GUI">Protein 
Preparation Wizard</span> panel</a>.
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Click the <span class="GUI">Prep Wiz</span> button on the 
<span class="GUI">Project</span> toolbar.<br style="margin-bottom: 10px;" />
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/PPW.png" />
<br style="margin-bottom: 10px;" /></p>
<p>The <span class="GUI">Protein Preparation Wizard</span> panel opens.
</p></li>

<li><p>In the PDB text box, type <code>186L</code> and
press <span class="Keys">Enter</span>.</p>
<p>The structure of 186L is imported from the PDB and displayed in the
Workspace. It is colored by the PDB conversion status, which can indicate
problems in the structure. The orange molecules are het groups (nonstandard
residues). 
</p></li>

<li><p>In the <span class="GUI">Delete waters beyond</span> text box,
enter <code>0</code>.</p>
<p>All waters are removed, as the system will be solvated later in preparation
for the MD simulations. Water does not play a role in binding here. If it does,
you may want to keep structural waters. The panel provides several ways of
selectively deleting waters.
</p></li>

<li><p>Click <span class="GUI">Preprocess</span>. </p>
<p>The stages of the preprocessing are reported in the status area at the bottom
of the panel as they occur. If any problems are found, a dialog box opens
reporting on these problems. No problems should be reported for this
structure.</p>
<p>When the preprocessing is complete, a new structure is displayed in the
Workspace, colored by element, with green carbons for the het groups.
</p></li>

<li><p>Click the <span class="GUI">Review and Modify</span> tab.</p>
<p>This tab shows the chains, waters, and het groups, and gives you an
opportunity to delete any unwanted groups.
</p></li>

<li><p>Select all except the A:N4B het group in the table.</p>
<p>The Workspace view zooms to the het groups as you select them. You can
disable the zooming by deselecting <span class="GUI">Fit on select</span>.
</p></li>

<li><p>Click <span class="GUI">Delete</span> (above the tables).</p>
<p>The view zooms out to show the entire structure. The only molecules left are
the protein and the butyl benzene. 
</p></li>

<li><p>Click the <span class="GUI">Refine</span> tab.</p>
<p>This tab provides tools to refine the protein structure.
</p></li>

<li><p>In the <span class="GUI">H-bond assignment</span> section,
click <span class="GUI">Optimize</span>.</p>
<p>The optimization takes several seconds, and is reported in the status
area. The protein is labeled with the results of the optimization, which include
flips of terminal amides and tautomerization of a histidine. </p>
<p>If you want to review and change any of these settings, click
<span class="GUI">Interactive Optimizer</span>. 
To remove the labels, choose <span class="GUI">Labels</span> from the <span class="GUI">Delete</span> button on the 
<span class="GUI">Edit</span> toolbar.<br style="margin-bottom: 10px;" />
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/delete.png" />
<br style="margin-bottom: 10px;" />
</p></li>

<li><p>In the <span class="GUI">Restrained minimization</span> section, click
<span class="GUI">Minimize</span>.</p>
<p>When the minimization is done, a new structure is added to the Project Table
and displayed in the Workspace.
</p></li>

</ol>
<p>For each step in the process, a new project entry is created. When you have
completed the steps above, there should be four entries named 186L. The last of
these is the one to use for modeling.
</p>

<h3>Setting Up the Ligands</h3>

<p>To perform the FEP calculations, the structures of each of the ligands must
be provided. The ligands should be suitably placed in the binding cavity, and
the cores should be superimposed, preferably to within an RMSD of 0.5&Aring;.
In this part of the tutorial, you will extract the ligand from the complex and
duplicate it, then edit the duplicates to produce the other ligands. 
In a real situation, you may be using cocrystallized ligands, for which you can
align the ligand cores in
the <a href="../tools_menu/super_panel.html"><span class="GUI">Superposition</span> 
panel</a> using SMARTS patterns.</p>
<p>The ligand in the protein is butyl benzene; from it you will create propyl,
ethyl, and isobutyl benzene.</p>

<p><b>Butyl benzene:</b></p>
<img src="../images/desmond/butyl_benzene.png" />
<ol>
<li><p>In the <a href="../project_menu/entry_list.html"><span class="GUI">Entry
List</span> panel</a>, right-click on the fourth 186L entry and choose
<span class="GUI">Split &rarr; Into Ligands, Water, Other</span>.</p>
<p>The entry is split into two new entries (preserving the original). These
entries are labeled 186L_ligand and 186L_protein.
</p></li>
<li><p>Rename the ligand entry to &quot;butyl benzene&quot; by editing the table cell.
</p></li>
<li><p>Save the project by choosing <span class="GUI">Project &rarr; Save As</span> or
clicking <span class="GUI">Save As</span> button on the 
<span class="GUI">Project</span> toolbar<br style="margin-bottom: 10px;" />
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/saveas.png" />
<br style="margin-bottom: 10px;" />
and providing a name for the project in the project selector that opens,
e.g. &quot;mapper_tutorial&quot;.
</p></li>
</ol>

<p><b>Propyl benzene:</b></p>
<img src="../images/desmond/propyl_benzene.png" />
<ol>
<li><p>Right-click on the entry and choose <span class="GUI">Duplicate &rarr; In Place</span>.
</p></li>

<li><p>Rename the duplicated entry to &quot;propyl benzene&quot; by editing the table cell.
</p></li>

<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI"></span> from the <span class="GUI">Delete</span> button menu on the 
<span class="GUI">Edit</span> toolbar<br style="margin-bottom: 10px;" />
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/delete.png" />
<br style="margin-bottom: 10px;" /> and click
on the terminal carbon of the butyl group.</p> 
<p>The carbon and its attached hydrogens are removed. (If the hydrogens are not
removed, click on them as well. This could happen, depending on your preferences.)
The new terminal carbon is missing a hydrogen, which you will add in the next step.
</p></li>

<li><p>Double-click the <span class="GUI">Add H</span> button on the 
<span class="GUI">Edit</span> toolbar.<br style="margin-bottom: 10px;" />
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/addhydrogens.png" />
<br style="margin-bottom: 10px;" /></p>
<p>A hydrogen atom is added to the terminal carbon.
</p></li>
</ol>

<p><b>Ethyl benzene:</b></p>
<img src="../images/desmond/ethyl_benzene.png" />
<ol>
<li><p>Right-click on the propyl benzene entry in the <span class="GUI">Entry
List</span> panel and choose <span class="GUI">Duplicate &rarr; In Place</span>.
</p></li>

<li><p>Rename the duplicated entry to &quot;ethyl benzene&quot; by editing the table cell.
</p></li>

<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI"></span> from the <span class="GUI">Delete</span> button menu on the 
<span class="GUI">Edit</span> toolbar<br style="margin-bottom: 10px;" />
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/delete.png" />
<br style="margin-bottom: 10px;" /> and click
on the terminal carbon of the propyl group.</p> 
<p>The carbon and its attached hydrogens are removed. </p></li>

<li><p>Double-click the <span class="GUI">Add H</span> button on the 
<span class="GUI">Edit</span> toolbar.<br style="margin-bottom: 10px;" />
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/addhydrogens.png" />
<br style="margin-bottom: 10px;" /></p>
<p>A hydrogen atom is added to the terminal carbon.
</p></li>
</ol>

<p><b>Isobutyl benzene:</b></p>
<img src="../images/desmond/isobutyl_benzene.png" />
<ol>

<li><p>Right-click on the propyl benzene entry (<i>not</i> the ethyl benzene entry)
in the <span class="GUI">Entry List</span> panel and
choose <span class="GUI">Duplicate &rarr; In Place</span>. 
</p></li>

<li><p>Click the <span class="GUI">In</span> column for the duplicated entry to
place it in the Workspace.
</p></li>

<li><p>Rename the duplicated entry to &quot;isobutyl benzene&quot; by editing the table cell.
</p></li>

<li><p>Click the <span class="GUI">Methyl</span> button on the 
<span class="GUI">Fragments</span> toolbar<br style="margin-bottom: 10px;" />
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/build_frag_methyl.png" />
<br style="margin-bottom: 10px;" />
then click one of the hydrogens on the middle cabon of the propyl group.</p>
<p>The hydrogen atom is replaced with a mentyl group. It does not matter which
of the hydrogens you click on. The carbon is colored gray by default. If you
want to change the color, choose <span class="GUI">Element (Custom Carbons)
&rarr; Green</span> from the <span class="GUI">Color Scheme</span> button menu on the 
<span class="GUI">Representation</span> toolbar.<br style="margin-bottom: 10px;" />
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/colorscheme.png" />
<br style="margin-bottom: 10px;" />  
</p></li>

</ol>


<h3>Setting Up the FEP graph</h3>

<p>In this part of the exercise, you will construct a graph of the perturbations
to be performed, in the <span class="GUI">FEP Mapper</span> panel. The graph
construction automatically determines which ligands can be transformed into
other ligands, and displays this information graphically. You can edit it
manually, but often the default mapping is sufficient to run the FEP calculations. 
</p>

<ol>
<li><p>In the <span class="GUI">Entry List</span> panel, click
the <span class="GUI">In</span> column for the prepared protein entry, 
186L_protein, to place it in the Workspace and exclude the ligands.
</p></li>

<li><p>Select the four ligands in the <span class="GUI">Entry List</span> panel,
but do not include them in the Workspace.</p>
<p>You can use the <span class="GUI">Row</span> column when selecting the
entries to ensure that you only do the selection.
</p></li>

<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Applications &rarr; Desmond &rarr; FEP Mapper</span> or 
<span class="GUI">Tasks &rarr; Free Energy Calculations &rarr; FEP Mapper</span>.</p>
<p>The <a href="fep_mapper.html"><span class="GUI">FEP Mapper</span> panel</a> opens.
</p></li>

<li><p>For <span class="GUI">Import from</span>, click <span class="GUI">Project
Table</span>.</p>
<p>After a short delay, the panel is populated. The receptor entry title is
shown above the table that contains the ligands, which lists the four ligands
you selected. The graph area shows the 2D structures of the ligands in boxes,
or &quot;tiles&quot;, with the titles.</p></li>

<li><p>Click <span class="GUI">Generate Map</span>.</p>
<p>A progress dialog box is shown while the map is generated. When the
generation finishes, the tiles are connected with lines. Each of these lines
represents an FEP calculation that will be performed when the job is submitted.</p>
<p>The automatic generation of the graph does not always include all the
perturbations that you want to include. In the current map, there is no
connection between propyl benzene and isobutyl benzene. One way of fixing the
map is to bias it towards selected ligands. 
</p></li>

<li><p>Check the <span class="GUI">Bias</span> check box for propyl benzene, and
click <span class="GUI">Generate Map</span>.</p>
<p>When the graph is redrawn, propyl benzene is connected to both butyl benzene
and isobutyl benzene, but is no longer connected to ethyl benzene.</p>
<p>Another factor that is not included in the graph construction is the
experimental data. Butyl benzene and isobutyl benzene are the strongest binders
experimentally, so it makes sense to add the perturbation between them. This can
be done manually.
</p></li>

<li><p>Click the <span class="GUI">Add new connection</span> button on the toolbar
</p>
<img src="../images/desmond/plus_grayscale.png" />
<p>then click on the isobutyl benzene tile and the butyl benzene tile.</p>
<p>A line is drawn between the two tiles you clicked on. 
</p></li>

<li><p>Enter the experimental free energies in the <span class="GUI">Affinity</span> column:
</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top; padding-right: 20;">
butyl benzene:
</td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">
&minus;6.7
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top; padding-right: 20;">
isobutyl benzene:
</td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">
&minus;6.5
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top; padding-right: 20;">
propyl benzene:
</td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">
&minus;6.5
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top; padding-right: 20;">
ethyl benzene:
</td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">
&minus;5.7
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>It is not necessary to add experimental free energies, as the FEP calculation
does not depend on them. They are used to process the results and prepare data
for the analysis. 
</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>The graph is now set up with all the perturbations that are needed. Only one
is missing: ethyl benzene to propyl benzene. 
</p>

<h3>Setting Up and Running the Job</h3>

<p>FEP calculations involve running a number of &quot;replicas&quot; along the
path from the initial ligand to the final ligand, that represent steps in the
perturbation. Usually there are 12 replicas, each of which can be run separately.
There are 5 ligand transformations in this tutorial, each of which involves 2
FEP jobs: one for transformation in the complex, and one for the transformation
in solvent. Each individual simulation involves building a system, equilibrating
it, and then running a production simulation. So there are at least 120 subjobs
that will be run for this system.</p>
<p>The whole process is managed by a master job, which takes care of running
each subjob and accumulating the results.  You can run the master job on your
local workstation and submit the subjobs to a queue host that has one or more
GPUs, so that the subjobs can be run simultaneously, and each subjob can run 
in parallel.
</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Click the Job settings button.</p>
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/settings.png" />
<p>The <span class="GUI">FEP Mapper - Job Settings</span> dialog box opens.
</p></li>

<li><p>Change the job name to &quot;fep_tutorial&quot;. 
</p></li>

<li><p>For the master job, set the <span class="GUI">Maximum simultaneous
subjobs</span> to 0.</p>
<p>This value removes the limit on the number of subjobs, so all of the subjobs
are submitted to the subjob host.
</p></li>

<li><p>Choose a GPU host for the subjobs from the  <span class="GUI">Host</span>
option menu in the <span class="GUI">Subjob</span> section.</p>
<p>You should run the subjobs on a host with multiple GPUs to reduce the
turnaround time.
</p></li>

<li><p>Set the number of GPUs in the <span class="GUI">Total</span> text box in
the <span class="GUI">Subjob</span> section.</p>
<p> 
As there are 12 replicas, the number of GPUs should be a factor of 12, as the
replicas must be divided evenly between the GPUs.
</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Once you have set up the job parameters, you can either start the job, or you
can write out the input files and then start the job from the command line. 
</p>
<p><b>Important!</b> This job may run for many hours, so you should not start
the job from a laptop or any other machine that is likely to be disconnected
from the network while the job is running. At best, when the job finishes and
the machine is reconnected, the results will be immediately uploaded. As the
results can be several GB this may be highly undesirable. At worst, the results
might not be uploaded at all, and be lost. It is therefore recommended that you
copy the input files to your compute machine (cluster, for example), run it
there, and transfer the results back when it is convenient to you.  
</p>
<p><b>To run from the GUI:</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Click <span class="GUI">Run</span>.</p>
<p>The <span class="GUI">FEP Mapper - Job Settings</span> dialog box closes, and
the job is started.
</p></li>
</ul>

<p><b>To run from the command line:</b>
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Click <span class="GUI">OK</span> in the dialog box to save the job
settings.</p>
<p>The <span class="GUI">FEP Mapper - Job Settings</span> dialog box closes.
</p></li>

<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Write</span> from
the <span class="GUI">Settings</span> button menu. 
</p>
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/settings.png" />
<p>The job files are written to a subdirectory of the current directory, named
with the job name, and with the job name as the base name for the files. Six
files are written: one <code>.msj</code> file for the job, one for the
calculation in the complex, and one for the calculation in solvent;
a <span class="GUI">_pv.maegz</span> containing the structures,
a <code>.pkl</code> file that contains the perturbation map, and a shell script,
named <i>jobname</i><code>.sh</code>. 
</p></li>
<li><p>Run the shell script <i>jobname</i><code>.sh</code>.</p>
<p>If you copy the files to your cluster to run the job, you might have to
change some of the settings in the shell script, such as the names of the hosts.
</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Examining the Results</h3>
<p>When the job finishes, you can copy the results back to your local machine,
if you copied the results to a compute host. You should have the following files
and directories in the subdirectory that contained the input files: 
</p>
<p>
<i>jobname</i><tt>_*-out.tgz</tt><br/>
<i>jobname</i><tt>_out.pkl</tt><br/>
<i>jobname</i><tt>_out_pv.maegz</tt><br/>
<i>jobname</i><tt>_3</tt><br/>
</p>
<p>in addition to the log and checkpoint files.
</p>

<ol>
<li><p>In Maestro, choose  <span class="GUI">Applications &rarr; Desmond &rarr; FEP Mapper Analysis</span> or 
<span class="GUI">Tasks &rarr; Free Energy Calculations &rarr; FEP Mapper Analysis</span>.</p>
<p>The <span class="GUI">FEP Mapper Analysis</span> panel opens. 
</p></li>

<li><p>Click <span class="GUI">Browse</span>, and open the <code>_out.pkl</code>
file in the job subdirectory.</p>
<p>The panel tables are populated with results for each ligand, and the graph is
displayed. The <span class="GUI">Results</span> tab lists the experimental and
the predicted &Delta;G values, along with errors evaluated from the
calculations.  The <span class="GUI">Hysteresis</span> tab shows the sum of the
&Delta;&Delta;G values around each loop in the graph (the hysteresis), which
should ideally be zero. The <span class="GUI">Raw Data</span> tab gives the raw 
&Delta;&Delta;G values for each perturbation and estimates of their errors.
