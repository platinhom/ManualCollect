<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>In this panel you can scan a protein for residues that are candidates for
mutation, using homology modeling to identify variable or conserved residues,
solvent-accessible surface area to identify surface residues, distances to
identify contacts with other residues, surface shape complementarity, and manual
selection. The mutations can then be defined and applied to produce mutated
structures. Mutations are applied independently to produce a set of structures
with single mutations. This process can be repeated automatically to optimize
the stability of the protein or the affinity of two parts of the protein for
each other. 
</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Residue Scanning Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Residue Scanning</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Applications &rarr; BioLuminate &rarr; Residue Scanning / Affinity Maturation &rarr; Perform Calculations</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Tasks &rarr; Biologics &rarr; Residue Scanning / Affinity Maturation &rarr; Perform Calculations</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
</ul>


<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Residue Scanning Panel</h2> 


<p>The basic workflow is as follows:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Import a structure into the workflow, either from the Workspace or from a
Maestro file (<span class="GUI">Import structure from</span>).
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose the calculation type. Stability is always calculated, affinity can
be calculated if there is more than one chain. 
</p></li>
<li><p>If you chose to calculate affinity, select the chains for one of the
partners in the binding affinity calculation.
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose the mutations for the residues you want to mutate. </p>
<p>You can do this by clicking in the <span class="GUI">Mutations</span> column
of the table and selecting from the option menu that is displayed, or using
the <span class="GUI">Mutate ... to</span> tools to set mutations for multiple
residues simultaneously, or clicking the <span class="GUI">Homology
Criteria</span> button and selecting residues and their mutations by homology
modeling or structural criteria.
</p></li>
<li><p>If you want to optimize the stability or binding affinity, select 
<span class="GUI">Perform affinity maturation</span> in the 
<span class="GUI">Options</span> tab, and choose an optimization procedure.
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Job Settings</span> from the <span
class="GUI">Settings</span> button menu,</p>
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/settings.png" />
<p>set the job parameters in the <span class="GUI">Job Settings</span> dialog
box, and click <span class="GUI">Run</span> to run the job; or 
click <span class="GUI">Run</span> to run the job with the current job settings.
</p></li> 
</ol>

<p>A structure is produced for each mutation, and the structures
are incorporated into the project as new entries when the job finishes. As the
time taken scales linearly with the number of mutated structures produced, you
should consider carefully how many mutations you make. The number of mutation
sites and the total number of mutations (structures generated) is reported below
the table. 
</p>

<p>You can use suggestions from homology models for the residues to mutate,
based on variability or conservation at residue postions, or on solvent
accessibility or side-chain interactions. This is done by clicking 
<span class="GUI">Homology Criteria</span>, which opens the <span
class="GUI">Homology Suggestions</span> dialog box:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Run a search for homologs (<span class="GUI">Run a Blast Search</span>)
and align the homologs (<span class="GUI">Align Homologs</span>).
</p></li>
<li><p>Specify the criteria for automatic selection of residues, in the 
<span class="GUI">Selection by homology criteria</span> and <span
class="GUI">Parent structure 3D criteria</span> sections. 
</p></li>
<li><p>Click <span class="GUI">Select in the Residues Tab</span>.</p>
<p>The <span class="GUI">Residues</span> tab is displayed and the residues are
selected in the table. The default selection of mutations is based on the
variations seen in the homologs.
</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Residue scanning for antibodies can be done in the <span class="GUI">Antibody
Humanization: Residue Scanning</span> panel, which uses antibody databases
to search for homologs in the antibody itself. The <span class="GUI">Residue
Scanning</span> panel offers more general residue mutation capabilities, which
can be used for antibodies&mdash;for example, if you want to mutate both the
antibody and the antigen simultaneously.

<a name="feature1"></a>
<h3>Import tools</h3>
<p>The import tools allow you to import a protein structure into the workflow for
residue mutation. You can choose an option from the <span class="GUI">Import
structure from</span> option menu to use the entire structure in the Workspace,
the selected residues in the Workspace, or a structure from a Maestro file. For
the first two options, click the <span class="GUI">Import</span> button to
import and analyze the structure. If importing from a file, the button changes
to <span class="GUI">Browse</span>, and you can click this button to open a file
selector to locate and open the file.
</p>

<a name="feature2"></a>
<h3>Calculation type options</h3>
<p>These options allow you to choose between calculating the protein
stability as a result of mutation <span class="GUI">(Stability</span>), or to
calculate both the stability and the affinity of one part of the protein for
another (<span class="GUI">Stability and Affinity</span>). If you select the
latter option, the <span class="GUI">Binding partners</span> tools are displayed
so you can define the two parts of the protein.
</p>

<a name="binding_partners"></a>
<h3>Binding partners option menu</h3>
<p>Choose the chains to use for one of the two binding partners for affinity
calculations from this option menu. The remaining chains are assigned to the
other partner. These tools are only available if you choose 
<span class="GUI">Stability and Affinity</span> for the calculation type.
</p>


<a name="suggestions"></a>
<h3>Homology Criteria button</h3>
<p>Select residues to mutate based on suggestions from homologous
proteins. When you click this button, the 
<a href="residue_scanning_homology_suggestions.html"><span class="GUI">Homology
Suggestions</span> dialog box</a> opens, in which you can build a homology model
for a chain and select residues by conservation or structural criteria. Clicking
<span class="GUI">Save</span> in this dialog box selects the suggested residues
in the residue table of the <span class="GUI">Residues</span> tab and sets the
mutations for the residue to the residues in the homologs that differ from the
query.
</p>

<a name="residues"></a>
<h3>Residues tab</h3>
<p>In this tab you select the residues for mutation.

scalar product of the normal to one surface at each surface point and the normal
to the other surface at the point nearest to the first surface, with a weighting 
factor for the distance between the points. The score is the normalized sum over
surface points, such that perfect complementarity (parallel normals) has a value
of 1, and no complementarity has a value of 0. It is evaluated over the buried
solvent-accessible surface area. (See Lawrence, M. C.; Colman, P. M. <i>J. Mol.
