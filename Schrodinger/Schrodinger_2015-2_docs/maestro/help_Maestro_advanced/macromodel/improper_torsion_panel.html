<h2>Opening the Force Field Viewer's Improper Torsion Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Force Field Viewer's Improper Torsion</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Click <span class="GUI">Improper Torsion</span> in the 
<span class="GUI">Force Field Viewer</span> panel.</p></li>
</ul>


<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Force Field Viewer's Improper Torsion Panel</h2> 


<p>The Improper Torsions List, located on the left side of the <span
class="GUI">Improper Torsion</span> panel displays all the improper torsion
interactions present the selected <code>.mmo</code> file in the order they were
read from the file. To select a particular torsion, highlight it in the list by
clicking on it with the left mouse button, or pick the atoms defining it from
the Workspace structure.  The text boxes on the panel will update to display
data relevant to the selected torsion. </p>

<dt>Improper Torsions List:</dt>
<dd><p>All of the improper torsions in a given .mmo file are displayed in the
Improper Torsions List located on the left side of the "Improper Torsion" panel. The
text box in which the list appears is a read-only field. </p></dd>

<a name="feature2"></a>
<dt>Find by Picking:</dt>
<dd><p>To locate a particular torsion in the list, enable the "Find by
Picking"
toggle button and click on the four atoms in the structure that define the
torsion. Once the fourth atom has been picked (and assuming an entry for
the atom set can be found), the torsion corresponding to those four atoms
will be selected in the list. </p></dd>

<a name="feature3"></a>
<dt>Sort by Energy:</dt>
<dd><p>By default, the torsions that are displayed in the list appear in the
order they were read from the .mmo file. However, the list may be sorted
according to energy by enabling the "Sort By Energy" toggle button. The
torsion with the lowest (i.e. most negative) energy will then be displayed
at the beginning of the list and the one with the highest energy (i.e. most
positive) will be displayed at the end. </p></dd>

<a name="feature4"></a>
<dt>Show:</dt>
<dd><p>When Maestro first reads an .mmo file, all of the torsion interactions
are
displayed on the "Improper Torsion" panel. To limit the displayed torsions
based on quality, select the "High Quality," "Medium Quality," or "Low
Quality" menu option from the "Show:" menu. Limiting the display to only
the low quality parameters is a useful way to identify those that might
be generalized or that might not be suitable for calculations in which a
high degree of accuracy is desired. Clicking on the "All Parameters"
option redisplays all torsions. </p></dd>

<a name="feature5"></a>
<dt>Show Force Field:</dt>
<dd><p>Clicking on the "Show Force Field" button opens the "FField" panel,
which displays the .mmo file in its entirety. When the panel is opened, a
text line will be selected. The selected line corresponds to the
torsion that is currently selected in the Improper Torsion List. </p></dd>

<a name="feature6"></a>
<dt>Improper Torsion Energy:</dt>
<dd><p>Improper torsions are defined by four atoms, of which only three are
bound
sequentially. Take, for example, a T-shaped molecule defined by three
atoms in sequence and a fourth atom that is attached to only the second.
The molecular geometry around the second atom, as viewed down the 4-2 bond
(e.g. planar or bent) would fall under the category of an improper
torsion. The torsion energy, which appears in the "Improper Torsion Energy:" text
box is the value obtained from a calculations involving the torsion angle
and various torsion parameters (V1, V2, V3, etc.). </p></dd>

<a name="feature7"></a>
<dt>V1:</dt>
<dd><p>This is the standard V1 torsional parameter, which is used to
calculate
the energy for a particular improper torsion at 0 degrees, relative to
that at 180. The y parameter is useful in defining such energy
differences y as that between cis and trans conformations. </p></dd>

<a name="feature8"></a>
<dt>V2 and V3:</dt>
<dd><p>These are the standard V2 and V3 torsional parameters. </p></dd>

<a name="feature9"></a>
<dt>Origin:</dt>
<dd><p>The "Origin:" setting is meant to provide users with information
regarding
the actual parameter evaluation method used in the current calculation.
The possible entries in this field include "Original," "Modified
Parameter," and "Additional Parameter." "Original" means that the force
field used was in its native state, as published by the original author.
"Modified" implies that MacroModel used a version with parameters that have
been revised based on work by the MacroModel research group or subsequent
publications. Finally, the "Additional Parameter" message indicates that
MacroModel's force field treatment of this particular item involves at least
one parameter that was absent from the native force field. For more
information about which parameters have been modified or added, see the
help topic on a specific field in the list of related topics below. Also,
the source of the modifications/additions is listed on the first line of
each .mmo file. </p></dd>

<a name="feature10"></a>
<dt>Alternate:</dt>
<dd><p>For some force fields, it is possible for users to customize
particular
parameters. For instance, in the AMBER* field, either the
Senderowitz-Parish-Still or the Homans carbohydrate parameters can be
chosen. To select a treatment different than the default, you must edit
the force field file. The "Alternate:" text field in the "Force Field
Viewer" panels is meant only to notify you which, if any, modifications
were made to the force field before the calculation in the currently
selected file was performed. </p></dd>

<a name="feature11"></a>
<dt>Comment:</dt>
<dd><p>The text in this field is a description of the atom and bond
configuration
for the torsion that is currently selected in the Improper Torsion
List. </p></dd>

<a name="feature12"></a>
<dt>Angle:</dt>
<dd><p>There is no "ideal" angle for a torsion. The number in this field
displays the torsion angle that corresponds to the particular energy value
calculated using the "V" parameters and shown in the "Improper Torsion Energy:" text
box. </p></dd>

<a name="feature13"></a>
<dt>Quality:</dt>
<dd><p>The designation that appears in this field refers to the confidence
level
for the currently selected measurement. Calculations using the original
force field parameters, or parameters that have otherwise been extensively
researched, are given "High Quality" ratings. Calculations that include
less certain parameters are given "Medium Quality" ratings. Calculations
using parameters that are applied generically, without consideration of
individual bonding situations, are given "Low Quality" designations. Those
parameters that are given "Low Quality" ratings may not be acceptable in
calculations that require high accuracy.</p>
<p>
The "Quality" rating system is meant to be used only as a guide. Ratings
are somewhat relative. For instance, a parameter designated as "medium"
quality for a high-accuracy force field like MMFF might still produce
more reliable results than a "high" quality parameter in the MM2* field.
Please note that it is still possible to obtain inaccurate results from a
parameter with a "High Quality" rating. </p></dd>
