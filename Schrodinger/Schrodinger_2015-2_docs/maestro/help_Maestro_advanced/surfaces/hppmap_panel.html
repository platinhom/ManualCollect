<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>The <span class="GUI">Hydrophobic/philic Surfaces</span> panel is used to
generate hydrophobic and hydrophilic surface maps for a structure. </p>

<p>The generation of the Hydrophobic/philic surface requires the definition of a
<a href="#features4">Bounding Box</a> within which values to be used for
surface interpolation are to be computed. This is done by selecting a set
of atoms, together with a "buffer distance" (
<a href="#features4">Bounding Box</a>); the grid will be computed within
the minimal enclosing box (following the coordinate axes) and extended
out past each face the distance of the buffer (bounding box).</p>

<p>The surface generation is run as a job. Later, when the job has finished, you
can <a href="../misc/monitor_panel.html">monitor</a> the job to see the
results.</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Hydrophobic/philic Surfaces Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Hydrophobic/philic Surfaces</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Workspace &rarr; Surface &rarr; Hydrophobic/philic</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
</ul>


<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Hydrophobic/philic Surfaces Panel</h2> 


<p>To create hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces, you first need to import the
receptor and a docked ligand and display them in the Workspace. Next, open the
<span class="GUI">Hydrophobic/philic Surfaces panel</span>. Pick an atom in the
receptor to define the <span class="GUI">Part of structure to map</span>, then
in the <span class="GUI">Bounding box</span> section, select an object from the
<span class="GUI">Pick</span> menu and pick an atom in the ligand. An
orange-colored box is placed around the ligand. Click <span
class="GUI">Run</span> to run the job.</p>

<p>The job should take a few minutes. When it is finished, the grids are
automatically incorporated into your Maestro session and the hydrophilic and
hydrophobic maps appear in the Workspace, contoured at the default values of
&minus;6 and &minus;0.5 kcal/mol, respectively, and colored turquoise and
orange. You can use the <span class="GUI">Surfaces</span> panel to change these
attributes, and should use it to increase the transparency from the default
setting of 0 ("opaque", which means that you won't be able to see any ligand
atoms that lie within contoured regions) to ~50. You may find it more helpful to
change the surface type to <span class="GUI">Mesh</span>; this is the
representation used in the J. Med. Chem. article cited above. </p>

<p>You may also need to change the hydrophilic and/or hydrophobic isosurface
contour defaults of &minus;6 and &minus;0.5 kcal/mol. It stands to reason that a
given location in the active site cannot be both hydrophilic and hydrophobic.
Thus, the hydrophilic and hydrophobic maps should not interpenetrate, but rather
should be separated by some "neither" space. This normally happens, but we are
aware of at least one case in which some interpenetration occurs when the
default isosurface values are used.  You may need to change the isosurface
values manually, possibly by setting the hydrophobic value to &minus;0.6 or
&minus;0.7 kcal/mol. You can also make the hydrophilic value more negative than
&minus;6 kcal/mol, but should not make the definition so restrictive that
important hydrogen-bonding regions are missed. </p>

<h2>Hydrophobic/philic Surfaces Background/Description</h2>

<p>The Hydrophobic/philic map tool is a 3D graphics tool that is designed to
assist in visualizing preferred locations of ligand atoms in a receptor site.
Given a receptor structure, the accessible space in the
active site is partitioned into three types of regions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hydrophobic: regions that are favorable for occupancy by hydrophobic
ligand groups </li>
<li>Hydrophilic: regions that are favorable for occupancy by hydrophilic
ligand groups</li>
<li>Neither hydrophobic nor hydrophilic: regions that are of mixed
character or that are far enough from the receptor surface to be similar
to bulk water, where to a first approximation any type of group could
reside with little effect on the binding affinity. </li>
</ul>

<p>Hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions are marked by surface contours that
enclose the region in question. The "neither" regions, in contrast,
are implicit; these are simply regions that are accessible to the ligand
but are not marked as being either hydrophobic or hydrophilic.</p>

<p>By revealing "targets of opportunity" - e.g., hydrophobic regions that
have room to accommodate a larger hydrophobic group - active site maps
can aid in the design of new ligands. Alternatively, by showing the
degree to which poses produced by a program like Glide display -or
violate - proper complementarity to the receptor site, site maps can
aid in the evaluation of docking hits. The "neither" regions are
also important because they are regions in which the physical properties
of the ligand can be changed - for example, to make the ligand more or
less soluble - with minimal expected effect on the binding affinity. </p>

<p>The active-site mapping procedure operates in a manner analogous to
Goodford's GRID algorithm (P. Goodford, J. Med. Chem. 1985, 28, 849).
"Hydrophilic" and "hydrophobic" regions are defined in
a way that considers both spatial proximity to the receptor and
suitability for occupancy by solvent water. A putative van der
Waals energy and the magnitude and direction of the electric field
(calculated using a distance-dependent dielectric formulation) are
computed for a probe centered at each grid point by considering
interactions with all atoms of the receptor site within a defined
cutoff distance. In contrast to techniques that color-code the
receptor surface to represent hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity,
site maps depend on more than the character of the nearest receptor
atom. Moreover, site maps explicitly show the shape and extent of
hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions, something a receptor-surface display
cannot do. The site maps behave rather like an "extraradius" surface
in that the atoms of a stick figure representation of the ligand can
approach but should not penetrate the site map surface (except in
hydrogen bonding regions, where internuclear distances are expected
to be smaller than normal contact vdW distances).</p>

<p>Hydrophilic Map: a measure of "hydrophilicity" is constructed by
adding an "electric-field reward" term to the vdW energy (Equation 1): </p>

<pre>
Grid_philic = vdW_energy + oriented-dipole_energy (1)
</pre>

<p>where the oriented-dipole energy is necessarily negative. Hydrophilic
regions then are those within which the sum of the two terms is sufficiently
negative, and are revealed by contouring the "hydrophilic grid" at a
prescribed negative isosurface value, typically -6 kcal/mol. </p>

<p>Hydrophobic Map: Conversely, the quantity representing "hydrophobicity"
is constructed by adding an oppositely signed (positive) "electric-field
penalty" term to the vdW term (Equation 2):</p>
<pre>
Grid_phobic = vdW_energy &minus; 0.15 oriented-dipole_energy (2)
</pre>

<p>Hydrophobic regions thus are taken to be those for which the favorable vdW
term is not too strongly degraded by the positive electric-field penalty.
Qualitatively, therefore, hydrophobic regions are those that lie suitably
close to the surface of the receptor but for which the water-dipole-orienting
electric field produced by the receptor is sufficiently small. In short,
these are regions where something would like to be, but water would not.
Hydrophobic regions are revealed by contouring the associated grid at a
suitably negative threshold, e.g., &minus;0.5 kcal/mol. The hydrophobic regions
for human renin defined in this way are illustrated in the stereo pair shown
in Figure 3 of Weber, Halgren, et al., J. Med. Chem. 1991, 34, 2692-2701.</p>

<p>Method: The first step in computing grids is to define a rectilinear box that
contains an active site and to define grid points with a typical grid spacing of
1 &Aring; within the box. Next, van der Waals energies and x, y, z electrostatic
field components are computed at each of the grid points.  Receptor atom partial
charges and van der Waals parameters are taken from the OPLS-AA force field. A
probe is represented by a van der Waals sphere of radius 1.5 &Aring; and well
depth 0.2 kcal/mol, and has a point dipole moment of 2.3 debye. The probe's
point dipole is oriented along the electric field to give a minimum (negative)
electrostatic energy and is offset from the vdW body (which is located at the
grid point and represents the oxygen atom of a water molecule) toward the center
of an optimally oriented O&ndash;H bond. A smoothing procedure is applied during
the calculation of the receptor's electric field to avoid artificial
singularities. The "hydrophilic" and "hydrophobic" grid values are then
determined from Equations 1 and 2. Finally, the hydrophilic and hydrophobic
grids are read by Maestro, which contours the grids at the empirically selected
default isosurface values cited above (&minus;6 and &minus;0.5 kcal/mol) and
displays the corresponding hydrophilic and hydrophobic volumes as
solid/translucent or wire-frame surfaces.  These values can be changed in the
Maestro Surfaces panel if more expansive or more restrictive hydrophilic and
hydrophobic volumes are judged to be appropriate in a given application. Because
you need to see inside these surfaces, you may find that the hydrophilic and
hydrophobic volumes are easier to visualize if you display them as mesh
surfaces. If you display them as solid surfaces (the default in Maestro 5), you
will need to increase the transparency by moving the <span
class="GUI">Transparency</span> slider about half way to the right.</p>
