<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
The <span class="GUI">Generate Conformers</span> dialog box
generates conformers for each structure in the ligand list.
The conformers are generated using a rapid torsional search, which can be
followed by a minimization.</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Generate Conformers Dialog Box</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Generate Conformers</span> dialog box, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Click <span class="GUI">Generate Conformers</span> in the 
<span class="GUI">Prepare Ligands</span> step of the <span class="GUI">Develop Common Pharmacophore Hypotheses</span> panel.</p></li>
</ul>


<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Generate Conformers Dialog Box</h2> 


<p>
For the development of a pharmacophore model, it is important to generate a
range of conformations for each ligand.</p> 

<p>Once the conformers are generated, you have several options for selecting
conformers. The energy of the conformers is evaluated in aqueous solution (with
a continuum solvation model), and you can eliminate conformers based on their
relative energy. If there is a large number of conformers for a given ligand,
you can set a maximum number of conformers to retain. The set of generated
conformers is sampled to enforce the limit. </p>

<p>Some options have a greater impact than others on the outcome of
pharmacophore model development. Options with the greatest impact include the
maximum number of conformations, maximum relative energy difference, minimum
atomic deviation and number of post-minimization iterations. The default
settings (rapid search, distance-dependent dielectric solvation model, and no
post-minimization iterations) are likely to be adequate for many
purposes.</p>

<p>When you have made all the settings, click <span class="GUI">Start</span>.
The <span class="GUI">Start</span> dialog box opens, in which you can choose a
host to run the job, specify the number of subjobs (which should not be greater
than the number of ligands), and specify the number of processors to use.
Clicking <span class="GUI">Start</span> in this dialog box then starts the job.
</p>

<h2>Generate Conformers Dialog Box Features</h2> 


<p>For database searching, only a selection of features are available for
as-needed conformer generation. Unavailable features are noted below. </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#feature1">Current conformers options</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature3">Limits on numbers of conformers</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature4"><span class="GUI">MacroModel search
method</span> option menu and related options</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature7"><span class="GUI">Amide bonds</span> option menu</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature5"><span class="GUI">Preprocess</span> and
<span class="GUI">Postprocess</span> options and text boxes</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature6"><span class="GUI">MacroModel options</span> section</a></li>
</ul>


<a name="feature1"></a>
<h3>Current conformers Options</h3>

<p>When you generate conformers, you can discard the current conformer set or you
can keep it. If you keep the existing set, the new conformers are appended to
the set. The set might therefore contain redundant conformers, but it will
contain the original structure.</p>

<a name="feature3"></a>
<h3>Limits on Numbers of Conformers</h3>

<p>Two text boxes provide limits on the number of conformers generated. The
limit actually used is the minimum of the two limits. 
</p>

<dl>
<dt><span class="GUI">Number of conformers per rotatable bond</span> text
box</dt> 
<dd><p>This text box specifies the maximum number of conformers to generate in
the conformational search for each rotatable bond in the structure. The
number given in the text box is multiplied by the number of rotatable bonds in
the molecule to arrive at the maximum number of conformers.  The default for
this value is 10.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Maximum number of conformers per structure</span> text
box</dt> 
<dd><p>This value limits the number of conformers returned from the generation
process. If the number of conformers generated is higher than this value,
a sample of all the conformers generated is returned. The default is 100. 
</p></dd>

</dl>

<a name="feature4"></a>
<h3>MacroModel Search Method Option Menu and Related Options</h3>

<p>The <span class="GUI">MacroModel search method</span> option menu supplies
two choices. Each choice has a separate set of controls, which are displayed
below the option menu.</p>
<dl>
<dt><span class="GUI">ConfGen</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>In this method, the ligand is divided into a core and a periphery. The
peripheral groups have only one rotatable bond between the terminal groups and
the rest of the molecule. All the nonperipheral rotatable bonds are assigned to
the core. The conformational search generates all core configurations and then
varies the peripheral configurations, either one-by-one or in a complete
search. During the search, hydrogen-bonding interactions are suppressed, because
conformations in which the ligand bonds to the receptor are needed in the model,
not just conformations with internal hydrogen bonding. </p>

<p>The extent of the search depends on the sampling method as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Rapid</span>:
All the core conformations are generated, and the conformations
of the peripheral (rotamer) groups are sampled one by one.
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Thorough</span>:
A complete set of conformations is generated for both the core and the
peripheral groups.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When you choose this option, the <span class="GUI">Amide bonds</span> option
menu and the <span class="GUI">Preprocess</span> and 
<span class="GUI">Postprocess</span> options and associated controls are
displayed below the <span class="GUI">MacroModel search method</span> option
menu.</p>

<a name="feature7"></a>
<p>There are three options for treatment of amide bonds in the search:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="GUI">Vary conformation</span>&mdash;This option
allows the amide dihedral angle to be varied. It can take any value, not just
cis or trans.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Retain original conformation</span>&mdash;Retain the
conformation that was in the input structure.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Set to trans conformation</span>&mdash;Set the
conformation to trans for all amide bonds. </li>
</ul>

<p>Experience to date suggests that the final pharmacophore model is not usually
significantly improved by a thorough search. </p>

<a name="feature5"></a>
<p>The <span class="GUI">Preprocess</span> and <span
class="GUI">Postprocess</span> options perform other MacroModel tasks, including
an optional minimization. Preprocessing is
done on the input structure; postprocessing is done on the set of conformers
generated by the conformational search. The same set of minimization options,
from the <span class="GUI">MacroModel options</span> section, are 
used in both cases.</p>

<p>Three options are available for postprocessing:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="GUI">Minimize, then eliminate high-energy and redundant
conformers</span>&mdash;Minimize the conformers after 
eliminating high-energy and redundant conformers. This option has a dependent
<span class="GUI">Steps</span> text box, in which you can enter the number of
minimization steps. This is the most expensive option.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Eliminate high-energy and redundant
conformers</span>&mdash;Eliminate redundant conformers, evaluate the energy and
eliminate any conformers that exceed the 
energy threshold given in the <span class="GUI">Macromodel options</span>
section.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Eliminate redundant conformers</span>&mdash;Perform only
the redundant conformer elimination step. This is the least expensive option,
as it does not require any energy evaluation. It is only available if 
<span class="GUI">Preprocess</span> is deselected.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Mixed MCMM/LMOD</span></dt>
<dd><p>This method is a combined Monte-Carlo Multiple Minimum/Low Mode
search, and is more accurate than the torsional sampling (ConfGen) method, but
as a consequence takes longer. The difference between 
<span class="GUI">Rapid</span> and <span class="GUI">Thorough</span> sampling is
in the number of steps taken per rotatable bond, which is much larger for
thorough sampling. For more information on this method, see <a
href="../../../macromodel/macromodel_user_manual.pdf" 
target="pdfmanuals">Chapter 10</a> of the <i>Macromodel User Manual</i>.
</p>
<p>When you choose this option, the <span class="GUI">Minimization steps</span>
text box is displayed. Minimization of the conformers generated by a mixed
MCMM/LMOD search is recommended. The conformer set includes the input structure.

<dt><span class="GUI">Solvation treatment</span> options</dt>
<dd><p>Two continuum solvation treatments for water are provided.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="GUI">Distance-dependent dielectric</span></li>
<li><span class="GUI">GB/SA water</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The distance-dependent dielectric model is somewhat faster that the GB/SA
model, and usually produces similar results. For details, see
<a href="../macromodel/potential_tab.html">MacroModel &mdash; Potential Tab</a>
and <a href="../../../macromodel/macromodel_user_manual.pdf"
target="pdfmanuals">Chapter 4</a> of the <i>MacroModel User Manual</i>.</p>

<p>Solvation treatments are not available for as-needed conformer
generation during database searching.</p>
</dd>

<a name="feature6.3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Maximum relative energy difference</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>This value sets an energy threshold relative to the lowest-energy
conformer. Conformers that are higher in energy than this threshold are
discarded. The energy is evaluated with MacroModel using the selected force
field, or with an energy estimate if MacroModel processing is not used.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature6.4"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Eliminate redundant conformers using</span> options and
text boxes</dt> 
<dd><p>Two cutoff criteria are available for eliminating redundant
conformers:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Maximum atom deviation</span>&mdash;
All distances between pairs of corresponding heavy atoms must be below this
cutoff for two conformers to be considered identical.  This cutoff is only
applied after the energy difference threshold, and only if the two conformers are
within 1 kcal/mol of each other.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">RMSD</span>&mdash;The root-mean-square deviation of all
pairs of corresponding heavy atoms must be below this
cutoff for two conformers to be considered identical. </p></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the threshold, a threshold of 60 degrees is used for torsion
angle differences for polar hydrogens. This threshold cannot be changed.
</p>
<p>The threshold is not used in as-needed conformer generation during database
searching.</p>
