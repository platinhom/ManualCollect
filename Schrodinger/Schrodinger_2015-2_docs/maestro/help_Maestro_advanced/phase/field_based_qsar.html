<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>In this panel you can set up a field-based QSAR model (CoMFA/CoMSIA)
from a set of aligned ligands, and use the model to predict activities for other
molecules. You can also visualize the QSAR model in the Workspace and create a
scatter plot of the activities.
</p>
<p>For background information, see 
<a href="field_based_qsar_background.html">Field-Based QSAR Background</a>.</p>


<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Field-Based QSAR Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Field-Based QSAR</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Applications &rarr; Field-Based QSAR</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
</ul>


<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Field-Based QSAR Panel</h2> 


<p>To generate a QSAR model, you must first ensure that the ligands are
aligned. If the ligands were exported from the Develop Common Pharmacophore
Hypotheses procedure, they should already be prealigned to the pharmacophore
model.  You can use the Phase command-line tool <code>pharm_align_mol</code> to
align ligands to a hypothesis. In Maestro, you can use the <span
class="GUI">Superposition</span> panel (<span class="GUI">Tools &rarr;
Superposition</span>) to align the ligands. The best choice is probably to align
by a SMARTS pattern for the ligand core.

<h3>Toolbar</h3>
<p>The toolbar has two buttons, for controlling what is displayed in the
Workspace for the model. The choice of fields and parameters can be made in the
<a href="field_qsar_vis_settings.html"><span class="GUI">Field-Based QSAR
Visualization Settings</span> panel<span class="GUI">Field-Based QSAR
Visualization Settings</span> panel</a>, which you open by clicking <span
class="GUI">QSAR Visualization</span>. The buttons are not available until a
model has been built.
</p>
<table border=0 cellpadding=5>
<tr>

<td><span class="GUI">View Contours</span><br />
Display surfaces in the Workspace for each field that are contoured at a
particular value ("isovalue") of the field. By default, the first field in the
list in the <a href="field_qsar_vis_settings.html"><span class="GUI">Field-Based
QSAR Visualization Settings</span> panel</a> is displayed.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/phase_view_intensities.png" /></td>

</td>
</tr>

<a name="feature2"></a>
<h3>Add ligands buttons</h3>
<p>These buttons allow you to add ligands to the ligands table.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="GUI">From Project</span>&mdash;Opens the 
<a href="add_from_project_db.html"><span class="GUI">Add From Project</span>
dialog box</a>, in which you can choose a set of entries, select an activity
property, and assign training and test set memberships based on a property
value.
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">From File</span>&mdash;Opens a file selector, in which
you can navigate to and select the file. When you click <span
class="GUI">OK</span>, the <a href="choose_activity_property_db.html"><span
class="GUI">Choose Activity Property</span> dialog box</a> opens, in which you
can select an activity property, converting it into the appropriate units if
need be, and select a QSAR set property, to define the members of the training
set and the test set by a value of this property.
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The ligands you add must be fully prepared 3D structures that are properly
aligned. No facility is provided in this panel for preparing the structures or
aligning the ligands.
</p>

<a name="feature3b"></a>
<h3>Delete and Delete All buttons</h3>
<p>These buttons allow you to delete ligands from the ligands table. 
The <span class="GUI">Delete</span> button deletes the selected ligands from the
table. This allows you to change a model by removing ligands, or replacing
ligands, for example. The <span class="GUI">Delete All</span> button removes all
ligands from the table. This is useful if you want to create a model with a
different set of ligands. 
</p>

<a name="feature3"></a>
<h3>Ligands table</h3>

<p>This table contains the list of ligands. When the ligands are first read, all
ligands are included in the training set, and the <span class="GUI">#
Factors</span>, <span class="GUI">Predicted Activity</span> and <span
class="GUI">Prediction Error</span>columns are empty. These columns are added
after the QSAR model is built. The table columns are described below.
</p>

<p>Most of the columns of this table are noneditable. You can change the activity
values, select the training and test sets, and display the ligands in the
Workspace. You can sort the table by the values in a column, by clicking the
column heading. Use shift-click and control-click to select multiple rows. 
</p>

<table cellpadding=5>
<tr>
<td style="padding-right: 10px;"><span class="GUI">In</span></td>
<td>Inclusion status of the ligand. The diamond has a cross in it if the ligand
is included in the Workspace, and is empty if the ligand is excluded. You can
include and exclude ligands with click, shift-click and control-click.
</td>

<td>Indicates whether a ligand is in the training set, the test set, or neither
(the ligand is ignored). The column is blank if the ligand is ignored. Click the
column repeatedly to cycle the ligand through the three possible
states. Control-click to cycle the selected ligands through the three
states. The state for the selected ligands is set to the state for the row that
is clicked. </td>
</tr>

specified in the <a href="build_qsar_model_options.html"><span class="GUI">Build
Model</span> dialog box</a>.
Each row contains the prediction from a model containing the number of PLS
factors indicated in the <span class="GUI"># Factors</span> column. </td>

<h3>Field fractions table</h3>
<p>Display the fraction of each field in the QSAR model for each number of PLS
factors used in the model. This information can give you a general idea of the
overall relative impact of each field type on activity. For example, if steric
and hydrophobic Gaussian field fractions are much larger than the other types
(as is often the case), that suggests that most of the binding energy is coming
from hydrophobic interactions.
</p>


<a name="feature7"></a>

available.

file, for example <code>mymodel.qsar</code>. The ligands are written to a
Maestro file, which for the example given would be
<code>mymodel_qsar_pred.mae</code>.
