<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Liaison is a method of predicting ligand-protein binding free
energies using a model that has been fitted to known binding
energy values. The process involves two steps, a fitting
step and a predicting step. Each step is carried out as two
tasks, a simulation task and an analysis task.
The <span class="GUI">Liaison</span> panel is used
to set up and run the simulation tasks. The analysis tasks
are performed using the <a href="../strike/strike_build.html">
<span class="GUI">Build QSAR Model</span> panel</a>
of Strike.</p>

<p>For background information on Liaison, see the
<a href="liaison_background.html">Liaison Background</a> topic.</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Liaison Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Liaison</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Applications &rarr; Liaison</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
</ul>


<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Liaison Panel</h2> 


<p>Before you run a Liaison simulation, you should ensure that the receptor and
the ligands are properly prepared. You should also ensure that the ligand
structure file includes the known binding energies.</p>

<p><b>To run a Liaison simulation:</b></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Specify the systems to be simulated in the
<span class="GUI">Systems</span> tab. The receptor is taken from the Workspace. 
You can take the ligands from the Project Table or a file.
</p></li>
<li><p>Set constraints on the protein if required under
<span class="GUI">Set protein flexibility</span> in the
<span class="GUI">Systems</span> tab.
</p></li>
<li><p>Specify the kind of simulation in the <span class="GUI">Parameters</span>
tab.
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Job Settings</span> from the <span
class="GUI">Settings</span> button menu.</p>
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/settings.png" />
<p>The <span class="GUI">Job Settings</span> dialog box opens.
</p></li>
<li><p>Set the job name and select the host and number of processors.</p>
<p>If you want to choose a remote machine or batch queue
as the host for the job, ensure that the current working directory
is mounted on the remote host. Liaison input files are
written to the current working directory. Liaison does
not have the ability to copy input files from a local directory
to a remote scratch directory.
</p></li>
<li><p>Click <span class="GUI">Run</span>.
</p></li>
</ol>
<p>When the job finishes, the results are incorporated into the Project Table.
The scores and the various components that are used in the analysis task
are added as properties. If the job does not incorporate, select it in the
<span class="GUI">Monitor</span> panel and click
<span class="GUI">Monitor</span>.
</p>

<p><b>To run a Liaison fitting job:</b></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Select the results of a Liaison simulation:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the simulation results are already in the Project Table, select the
relevant entries, and choose <span class="GUI">Build QSAR Model</span>
from the <span class="GUI">Strike</span> submenu of the
<span class="GUI">Applications</span> menu.
</p>
<p>If the simulation results include both the training set and the test set,
you should select the training set for the fitting.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If the simulation results are not incorporated, click
<span class="GUI">Browse</span> in the
<span class="GUI">Analysis</span> tab, navigate to and select the file
<i>jobname</i><tt>-final.mae</tt>, and click
<span class="GUI">Fit or Predict in Strike</span>
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The <span class="GUI">Build QSAR Model</span> panel of
Strike opens, with the Liaison results loaded.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Select the descriptors required for the fit from the list
(click, shift-click, control-click).</p>
<p>For an LRM model, select <span class="GUI">Uvdw</span>,
<span class="GUI">Uele</span>, and <span class="GUI">Ucav</span>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Multiple Linear Regression</span>
from the <span class="GUI">Regression method</span> option menu.
</p></li>
<li><p>For <span class="GUI">Descriptors</span>, ensure that
<span class="GUI">Use all selected</span> is selected.
</p></li>
<li><p>Click <span class="GUI">Choose</span> to choose the activity
property. </p>
<p>If the activity property is not in the Project Table, you can import it from a
CSV file, but you must do this before clicking
<span class="GUI">Choose</span>.
</p></li>
<li><p>Click <span class="GUI">Run</span>.
</p></li>
</ol>

<p><b>To run a Liaison prediction job:</b></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Select the results of a Liaison simulation for the test set (the ligands
whose binding energy you want to predict) in the Project Table</p></li>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Predict</span>
from the <span class="GUI">Strike</span> submenu of the
<span class="GUI">Applications</span> menu.
</p></li>
<li><p>Select the model you want to apply from the list.
</p></li>
<li><p>Click <span class="GUI">Run</span>.
</p></li>
</ol>
<p>When the job finishes, you can view the results by clicking
