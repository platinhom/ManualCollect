<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Build a polymer from one or more monomer units. The polymer can be linear,
branched, or dendritic; with different monomers it can also be a periodic or
block copolymer or a random copolymer. You can specify the composition,
arrangement and configuration of the monomers; the initiator, cascader (if
any), and terminator; backbone dihedrals and nonstandard couplings.</p> 

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Polymer Builder Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Polymer Builder</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Tools &rarr; Build Polymer</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Applications &rarr; Materials Science &rarr; Build Polymer</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>

<h2>Using the Polymer Builder Panel</h2> 


<p>This panel can be used to build a variety of polymers that are linear,
branched, or dendritic; any of these can be periodic, block, or random
copolymers, and nonstandard couplings can be introduced with given
probabilities. The tacticity of the polymer units can be specified if the
monomer unit is chiral, and the dihedral between the monomer units can be
set.</p>
<p>You can also create several polymers of different composition by varying
the monomer at different points in the repeat unit. Each version of the repeat
unit is used to build a separate polymer. The variation is done by using *
instead of the letter symbol for the monomer, when defining the repeat unit in
a copolymer.</p> 
<p>Building the polymer is relatively quick so it is done in real time. 
Note that no checking is done for steric clashes, and no minimization is
performed on the polymer structure. Polymers are added to the Maestro project as
entries, and you can set the coloring and molecular representation for different
parts of the polymer as part of the process. 
</p>
<p>A central part of the task is to choose or create the initiator, monomers,
terminator, and for denritic polymers, the cascader. Several common groups are
supplied, but otherwise you can create your own by sketching these groups in
2D (they are automatically converted to 3D). As well as sketching the groups,
you must label the points at which these groups are attached to the other groups
in the polymer. Instructions for sketching and labeling groups are given below. 
</p>

<p>As well as building a single polymer chain or dendrimer, you can create an
amorphous cubic cell consisting of multiple polymer chains. The cell may have a
nonuniform composition of the polymers if you chose any random element in the
generation of the polymer chain. The cell is built by randomly orienting and
placing polymers one by one, and checking for clashes. If a clash is found, the
latest polymer to be placed is placed again at random, and this process is
repeated until a non-clashing placement is found or the number of tries is
exceeded. If a non-clashing placement isn't found, building of the cell is tried
again from the beginning. If the cell can't be built from the beginning after a
specified number of trials, the density or the scaling factor for clash
detection is decreased, and the process starts again. You can choose to create a
model system for Desmond MD simulations instead of just a structure. The
structure or the model system is incorporated into the project. 
</p>

<p><b>To sketch an initiator, cascader, terminator, or monomer group:</b></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Click <span class="GUI">Sketch</span>.</p>
<p>The <span class="GUI">Sketcher</span> panel for the group type opens.
</p></li>
<li><p>Draw the group as it appears in the polymer using the drawing tools.</p>
<p>This means that monomers should not have double bonds as they exist in the
isolated monomer, but single bonds as they exist in the polymer. See the 
<a href="../edit_menu/2d_sketcher.html">2D Workspace Panel</a> topic for details
on how to use the drawing tools.
</p></li>
<li><p>Add a bond to an extra atom (a carbon, for example) to each point on the
group that will be attached to another group in the polymer.</p>
<p>For example, if you are building an ethylene monomer, add an extra carbon to
each end. At this point the ethylene monomer would look like butane. 
</p></li>
<li><p>Label the extra atoms as R groups, by right-clicking on them and choosing
one of the R group options from the <span class="GUI">Set R Group</span>
submenu.</p>
<p>The labels to use for each group type are:</p>
<p><b>Initiator:</b> Use R1 for each extra atom. All of the atoms so labeled
will initiate a chain.</p>
<p><b>Monomer:</b> Label the extra atom at the head as R1, and the extra atom at
the tail as R2. If the monomer can have a branch point, label the extra atom
for the branch as R3.</p>
<p><b>Terminator:</b> Label the extra atom as R1. There should be only one extra
atom for a terminator.</p>
<p><b>Cascader:</b> Label the extra atom that is attached to the main chain as
R1, and the extra atoms for initiating the new chains as R2. 
</p></li>
<li><p>To save the group as a template: </p>
<ol type="i">
<li>Click <span class="GUI">Save New Template</span>.</li>
<li>Enter a name for the template in the text box of
the <span class="GUI">Template Name</span> dialog box.</li> 
<li>Click <span class="GUI">OK</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The template is added to the <span class="GUI">Template</span> menu and is selected.
</p></li>
<li><p>To use the group without saving it, click <span class="GUI">Use This
Structure</span>.
</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Instructions for building the basic kinds of polymers are given below. More
complicated polymers can be built, but they follow the same basic procedure.</p>

<p><b>To build a simple unbranched polymer:</b></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Choose or sketch an initiator group.
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose or sketch a terminator group.
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose or sketch a monomer.
</p></li>
<li><p>If the monomer has a chiral group, choose the tacticity from
the <span class="GUI">Tacticity</span> option menu.
</p></li>
<li><p>In the <span class="GUI">Configuration</span> tab, set the number of
monomers in the polymer. 
</p></li>
<li><p>Click <span class="GUI">Run</span>.
</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The polymer is built, incorporated into the project, and displayed in the
Workspace.
</p>

<p><b>To build a branched polymer:</b></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Choose or sketch an initiator group.
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose or sketch a terminator group.
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose or sketch a monomer.</p>
<p>The monomer must be labeled with R1 for the head group, R2 for the tail
group, and R3 for the branch point. 
</p></li>
<li><p>If the monomer has a chiral group, choose the tacticity from
the <span class="GUI">Tacticity</span> option menu.
</p></li>
<li><p>Set the percentage probability of branching.</p>
<p>This determines how frequently branches are likely to occur within a given
chain. The percentage probability is applied to each monomer unit independently
to determine which ones will branch.
</p></li>
<li><p>Set the number of generations.</p>
<p>This determines how many times another set of chains is added to the
previous generation of chain additions. The first generation is the original
generation from the initiator: thus, two generations means that a set of chains
is added once, to the selected branch points on the original chain. Branch
points are chosen randomly in each generation. 
</p></li>
<li><p>In the <span class="GUI">Configuration</span> tab, set the number of
monomers in each chain of the polymer. 
</p></li>
<li><p>Click <span class="GUI">Run</span>.
</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The polymer is built, incorporated into the project, and displayed in the Workspace. 
</p>

<p><b>To build a block or periodic copolymer:</b></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Choose or sketch an initiator group.
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose or sketch a terminator group.
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose or sketch the first monomer.
</p></li>
<li><p>Click <span class="GUI">Add Monomer</span> to add another monomer
definition.
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose or sketch the next monomer.
</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat the previous two steps for each additional monomer.
</p></li>
<li><p>If any monomer has a chiral group, choose the tacticity from
its <span class="GUI">Tacticity</span> option menu.
</p></li>
<li><p>In the <span class="GUI">Configuration</span> tab, ensure that 
<span class="GUI">Block or periodic copolymer</span> is selected. 
</p></li>
<li><p>Specify the repeat unit in the <span class="GUI">Repeat unit</span> text
box by typing in the letter codes for the monomers in the desired sequence,
eg. AABBBB.
</p></li>
<li><p>Set the number of repeat units in the polymer. 
</p></li>
<li><p>Click <span class="GUI">Run</span>.
</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The polymer is built, incorporated into the project, and displayed in the Workspace. 
</p>

<p><b>To build a dendrimer:</b></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Choose or sketch an initiator group.</p>
<p>To make a dendrimer that branches from the initiator, ensure that you have
multiple R1 groups on the initiator. You can check this by pausing the pointer
over the empirical formula for the initiator. The 2D structure is shown in a
tooltip.  
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose or sketch a cascader group.</p>
<p>This group must have one R1 group and two or more R2 groups, depending on how
many branches you want to have at each branch point. 
</p></li>
<li><p>Set the number of generations for the cascader.</p>
<p>The cascader terminates the generation of a polymer chain (and initiates a
new generation) except for the last termination, where the terminator is added. 
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose or sketch a terminator group.
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose or sketch a monomer.
</p></li>
<li><p>If the monomer has a chiral group, choose the tacticity from
the <span class="GUI">Tacticity</span> option menu.
</p></li>
<li><p>In the <span class="GUI">Configuration</span> tab, set the number of
monomers in each chain of the dendrimer. 
</p></li>
<li><p>Click <span class="GUI">Run</span>.
</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The polymer is built, incorporated into the project, and displayed in the Workspace. 
</p>

<p><b>To create an amorphous cell:</b></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Make settings for an individual polymer, as described above.
</p></li>
<li><p>Set the number of polymers to be included in the cell.
</p></li>
<li><p>Set the initial density and the initial van der Waals scaling factor for
clash detection.
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose which of the density and scaling factor should be kept constant in
the process of creating the cell.
</p></li>
<li><p>Set limits on the attempts at placing single polymers and creating the
entire cell.
</p></li>
<li><p>Click Run.

<h3>Groups tab</h3>
<p>In this tab you specify the chemical groups you want to use for the polymer:
initiator, cascader, terminator, and monomers. How these are arranged is
specified in the <span class="GUI">Configuration</span> tab.
</p>

<p>There are some common controls for each type of group, which are described
first. Descriptions relating to each type of group are given next.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><span class="GUI">Sketch</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>This button opens a panel in which you can sketch the structure of the
group in 2D. In addition to drawing the structure, you will also have to label
groups as R groups, which you can do from the shortcut menu for the atom to be
converted to an R group. The labels and their requirements are discussed
with the group types, below.</p>
<p>Each instance of this panel has an option menu and several buttons at the
top, which you can use to load or save templates, or clear the drawing area. 
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Template</span> option menu&mdash;Choose an existing
template to customize, or choose <span class="GUI">Custom</span> to draw a new
group. 
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Save New Template</span> button&mdash;Save the current
structure as a new template. Opens a dialog box in which you can name the
template. 
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Manage Templates</span> button&mdash;Manage the custom
templates. You can perform the following actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Delete a template. Choose a template to delete from 
the <span class="GUI">Template</span> option menu and
click <span class="GUI">Delete Template</span>.</li>
<li>Set the template directory. Click <span class="GUI">Change Custom Template
Directory</span> and navigate to a new location for the templates, or click
<span class="GUI">Use Default Directory</span> to return to the default
directory for custom templates.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Import from Workspace</span> button&mdash;Import the
current Workspace structure into the panel. The structure is drawn in 2D, and
you can modify and label it. 
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Clear Sketcher</span> button&mdash;Clear the drawing
area of all structures (which are discarded). 
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Below the drawing area there is a <span class="GUI">Cancel</span> button, to
return to the main panel without setting up a structure for the group, and a
<span class="GUI">Use This Structure</span> button, to use the drawn structure
for the group and close the panel. 
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Option menu</dt>
<dd><p>This option menu lists the available template molecules for the group,
including any templates you defined in the sketcher panel. 
</p></dd>
<dt>Empirical formula display</dt>
<dd><p>The empirical formula of the group is displayed to the right of the
option menu. 
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Name</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>This text box shows the name of the group. If you chose a template, the
name is filled in from the template name. You can set or change the name by
editing the text in the text box. 
</p></dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<a name="feature1.1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">End groups</span> section</dt>
<dd><p>This section specifies the groups that are used to initiate or terminate
polymerization, or to create a cascade. Each of the three types of end group have
common features, which are described above. The specific conditions on each type
are described here; in particular the labels that must be applied to define the
points at which the bonds are formed.  
</p>
<dl>
<dt><span class="GUI">Initiator</span></dt>
<dd><p>These controls define the initiator for the polymerization. The
initiator must have at least one R group defined, which is the group that is
discarded when forming a bond with the monomer. If you create your own
initiator, you must add an R1 label to the group that is discarded.</p>
<p>You can add multiple R1 labels, and the (same) polymer is built from each
point on the initiator that is so labeled. This enables you to build
dendrimers.
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Cascader</span></dt>
<dd><p>These controls define a cascader, which is used to create dendritic
structures. The cascader must be labeled with one R1 group and two or more R2
groups. The R2 groups define points at which the chain from the initiator is
replicated, to form a dendritic structure.</p>
<p>In addition to the controls to define the group, there is
a <span class="GUI">Generations</span> box, in which you can define the number
of replications of the polymer chain in the dendrimer. The minimum number is 2,
which means that there is one cascader on each chain from the initiator, to
which copies of this chain are attached in place of the R2 groups. 
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Terminator</span></dt>
<dd><p>These controls define the terminator of the polymerization. A terminator
group must have exactly one R1 group defined (and no others).  
</p></dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<a name="feature1.2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Monomers</span> section</dt>
<dd><p>In this section the monomer units for the polymerization are defined. </p>

<dl>
<dt><span class="GUI">Add Monomer</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Click this button to add a monomer unit. A new set of controls for a
monomer unit is added below the last set of monomer controls. The monomers are
labeled with letters, A, B, C, and so on. These letter codes are used in
the <span class="GUI">Configuration</span> tab to specify the order in which the
monomer units are used.
</p></dd>

<dt>Monomer group definition controls</dt>
<dd><p>These controls define the monomer structure. Each monomer group must have
a single R1 group for the head, and a single R2 group for the tail. If you
create your own monomer groups, you must define them as they are in the polymer,
not in the isolated molecule. For example, for polyethylene, the monomer must
have a single C&ndash;C bond, with two hydrogens and one R group at each end. To
create this monomer, you would draw butane, and convert the terminal carbons to
an R1 and an R2.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">All trans</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Select this option to ensure that the internal configuration of the
monomer unit is all trans. If you deselect this option, the geometry is
determined by the minimization of the monomer unit when it is converted from 2D
to 3D. This includes the dihedrals involving the first atom on the next and
previous unit (or, alternatively, the dihedrals involving the R1 and R2 groups
in the monomer). 
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Branching</span> controls</dt>
<dd><p>A monomer group can have an R3 group as well as an R1 and an R2
group. The R3 group designates a point where a new chain can be attached, to
create branched polymers.  If a monomer group has an R3 group, the 
<span class="GUI">Branching</span> controls are enabled, and you can specify the
probability of branching and the maximum number of generations when
branching.</p>
<p>The branching probability is applied to each monomer unit independently, to
decide whether it will branch or not. With this approach, there is a small but
finite probability of none of the monomers branching, or of all of them
branching.</p> 
<p>Each branch is created by taking a copy of the chain before branching and
attaching it to the branch point. If you specify more than two generations,
branch points are chosen at random for each added chain, so the branch points
can be different in each chain that is added in each generation. The process is
repeated for each subsequent generation.</p>
<p>If an R3 group is not chosen as a branch point in the random selection, it is
replaced with the terminating group.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Tacticity</span> option menu</dt>
<dd><p>If the monomer unit is chiral, you can specify the tacticity of the
polymer, by choosing an option from this option menu:  
<span class="GUI">Isotactic</span> (same
stereochemistry), <span class="GUI">Syndiotactic</span> (alternating
stereochemistry) or <span class="GUI">Atactic</span> (random
stereochemistry). Note that any stereochemistry specified when sketching the
monomer is ignored. 
</p></dd>

<dt>Delete button</dt>
<dd><p>To delete a monomer, click the delete (X) button on the right. The
controls for the monomer are removed from the panel and the information on the
monomer is discarded.
</p></dd>
</dl>

</dd>
</dl>

<a name="feature2"></a>
<h3>Configuration tab</h3>
<p>
</p>

<dl>
<a name="feature2.1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Composition</span> section</dt>
<dd><p>In this section you specify how the monomers are arranged to form the
polymer, and the number of repeat units in the polymer. The type of polymer that
can be formed depends on the number of monomer units, and is reflected in the
options of this section. These three options, with their controls, are described
below. 
</p>
<dl>
<dt><span class="GUI">Homopolymer</span></dt>
<dd><p>If there is only one monomer specified, this is the only option available
and it is selected by default. You can specify the length of the polymer chain
in the <span class="GUI">Number of monomers</span> box. The polymer can be
branched if you specified a branch point on the monomer. In this case each of
the branches has the number of monomers specified in the <span class="GUI">Number 
of monomers</span> box.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Block or periodic copolymer</span></dt>
<dd><p>If you specified more than one monomer, you can construct a block or
periodic copolymer by choosing this option. You can then specify the repeat unit
and the number of repeat units. 
</p>
<dl>
<dt><span class="GUI">Repeat unit</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>Specify the repeat unit in this text box, using the letter codes for the
monomer units as displayed in the <span class="GUI">Groups</span> tab. These
letter codes with the monomer names are shown to the left of
the <span class="GUI">Block or periodic copolymer</span> option. To specify the
repeat unit, enter the sequence of letter codes. If there are repeated monomer
units, you can instead use a repeat count following the letter code, e.g. A3 is
the same as AAA.</p>
<p>If you want to enumerate several polymers in which one or more positions has
each of the monomers, you can use a * to designate an enumeration site. A list
of repeat units is constructed that contains each of the possible monomers at
this site. For example, if you have three monomer units, then AB* generates the
three repeat units ABA, ABB, and ABC. Each of these is used in a separate
polymer: ABAABAABA..., ABBABBABB..., and ABCABCABC...; only one repeat unit is
used in each polymer. You can have more than one enumeration site. For example,
with two monomers, A*B* would generate four repeat units, AABA, AABB, ABBA, and
ABBB. The number of polymers generated is shown to the right of the number of
repeat units as <span class="GUI">Enumerated polymers</span>.
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Number of repeat units</span> box</dt>
<dd><p>Specify the number of repeat units (as defined above) in a polymer
chain. If the polymer is branched or dendritic, each chain that is initiated
from a branch point or cascader has this length. 
</p></dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Random copolymer</span></dt>
<dd><p>If you specified more than one monomer, you can construct a random
copolymer by choosing this option.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><span class="GUI">Weights</span> boxes</dt>
<dd><p>Specify the relative probability of choosing each monomer for addition to
the polymer at each polymerization step in these boxes,
which are labeled with the letter code for the monomer. The letter codes with
the monomer names are show to the right of the <span class="GUI">Random

the <span class="GUI">Number of monomers</span> box.
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Number of monomers</span> box</dt>

<dl>
<dt><span class="GUI">Nonstandard coupling probabilities</span> boxes</dt>
<dd><p>If you want to allow tail-to-tail or head-to-head couplings, instead of
just head-to-tail couplings, you can set the percentage probabilities of each
type occuring on the addition of another monomer, in
the <span class="GUI">Tail-tail</span> and <span class="GUI">Head-head</span>
boxes. The random number generator is used in conjunction with these percentage
probabilities to determine whether the coupling of the next monomer unit is
nonstandard, when building the polymer.

<dd><p>You can set the backbone dihedral angle or specify a range of angles with
these options. The backbone dihedral is the dihedral angle between adjacent
monomer units; the three vectors are the vectors that connect the head and tail
of each monomer, and the vector that connects one monomer to the next.

<dt><span class="GUI">Set</span> option and box</dt>
<dd><p>Select this option to set the backbone dihedral to a specific angle in
degrees, which you enter in the box. 
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Random</span></dt>
<dd><p>Select this option to allow random selection of a backbone dihedral
within a specified range of angles. You can set the limits of the range in the
<span class="GUI">Min</span> and <span class="GUI">Max</span> boxes.

</dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Avoid clashes</span> option
and <span class="GUI">Options</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Select this option to avoid clashes when randomly selecting backbone
dihedrals. Clashes are considered to occur if the nonbonded interatomic distance
between two atoms is smaller than the scaled sum of the atomic van der Waals
radii of the atoms. If a clash is detected, all of the dihedrals between the
clashing atoms are retried until a non-clashing orientation is found, or the
number of tries exceeds a specified maximum. You can set the van der Waals scale
factor and the maximum retries in the <span class="GUI">Backbone Dihedral Clash
Options</span> dialog box, which you open by clicking 
<span class="GUI">Options</span>.

<h3>Amorphous Cell tab</h3>
<p>In this tab you can create an amorphous cell from the polymers that you
build. The cell is cubic, and the size is determined from the number of polymers
and the final density.
</p>

<dl>
<a name="feature4.1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Create amorphous cell</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Select this option to create an amorphous cell. 
</p></dd>
<a name="feature4.2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Number of polymers</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>Specify the number of polymers to place in the cell. 
</p></dd>
<a name="feature4.3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Initial density</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>Specify the initial density of the polymer in g cm<sup>&minus;3</sup>. 
The density may be adjusted to avoid clashes, depending on the option for the
value to keep constant. 
</p></dd>
<a name="feature4.4"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Initial clash VDW scale factor</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>Specify the initial scaling factor for detecting clashes. A clash is
considered to occur if the nonbonded interatomic distance between two atoms is
smaller than the scaled sum of the atomic van der Waals radii of the atoms.
</p></dd>
<a name="feature4.5"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Keep constant</span> options</dt>
<dd><p>Choose an option for the quantity to keep constant when constructing the
cell. The other quantity is adjusted during the placement of polymers to avoid
clashes. Choosing <span class="GUI">Density</span> keeps the density at its
initial value and changes the scale factor for clashes to eliminate clashes. 
This option might result in polymers that are too close. 
Choosing <span class="GUI">VDW scale factor</span> keeps the clash detection the
same, and adjusts the density to eliminate clashes. This might result in a
density that is lower than desired. 
</p></dd>
<a name="feature4.6"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Placement attempts per polymer</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>Specify the maximum number of attempts to be made when placing a polymer
in the cell. In each attempt, the polymer is oriented at random and placed in
the cell at random. If a clash is detected, the attempt is regarded as failed,
and a new attempt is made. If the maximum number of attempts is exceeded, the
cell is discarded and a new cell is built. 
</p></dd>
<a name="feature4.7"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Attempts per density/clash distance</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>Specify the maximum number of attempts at building a cell. If a
non-clashing cell cannot be built in this number of attempts, the density is
lowered or the van der Waals scaling factor is lowered, depending on
the <span class="GUI">Keep constant</span> option. The process continues until a
non-clashing cell can be built, or the density or scale factor are very small.

carbons, red oxygens, blue nitrogens, and so on. 
See the <a href="../workspace_menu/color_schemes.html">Atom Color Schemes</a> 
topic for information on standard color schemes.
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Monomer</span>&mdash;Color each monomer type with a
unique color. Initiators, cascaders, and terminators are considered separate
monomer types for coloring. This is useful for identifying the sequence of
monomers in a copolymer.
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Monomer chirality</span>&mdash;Color monomers that have
R chirality in green, those that have S chirality in cyan, and those with no
chirality in red (including initiators, cascaders, and terminators). 
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Backbone/side group</span>&mdash;Color the backbone
atoms green, the side groups cyan, and anything else red (initiators,
cascaders, terminators, H attached to backbone). 
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Molecule</span>&mdash;Color each polymer molecule with
a unique color. This scheme is useful when creating an amorphous cell, to
distinguish the polymers in the cell.

<dd><p>These two option menus have the same items, for rendering the polymer
structure in ball-and-stick representation or in tube representation. The
default representation is wire (also known as &quot;lines&quot;). As tube
representation is applied last, it will replace ball-and-stick representation if
atoms chosen for tube were already chosen for ball-and-stick. 
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="GUI">None</span>&mdash;Do not render anything in the chosen representation.

that have S chirality in the chosen representation. 
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Head</span>&mdash;Render the head atom in each monomer
in the chosen representation. This is the atom attached to the R1 group. The
atom attached to R1 for initializers, terminators and cascaders are also
considered head atoms.
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Tail</span>&mdash;Render the tail atom in each
monomer in the chosen representation.

a subdirectory of the current working directory that is named with the job
name.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Job status</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>This icon indicates when there are jobs running for the application that
belong to the current project. It starts spinning when the first job starts, and
stops when there are no more jobs running. If a job fails to start, it changes
to an exclamation point. 
</p>
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/job_status.png" />
<p>
Clicking the button shows a small job status window that lists the job name and
status for all active jobs submitted from the current panel (for Jaguar and
MacroModel this means all jobs from any of the application panels). You can
double-click on a row to open the <a href="../misc/monitor_panel.html"><span
class="GUI">Monitor</span> panel</a> and monitor the job, or click the <span
class="GUI">Monitor</span> button to open the <span class="GUI">Monitor</span>
panel and close the job status window. The job status is updated while the
window is open. If a job finishes while the window is open, the job remains
displayed but with the new status.  The rows are colored according to the
status: yellow for submitted, green for launched, running, or finished, red for
incorporated, died, or killed.  Click anywhere outside the window to close it.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Run</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Run the job with the current job settings.
