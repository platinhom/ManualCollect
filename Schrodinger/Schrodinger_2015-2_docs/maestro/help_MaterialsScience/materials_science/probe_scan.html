<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Explore the potential energy surface of a molecule with respect to a probe
molecule, by calculating QM energies of the probe-target system at a set of
probe grid points. The grid is a set of points on one or more surfaces
surrounding the target.
</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Probe Scan Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Probe Scan</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Tasks &rarr; Grid Scan</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Applications &rarr; Materials Science &rarr; Grid Scan</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Using the Probe Scan Panel</h2> 


<p>This panel is designed to produce a potential energy map around a target 
molecule for a specified probe. The probe can be a point charge, an atom, or a
molecule with a designated &quot;probe atom&quot;. The probe atom is placed at
points on a grid, and the QM energy of the system is evaluated, with optional
optimization. The grid points are computed to lie on one or more surfaces, which
are placed at a specified distance from the van der Waals surface of the target.
</p>
<p>When the probe atom is placed, it is considered to be bonded to the nearest
target atom. You can optimize the target molecule geometry in the target probe
system, the probe molecule geometry, the distance between the target atom and
the probe atom, and the orientation of the probe with respect to the target
atom. These options all allow optimization to a local minimum near the target
atom: more optimization gives higher accuracy but with higher cost. You can also
do a full optimization of the system, with no restraints.
</p>
<p>The result is a set of structures at each grid point with an energy, indices
of target and probe atoms, grid coordinates, and probe-target atom direction
vector. You can choose to return all the results, or you can choose to group the
results by the target atom that the probe atom is closest to, and return only
the lowest-energy structure per target atom.
</p>
<p>This panel is useful for determining low-energy adsorption sites of a
molecule on some substrate, which might be another molecule, a nanoparticle, a
catalytic oxide, for example. For molecule-molecule interactions it can be
useful for finding the pre-positioned reactant and product complexes on either
side of the barrier in a transition state search.

box.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Single atom</span>&mdash;Use a single atom as the probe,

The <span class="GUI">Import Probe</span> dialog box opens, which you use to
pick the probe atom, and specify the orientation of the probe with respect to
the nearest target atom when the probe is placed on the grid. The arrow that is

a point charge or a charged molecule as a probe, the target charge is the value
given in this box minus the probe charge.

<dd><p>Choose an option for the distance at which the first surface of grid
points is placed, with respect to the van der Waals radius surface of the
target. The default is the van der Waals radius of the probe atom (<span

specifying the distance in the text box.

<dd><p>Specify the number of surfaces in the grid. Setting this value greater
than 1 produces a volume rather than a surface. If you do specify multiple
surfaces, you should avoid optimizing the probe-target distance (or location),
as it could easily collapse onto a point from another shell, and the volume
generated might not be very useful.

the grid parameters and want to visualize the grid again. It has no effect on
the calculation, as the current set of parameters is always used when you run
the job.

<dt><span class="GUI">Job status</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>This icon indicates when there are jobs running for the application that

<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/job_status.png" />
<p>
Clicking the button shows a small job status window that lists the job name and
status for all active jobs submitted from the current panel (for Jaguar and
MacroModel this means all jobs from any of the application panels). You can
double-click on a row to open the <a href="../misc/monitor_panel.html"><span
class="GUI">Monitor</span> panel</a> and monitor the job, or click the <span
class="GUI">Monitor</span> button to open the <span class="GUI">Monitor</span>
panel and close the job status window. The job status is updated while the
window is open. If a job finishes while the window is open, the job remains
displayed but with the new status.  The rows are colored according to the
status: yellow for submitted, green for launched, running, or finished, red for
incorporated, died, or killed.  Click anywhere outside the window to close it.
