<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Build a set of organometallic complexes from a set of ligands. Each complex
is composed of a metal, an optional &quot;sentinel&quot; ligand that remains the
same in each complex, and enough copies of one other ligand to fill the
coordination sites for the chosen complex geometry. 
</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Build Multiple Complexes Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Build Multiple Complexes</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Tools &rarr; Build Multiple Complexes</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Applications &rarr; Materials Science &rarr; Build Organometallic Complexes &rarr; Build Multiple Complexes</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
</ul>


<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Build Multiple Complexes Panel</h2> 


<p>This panel is intended for building a set of organometallic complexes from a
set of ligands that are variations on a common core. To build such a set of
ligands, you can use the <a href="interactive_enumeration.html"><span
class="GUI">Interactive Enumeration</span> panel</a>. This panel allows you to
choose a core structure, which is the one that is bound to the metal, select
side chains on this core as attachment points for new functional groups, and
replace the side chains with a set of fragments, to build a set of structures.
The important feature for building a set of complexes is that the core is the
same in each ligand, as you have to designate one or more points on the core
that are attached to the metal.
</p>
<p>The coordinating (ligating) atoms are specified by their atom number. To find
out what the atom numbering is in your ligands, you can label one of the ligands
in the Workspace. Include a ligand, display the <span class="GUI">Labels</span>
toolbar if it is not displayed (click <span class="GUI">Labels</span> on the
<span class="GUI">Manager</span> toolbar or choose <span class="GUI">Edit &rarr; Settings &rarr; Toolbars &rarr; Select Toolbars Displayed</span><span class="GUI"> &rarr;
Labels</span>), then click the <span class="GUI">Label All</span> button on the
toolbar and choose <span class="GUI">Atom Number</span>.
</p>
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/labelatoms.png" />
<p>You can then use the numbers displayed on the atom to specify the
coordinating atom (monodentate ligand) or atoms (bidentate ligand). 
</p>
<p>When specifying the atom that is ligated, you can request the removal of
atoms that are attached to the ligating atom: for example, if you have a
secondary amine in a ring (such as in pyrrole), you might want to remove the
attached hydrogen. If there are no extra atoms to remove (as for example for
cyano), select <span class="GUI">Dative bond</span>. If there is a single extra
hydrogen (as for example in pyrrole), select <span class="GUI">Remove lone
hydrogen</span>. If some other functional group is attached to the coordinating
atom, select <span class="GUI">Remove atom</span>, and choose the atom from the
list, which shows the atomic symbol and the atom number. The attached atom and
all atoms in the side chain originating at the attached atom are removed when
the complex is built. For example, if the atom to remove is the C in a
CONH<sub>2</sub> group, the entire CONH<sub>2</sub> group is removed. Likewise,
if the atom is part of a phenyl group, the entire phenyl group is removed. If
the atom to remove and the coordinating atom are part of the same ring system,
no additional atoms are removed beyond the specified atom to remove.
</p>
<p>To specify the complex geometry and isomer, choose from
the <span class="GUI">Geometry</span> and <span class="GUI">Isomer</span> option
menus. The <span class="GUI">Isomer</span> option menu is available if you have
bidentate ligands and an octahedral or square planar complex. For octahedral
complexes, you can choose to build a meridional or facial isomer.  Both isomers
are chiral, but only one of the stereoisomers is built. The facial stereoisomer
is in the &Lambda; form, the meridional stereoisomer is in the &Delta; form. (To
convert to the other stereoisomer, display the <span class="GUI">Build</span>
toolbar, and double-click the <span class="GUI">R/S</span> button.)  If the
ligands are symmetric, there are only the two stereoisomers, which are built by
choosing the facial or meridional isomer. For square planar complexes with
asymmetric bidentate ligands, you can choose to build the cis or the trans
isomer.
</p>
<p>If you want to construct complexes with a common ligand, while enumerating
other ligands, you can select <span class="GUI">Sentinel ligand</span>, then
specify the ligand to use as the common (&quot;sentinel&quot;) ligand and the
number of copies of this ligand to use. The ligand can be monodentate or
bidentate. The remaining sites in the complex are filled with the
&quot;enumeration&quot; ligands.</p>
<p>You can choose the sentinel ligand from the <span class="GUI">Ligand</span>
option menu, or sketch a new ligand by clicking <span class="GUI">Sketch</span>
and drawing it in the <span class="GUI">Ligand Sketcher</span>.  You must
indicate which atoms are the ligating atoms, by adding a bond to them and
labeling the terminal atom as R<sub>1</sub> for the first ligating atom, and
R<sub>2</sub> for the second. Right-click on the atom and
choose <span class="GUI">Set R Group &rarr; R1</span>
or <span class="GUI">R2</span> to perform the labeling. When you have finished
sketching the ligand, click <span class="GUI">Use This Structure</span> to use
it for this run only, or click <span class="GUI">Save New Template</span>, to
save it as a &quot;template&quot; ligand, which is added to the list of ligands
on the <span class="GUI">Ligand</span> option menu.
</p>

<p>When you have built the complexes, you should consider cleaning them up with
the <a href="ligand_cleanup.html"><span class="GUI">Ligand Cleanup</span>
panel</a>, and then running a geometry optimization with Jaguar before
proceeding with any calculations on the complexes.

<p>The coordinating atom number is the atom number in the Maestro file. If you

markers. </p>
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/labelatoms.png" />
<p>The ligands that you choose must all have the same atom numbers for the part

therefore be a series of related ligands, such as generated in the 
<a href="interactive_enumeration.html"><span class="GUI">Interactive
Enumeration</span> panel</a>.</p>
<p>The options for coordination behavior allow you to specify how the ligand is
prepared for coordination. If the coordinating atom on the ligand donates to the
metal, select <span class="GUI">Dative bond</span>. If the ligand has a hydrogen
attached to the coordinating atom that is removed (i.e. it is an acid of some
kind), select <span class="GUI">Remove lone hydrogen</span>. If there is some
other atom attached, select <span class="GUI">Remove atom</span> and choose the
atom number from the option menu. This option requires a structure in the
Workspace, so that the atoms connected to the coordinating atom can be
determined. This atom is removed along with all atoms in the side chain that
originates with this atom. The atom to be removed is marked with a red marker on
the structure in the Workspace (if present).
