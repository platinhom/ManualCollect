<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
In this panel you can manage the hypotheses that are available to the project.
This includes, creating, editing, and deleting hypotheses, importing and
exporting hypotheses, and adding excluded volumes to hypotheses.
</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Manage Pharmacophore Hypotheses Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Manage Pharmacophore Hypotheses</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Applications &rarr; More Applications &rarr; Phase &rarr; Manage Pharmacophore Hypotheses</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The <span class="GUI">Manage Pharmacophore Hypotheses</span> panel opens
automatically after you create a hypothesis manually&mdash;see the
<a href="new_hypothesis_db.html">New Hypothesis Dialog Box</a> topic for more
information.
</p>

<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Manage Pharmacophore Hypotheses Panel</h2> 


<p>
In the <span class="GUI">Manage Pharmacophore Hypotheses</span> panel, you can create and
edit hypotheses based on an individual structure (the reference ligand), rather
than on a set of structures that share common features. This capability allows
you to use your knowledge of the binding of a particular ligand to generate a
set of pharmacophore features that can be used in a database search.
</p>
<p>New hypotheses are created using a set of pharmacophore features. Maestro uses
the feature definitions to identify all the possible pharmacophore sites in the
reference ligand. You can then choose which sites you want to include in the
hypothesis. You can also edit the feature definitions using the
<a href="edit_features.html"><span class="GUI">Edit
Features</span> dialog box</a>. </p>

<p>As well as creating new hypotheses, you can export hypotheses and import them
for editing, including hypotheses that were exported from the <span
class="GUI">Develop Common Pharmacophore Hypotheses</span> panel. You cannot edit
hypotheses from a pharmacophore model development run directly: you must export
them to a file or add them to the Project Table first, then you can edit the copy.</p>

<p>Hypotheses are stored as entries in the Project Table along with their reference
ligand. Each hypotheses therefore has an entry ID as well as a hypothesis ID
and a title.  The <span class="GUI">Hypotheses</span> table is a restricted view of
the content of the Project Table that includes only those entries that have
hypotheses. </p>

<p><b>Warning:</b> When creating a new hypothesis, you should ensure that your
structure is a 3D, all-atom structure. If it is not, the pharmacophore features
are likely to be incorrectly assigned.
</p>

<p><b>To create a new hypothesis:</b></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Duplicate the entry in the Project Table (<span
class="Keys">Ctrl+D</span> (<span class="Keys">&#x2318;D</span>)).</p>
<p>This is necessary to ensure that the original entry is not overwritten. 
</p></li>
<li><p>Click <span class="GUI">New</span>.
</p><p>
Alternatively, you can choose <span class="GUI">Applications &gt; Phase &gt;
Create Hypothesis</span> in the main window.
</p><p>
The <span class="GUI">Choose Reference Ligand</span> dialog box is displayed.
The list in the center of the dialog box lists entries from the Project
Table.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Select the duplicated entry from the list.
</p><p>
The entry name appears in the <span class="GUI">Name</span> text box.
</p></li>
<li><p>Click <span class="GUI">Choose</span>.
</p><p>The <span class="GUI">New Hypothesis</span> dialog box is displayed.
The dialog box has two site lists: one of available sites in the reference
ligand, and one of sites selected for the hypothesis, which is initially empty.
You can choose which sites are displayed in the Workspace in the <span class="GUI">Mark sites</span> section. By default, all sites are marked.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Select the sites you want to include in your hypothesis, and click
<span class="GUI">Add</span>.
</p><p>
The selected sites are added to the <span class="GUI">Hypothesis sites</span> list. You can select multiple sites by
shift-clicking and control-clicking. You can also select sites one-at-a-time and
add them, and you can remove sites from the list. The
<span class="GUI">Hypothesis sites</span> list does not change when you add or
remove sites.
</p></li>
<li><p>
When you have selected the desired sites, click <span class="GUI">OK</span>.
</p><p>
The <span class="GUI">New Hypothesis</span> dialog box closes, and the
hypothesis is displayed in the Workspace and added to the
<span class="GUI">Available Hypotheses</span> table of the
<span class="GUI">Manage Pharmacophore Hypotheses</span> panel.
</p></li>
</ol>

<p><b>To edit an existing hypothesis:</b></p>
<ol>
<li><p>
Select the hypothesis in the <span class="GUI">Hypotheses</span>
table, and click <span class="GUI">Edit</span>.
</p><p>
The <span class="GUI">Edit Hypothesis</span> dialog box is displayed.
This dialog box is identical to the <span class="GUI">New
Hypothesis</span> dialog box. The dialog box has two site lists: one of
available sites in the reference ligand, and one of sites included in the hypothesis.
You can choose which sites are displayed in the Workspace in the <span class="GUI">Mark sites</span> section. By default, the hypothesis sites are
marked.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Select the ligand sites you want to add to your hypothesis, and click
<span class="GUI">Add</span>.
</p><p>
The selected sites are added to the <span class="GUI">Hypothesis sites</span>
list. You can select multiple sites by shift-clicking and control-clicking.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Select the hypothesis sites you want to remove from your hypothesis, and click
<span class="GUI">Remove</span>.
</p><p>
The selected sites are removed from the <span class="GUI">Hypothesis sites</span>
list. You can select multiple sites by shift-clicking and control-clicking.
</p></li>
<li><p>
When you have made the desired changes, click <span class="GUI">OK</span>.
</p><p>
The <span class="GUI">Edit Hypothesis</span> dialog box closes.

<h3>Manage Pharmacophore Hypotheses</h3>

<p>The <span class="GUI">Hypotheses</span> table lists the
hypotheses that are in the Project Table. You can select a single row of the
table, for editing, deleting, adding excluded volumes to, or exporting the
hypothesis. The columns of the table are described below. The table is
noneditable, with the exception of the <span class="GUI">Title</span> and the
<span class="GUI">Hypothesis ID</span>. As in the Project Table, the <span
class="GUI">In</span> and <span class="GUI">Title</span> columns are in a fixed
region, and the remaining columns are in a scrolling region.

diamond has a cross in it if the ligand is included in the Workspace, and is
empty if the ligand is excluded. You can include and exclude ligands and their
hypotheses with click, shift-click and control-click.  The hypothesis features are
displayed as described in the <a href="create_sites.html#feature6">Create
