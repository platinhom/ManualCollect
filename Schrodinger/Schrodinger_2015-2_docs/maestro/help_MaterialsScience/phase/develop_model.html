<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
This panel provides the tools for developing a pharmacophore model from a set
of ligands. There are five steps in the process used to develop a pharmacophore
model: preparing the ligands, identifying features and creating
pharmacophore sites from them, finding common pharmacophores, scoring the
hypotheses, and building a QSAR model.
</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Develop Common Pharmacophore Hypotheses Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Develop Common Pharmacophore Hypotheses</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Applications &rarr; More Applications &rarr; Phase &rarr; Develop Common Pharmacophore Hypotheses</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
</ul>


<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Develop Common Pharmacophore Hypotheses Panel</h2> 


<p>The <span class="GUI">Develop Common Pharmacophore Hypotheses</span> panel is
designed like a wizard, with five steps. To develop a model from scratch, you
proceed through each step in turn. However, the design allows you to pick up the
process at any step for which you have the required data. So if you have a set
of ligands and you want to change the features to develop a different model, you
do not need to start at the first step, which is preparing the ligands. Instead,
you can go straight to the second step, which is defining features and creating
sites. The design also allows you to exit at an intermediate stage and pick up
the process again later.</p>

<p>To navigate the steps, you can click the <span class="GUI">Back</span> and <span class="GUI">Next</span> buttons, click the desired step in the Guide, or choose the
desired step from the <span class="GUI">Step</span> menu.</p>

<p>The process of developing a pharmacophore model is called a <i>run</i>. The
data for each run is stored as a separate entity, which you can open from the
<span class="GUI">File</span> menu. </p>

<p>The tasks involved in each step are summarized below. </p>

<h3>The Prepare Ligands Step</h3>

<p>In this step, you add to the run the ligands that you want to use as the
basis for the pharmacophore model and any other ligands that you want to use to
build or test the QSAR model, and you select ligands for the active set that is
used for the pharmacophore model. If you include activity data with the ligands
when you add them, you can use a cutoff to select the most active ligands. You
can also select the active set manually. </p>

<p>To develop a pharmacophore model, you should ensure that you have all-atom 3D
structures, and generate different conformations for each structure. If the
structures need to be converted from 2D to 3D or otherwise need cleaning up, you
can do so in this step. You can also convert the structures to the most probable
ionization (protonation) state at a given pH, and generate generate different
chiralities for the ligands in this step. The ligands that you add are
automatically grouped into conformer sets. You can choose to group
stereoisomers in the same set or different sets.  If you add only one
conformer for a given ligand, you can generate the rest in this step.</p>

<p>Once you have added the ligands and classified them as active or inactive,
you can proceed to the next step. </p>

<h3>The Create Sites Step</h3>

<p>In this step, you use a set of chemical structure patterns to identify
pharmacophore features in each ligand. Once a feature has been mapped to a
specific location in a conformation, it is referred to as a <i>pharmacophore site</i>.
The number of occurrences of each feature in each ligand is tabulated, and you
can display the locations of the pharmacophore sites in the Workspace.</p>

<p>While the built-in set of features is adequate for many purposes, you might
want to add new patterns to the built-in features, ignore patterns in the
built-in features, or add custom features. You can add
functional groups, defined as SMARTS patterns, to the definition of a feature. You can
also designate functional groups that should be excluded from consideration as part of a
feature, and you can choose to ignore functional groups. </p>

<h3>The Find Common Pharmacophores Step</h3>

<p>In this step, you perform a search for common pharmacophores among the set of
high-affinity (active) ligands that you chose in the first step. The search
spans one or more families of pharmacophores, known as variants. You can choose
the number of site points in the
pharmacophore, filter out variants that have too many or too few of a particular
kind of feature, and select a set of variants from the filtered list. You can also set a
lower limit on the number of ligands that must match a pharmacophore before it
can be considered to be a hypothesis. </p>

<p>The search proceeds by enumerating all pharmacophores of a given variant and
partitioning them into successively smaller high-dimensional boxes according to
their intersite distances.  Each <i>n</i>-point pharmacophore contains
<i>n</i>(<i>n</i>&minus;1)/2 unique intersite distances, so each box contains
<i>n</i>(<i>n</i>&minus;1)/2 dimensions.  Pharmacophores that are clustered into the
same box are considered to be equivalent and therefore common to the ligands
from which they arise. The size of the box defines the tolerance on each
intersite distance, and therefore how similar common pharmacophores must be. You
can set parameters to control the minimum box size and you can exclude
pharmacophores for which any intersite distance is below a certain threshold.</p>

<p>Boxes that contain pharmacophores from the minimum required number of ligands
are said to survive the partitioning process. Each surviving box contains a set
of common pharmacophores, one of which is ultimately singled out as a
hypothesis. </p>

<p>Once all desired variants have been processed in this manner, you can continue
to the scoring step. </p>

<h3>The Score Hypotheses Step</h3>

<p>In this step you apply a scoring function that identifies the best candidate
hypothesis from each surviving box, and provides an overall ranking of all the
hypotheses. You can finish at this point, or select a hypothesis for the
generation of a QSAR model and continue to the next step. You can also add to
the hypothesis volumes that may not be occupied by atoms in any active molecule
(&quot;excluded volumes&quot;). </p>

<p>The scoring algorithm includes contributions from the alignment of site
points and vectors, volume overlap, selectivity, and number of ligands
matched. You can adjust some of these in the survival score, and you can create
a custom score. The scores for each hypothesis are displayed in a table. You can
select a hypothesis and view scores for the ligands that match the hypothesis,
and the energy of the ligand relative to the lowest conformation. </p>

<p>If you have both active and inactive molecules that match a hypothesis, you
can use their structures to define excluded volumes. Any part of an inactive
molecule that is not occupied by the active molecules is a good candidate for an
excluded volume.  The excluded volumes are used to filter out molecules in the
database search that are likely to be inactive.</p>

<p>When you have selected a hypothesis, you can proceed to the next step.</p>

<h3>The Build QSAR Model Step</h3>

<p>In this step, you build a QSAR model for a selected hypothesis using the
activity data for molecules that match at least three points in the hypothesis.
You can use molecules with any level of activity, including those that may be
inactive due to steric clashes with the target receptor. The QSAR model
partitions space into a grid of uniformly sized cubes, and characterizes each
molecule by a set of binary-valued independent variables that encode the
occupancy of the cubes by each of six atom classes. Partial least-squares
regression is applied to these variables to build a series of models with
successively greater numbers of factors. </p>

<p>You can visualize the QSAR model in the Workspace, and analyze it by atom
class and ligand. This can be used to identify ligand features that contribute
positively or negatively to the predicted activity.</p>

<p>When you have developed a QSAR model, you can continue to the database search
and use the QSAR model to predict activities for matches.</p>
