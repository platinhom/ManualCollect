<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
In this panel you can search a prepared database for matches to a selected
hypothesis. The panel provides options for matching and for processing the hits.
</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Advanced Pharmacophore Screening Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Advanced Pharmacophore Screening</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Applications &rarr; More Applications &rarr; Phase &rarr; Advanced Pharmacophore Screening</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
<li><p>Click <span class="GUI">Search for Matches</span> in the 
<span class="GUI">Score Hypotheses</span> step of the <span class="GUI">Build Common Pharmacophore Hypotheses</span> panel.</p></li>
<li><p>Click <span class="GUI">Search for Matches</span> in the 
<span class="GUI">Build QSAR Model</span> step of the <span class="GUI">Build Common Pharmacophore Hypotheses</span> panel.</p></li>
</ul>


<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Advanced Pharmacophore Screening Panel</h2> 


<p>To perform a search, you must select a source of structures and a hypothesis,
set any options for conformer generation matching and for filtering and
treatment of the hits, then click <span class="GUI">Run</span> to start the
job. You might want to make job settings before starting the job, to choose a
host for the job. See the <a href="#job_toolbar">Job toolbar</a> section for
more information.</p>

<p>The process of finding matches involves searching the structure source for
matches to the hypothesis, which generates a list of matches; then applying any
filtering to the matches, such as limits on the number of hits and excluded
volumes; then computing a score for the hits and a predicted activity, if the
hypothesis has a QSAR model. </p>

<h3>Selecting a Structure Source</h3>

<p>The structures that are searched can come from a 3D database that is prepared
beforehand, from a file, or from the selected entries in the Project Table. You
can choose the structure source from the <span class="GUI">Search in</span>
option menu.</p>

<p>To specify which 3D database or file to use, you can either enter a file name
in the <span class="GUI">File name</span> text box, or click
<span class="GUI">Browse</span> and navigate to the desired database or file. If
the database is not available locally, you will have to enter the name, and you
should select <span class="GUI">Remote database</span>.</p>

<p>If you selected a 3D database, you can use the full set of structures or a
subset (if any are defined). To specify the subset, enter the name in the
<span class="GUI">Subset</span> text box, or click
<span class="GUI">Browse</span> and select the subset in the
dialog box that opens. You can enter the file name for a subset that does
not exist in the database, by specifying the path to the file, which must end in
<code>_phase.inp</code>, and can be either a local file or a remote file.</p>

<p>The structure source must consist of reasonable, all-atom 3D structures. The
search for matches also requires a set of conformers for each molecule, and site
points for each conformer. If the structure source does not have conformer sets,
or if you wish to regenerate them with a different conformational search,
you can generate them during the search by selecting the appropriate option in
the <span class="GUI">Searching</span> tab. </p>


<h3>Selecting a Hypothesis</h3>

<p>The hypothesis can be chosen from any of the hypotheses in the Project Table.
If you open this panel from the <span class="GUI">Score
Hypotheses</span> step or the <span class="GUI">Build QSAR Model</span>
step of the <span class="GUI">Build Pharmacophore Model </span> panel, the
selected hypotheses are added to the Project Table, and the first added
hypotheses is chosen as the default hypothesis. If you want to choose a
different hypothesis from the Project Table, click <span
class="GUI">Choose</span> and choose the hypothesis in the dialog box that is displayed. </p>

<p>If the hypothesis that you want to use is not part of the current project, you can
import it, provided that it was exported from the project in which it was
generated. To do so, click <span class="GUI">Import</span> to navigate to the
hypothesis and import it.</p>


<h3>Setting Matching Criteria</h3>

<p>When you search for matches to the hypothesis, you can set the tolerance for
matching intersite distances, apply tolerances for matching individual features,
set the number of site points that must match, select individual features that
must match, permit or prohibit matches to other features, geometrically
constrain matches, and apply excluded volumes.  These options are available in
or from the <span class="GUI">Matching</span> tab.</p>

<h3>Filtering the Matches</h3>

<p>The matches are filtered to generate a reduced list of hits, and properties
are calculated for these hits. There are several ways of filtering the matches
to obtain a list of hits:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Limiting the number of hits&mdash;You can limit the number of hits to a
given maximum, or limit them to a maximum number of hits per molecule in
the database. The matches that have the highest fitness score are returned as
hits.
</p></li>
<li><p>Applying scoring cutoffs&mdash;You can exclude matches that do not meet
cutoffs for the alignment score, the vector score, or the volume scores. This
feature can be used to ensure a minimum level of overlap and alignment with the
reference ligand.
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If the hypothesis has a QSAR model, you can calculate the activity from
this model by selecting <span class="GUI">Apply QSAR model</span>. You can also
customize the fitness score by adjusting the weights of the alignment, vector, and
volume scores. These options are available in the <span class="GUI">Hit
Treatment</span> tab.
</p>

<h3>Starting the Search</h3>

<p>To submit the search job, click <span class="GUI">Run</span>. If you want to
make host settings first, choose <span class="GUI">Job Settings</span> from the
<span class="GUI">Settings</span> button on the Job toolbar. You can select the
host and the number of CPUs to use in the dialog box that opens, and then either
just save the settings or save the settings and start the job.</p>

<p>If you are searching a database and the feature definitions of the hypothesis
do not match those of the database, a dialog box is displayed to allow you to
resolve the discrepancy. You can choose to rebuild the database with the new
feature definitions, which changes the database permanently, or you can
recompute the sites for the ligands in the database &quot;as needed&quot;, which
creates new site definitions for the duration of the job. If the database is not
accessible to Maestro, however, the feature definitions cannot be checked, and
the job fails if the feature definitions differ.
</p>

<p>Each time you search the database, the hits are added to the Project Table as
an entry group, where you can apply the full range of applications and
facilities available from Maestro to the hits. The fitness score and the
activity predicted by the QSAR model (if any) are added as properties, along
with a property that indicates which hypothesis was matched.</p>

<p>If you want to run the search from the command line, using the options you
set up in the panel, choose <span class="GUI">Write</span> from the <span
class="GUI">Settings</span> button on the Job toolbar. The input files and a
shell script to run the job are written to the current directory. You can then
use the files that are written out with <code>phase_find_matches</code>.
The shell script contains the command to be used to run the job, but the command
does not have Job Control options.</p>

<h2>Advanced Pharmacophore Screening Panel Features</h2> 


<p>The <span class="GUI">Advanced Pharmacophore Screening</span> panel consists
of a toolbar, a section to specify the structure source and the hypothesis, and
a set of three tabs for setting options for the search and the output.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#feature0">Toolbar</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature1">Structure and hypothesis selection section</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature2"><span class="GUI">Searching</span> tab</a></li>

<li><a href="#status_bar">Status bar</a></li>
</ul>


<a name="feature0"></a>
<h3>Toolbar</h3>

<p>The toolbar contains four buttons, three of which are the same as in the
<a href="develop_model.html"><span class="GUI">Develop Common Pharmacophore Hypotheses
</span> panel</a>, and allow you to view the selected
hypothesis and its excluded volumes, intersite distances, and angles.
The fourth allows you to view site-matching tolerances. 
</p>

<a name="feature1"></a>
<h3>Structure and hypothesis selection section</h3>

<p>At the top of the panel are controls for selecting the source of structures
to search and the hypothesis to match. </p>

<a name="feature1.5"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Remote database</span>
option</dt>
<dd><p>Select this option to use a database on a file system that is not
accessible to the local host. The full path to the database on the remote file
system must be entered into the <span class="GUI">File name</span> text
box. Checking of the database is not done until the job starts. You can specify
a subset with this option enabled, and the subset can be either local or remote.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature1.2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">File name</span> text
box and <span class="GUI">Browse</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Enter the name of the database or the file name in the text box, or click
<span class="GUI">Browse</span> and navigate to the file or database.
These controls are not available if <span class="GUI">Project Table
(selected entries)</span> was chosen from the <span class="GUI">Search
in</span> option menu.</p>
<p>When searching in a file, the file can be in Maestro or SD format, and can be
compressed with <code>gzip</code> (<code>.maegz</code>, <code>.mae.gz</code>, or
<code>.sdf.gz</code>) or uncompressed (<code>.mae</code>, <code>.sdf</code>)
</p></dd>

text box and <span class="GUI">Browse</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Enter the name of the subset of the 3D database to use, or click
<span class="GUI">Browse</span> and select one of the available
subsets in the dialog box that opens.
These controls are only available if <span class="GUI">3D
Database</span> was chosen from the <span class="GUI">Search
in</span> option menu. If the <span class="GUI">Subset</span> text
box is blank, the entire database is searched.
</p>
<p>You can enter the name of a subset file that is not included in the
database. The name must end in <code>_phase.inp</code>. The file need not exist
on the local file system: it can be on a remote host, such as the host where the
database is stored.
</p>
</dd>

<a name="feature1.4"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Hypothesis</span> text box and buttons</dt>
<dd><p>The hypothesis text box displays the entry ID and the hypothesis ID of
the hypotheses to which matches are sought.</p> 
<p><span class="GUI">Choose</span> button&mdash;Choose a hypothesis from the
Project Table. Opens a dialog box that displays a list of hypotheses.</p>
<p><span class="GUI">Import</span> button&mdash;
Import a hypothesis from a file. The feature definitions for the hypothesis
should match those in the database, if you selected a database for searching. If
they do not match, you can apply the new feature definitions to the database
when you run the search, either temporarily or permanently.

<h3>Searching Tab</h3>
<p>In this tab, you set options that affect the way the search is performed.
You can specify whether to use existing conformations or to generate them during
the search, and set options for each choice.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#feature2.1"><span class="GUI">Use existing conformers</span> option</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature2.2"><span class="GUI">Score in place</span> option</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature2.3"><span class="GUI">Refine matches</span> option</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature2.4"><span class="GUI">Generate sites during search</span> option</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature2.5"><span class="GUI">Perform pre-screen using database keys</span> option</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature2.6"><span class="GUI">Generate conformers during search</span> option</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature2.7"><span class="GUI">Conformer generation and refinement</span> section</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature2.8"><span class="GUI">Existing conformers</span> options</a></li>
</ul>

<dl>

<a name="feature2.1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Use existing conformers</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>With this option, the search is performed with existing conformers.  When
searching a file or Project Table entries, consecutive structures with identical
titles and connectivities are treated as conformers of a single molecule.
</p>

<dl>
<a name="feature2.2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Score in place</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Score structures without doing any alignment to the hypothesis. 
</p></dd>

<a name="feature2.3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Refine matches</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Generate extra conformers for the top-ranked match from each molecule
matched. These conformers are subjected to the hit filters and are returned in
the hit file. This procedure improves the fitness score, and can return matches
when excluded volumes eliminate every match for some molecules. When you select
this option, the <span class="GUI">Conformer generation and refinement</span>
section is activated, so you can set parameters for the extra conformers.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature2.4"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Generate sites during search</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Generate the sites during the search, rather than use preexisting
sites. You should select this option if the feature definitions for the
hypothesis differ from those in the database.  This option is only available if
you are searching a database, where the sites are already present. For other
input sources, sites are generated automatically. These sites are not saved, but
only used during the search.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature2.5"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Perform pre-screen using database keys</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Perform a pre-screening of the database using database keys, to speed up
the search. Use of these 3D keys rapidly filters out the majority of molecules
that cannot possibly match the hypothesis. This option is recommended except
when searching a small subset of the database or when the search is split across
a large number of CPUs.
</p></dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<a name="feature2.6"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Generate conformers during search</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>With this option, the conformers are generated as each structure is
read, and site points are generated automatically along with the conformers. 
When you select this option, the <span class="GUI">Conformer generation and
refinement</span> section is activated, so you can set parameters for the
conformational search.</p></dd>

<a name="feature2.7"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Conformer generation and refinement</span> section</dt>
<dd><p>In this section you can specify options for the conformational search
when generating conformers during the search or when refining matches by
generating extra conformers. 
</p></dd>

<dl>
<a name="feature2.8"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Existing conformers</span> options</dt>
<dd><p>These options allow you to discard the current conformer set (<span
class="GUI">Discard</span>) or keep it (<span class="GUI">Keep</span>, when
generating new conformers. If you keep the existing set, the new conformers are
appended to the set. The set might therefore contain redundant conformers, but
it is also guaranteed to contain the original structure.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature2.9"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Number of conformers per rotatable bond</span> text
box</dt> 
<dd><p>This text box specifies the maximum number of conformers to generate in
the conformational search for each rotatable bond in the structure. The
number given in the text box is multiplied by the number of rotatable bonds in
the molecule to arrive at the maximum number of conformers.  The default for
this value is 10.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature2.10"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Maximum number of conformers per structure</span> text
box</dt> 
<dd><p>This value limits the number of conformers returned from the generation
process. If the number of conformers generated is higher than this value,
a sample of all the conformers generated is returned. The default is 100. 
</p></dd>

<a name="feature2.11"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Sampling</span> options</dt>
<dd><p>The extent of the search depends on the sampling method as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Rapid</span>&mdash;
All the core conformations are generated, and the conformations
of the peripheral (rotamer) groups are sampled one by one.
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Thorough</span>&mdash;
A complete set of conformations is generated for both the core and the
peripheral groups.</p></li>
</ul>
</dd>

<a name="feature2.12"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Amide bonds</span> option menu</dt>
<dd><p>There are three options for treatment of amide bonds in the search:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="GUI">Vary conformation</span>&mdash;This option
allows the amide dihedral angle to be varied. It can take any value, not just
cis or trans.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Retain original conformation</span>&mdash;Retain the
conformation that was in the input structure.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Set to trans conformation</span>&mdash;Set the
conformation to trans for all amide bonds. </li>
</ul>
</dd>

<a name="feature2.13"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Relative energy window</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>In this text box you can set the an energy cutoff for eliminating
conformers that are too high in energy. Any conformer whose energy relative to
the lowest conformer exceeds this value is discarded.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature2.14"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Skip conformer generation for structures with &gt; <i>N</i>
rotatable bonds</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>If a structure has more than the specified number of rotatable bonds,
do not generate conformers for this structure. Conformer generation time
increases rapidly with the number of rotatable bonds, particularly for thorough
sampling.

<h3>Output option</h3>
<p>Below the tabs is an option for control of the amount of output. Selecting
the <span class="GUI">Verbose output </span> option provides details of each
match in the output file. By default, only one line is written per match. You
should only select this option if you are interested in the details of the
matching, as it could generate a large amount of output if there are many
matches.

<h3>Job toolbar</h3>
<p>The Job toolbar is used to make settings for a job and to start it. </p>

<dl>
<dt><span class="GUI">Job name</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>Enter a name for the job in this text box.
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Settings</span> button menu</dt>
<dd><p>This button opens the <a href="../misc/job_settings.html"><span
class="GUI">Job Settings</span> dialog box</a>. The arrow to the right opens
a menu, from which you can make settings or perform actions that are related to
the job. </p>
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/settings.png" />
<p>The menu items are described below.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="GUI">Job Settings</span>&mdash;Make and save settings for the
incorporation of the job into the Maestro project, the job name, the host,
the distribution of subjobs, and any other application-specific job settings.
Opens the <span class="GUI">Job Settings</span> dialog box.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Preferences</span>&mdash;Set general preferences for
running jobs. Opens the <span class="GUI">Preferences</span> panel at the <a
href="../maestro_menu/preferences.html#jobs_starting"><span class="GUI">Jobs - 
Starting</span> section</a>.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Write</span>&mdash;Write the input files for the job but do not start it. 
The file names are based on the current job name, and the files are written to
a subdirectory of the current working directory that is named with the job
name.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Job status</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>This icon indicates when there are jobs running for the application that
belong to the current project. It starts spinning when the first job starts, and
stops when there are no more jobs running. If a job fails to start, it changes
to an exclamation point. 
</p>
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/job_status.png" />
<p>
Clicking the button shows a small job status window that lists the job name and
status for all active jobs submitted from the current panel (for Jaguar and
MacroModel this means all jobs from any of the application panels). You can
double-click on a row to open the <a href="../misc/monitor_panel.html"><span
class="GUI">Monitor</span> panel</a> and monitor the job, or click the <span
class="GUI">Monitor</span> button to open the <span class="GUI">Monitor</span>
panel and close the job status window. The job status is updated while the
window is open. If a job finishes while the window is open, the job remains
displayed but with the new status.  The rows are colored according to the
status: yellow for submitted, green for launched, running, or finished, red for
incorporated, died, or killed.  Click anywhere outside the window to close it.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Run</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Run the job with the current job settings.
</p></dd>
</dl>


<a name="status_bar"></a>
<h3>Status bar</h3>
<p>The status bar displays information about the current job settings for the
panel. This includes the job name, task name and task settings (if any), number
of subjobs (if any) and the host name and job incorporation setting. It also
displays a message for a short time when you start a new job.</p>
<p>The status bar also contains the <span class="GUI">Help</span> button, which
opens the help topic for the panel.</p>
