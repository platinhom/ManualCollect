<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>The <span class="GUI">Entry Selection</span> dialog box enables you to
select entries in the Project Table based on a combination of criteria for
property values. This combination of criteria is called a <i>filter</i>.  Once
you have defined a set of criteria for selecting entries, you can store this set
of criteria as a named filter, and use the filter directly from the <span class="GUI">Select</span> menu in the <span class="GUI">Project
Table</span> panel.</p>

<p>The <span class="GUI">Entry Selection</span> dialog box is similar in
design to the <a href="../misc/asd.html">Atom Selection dialog box</a>. It
allows you to select entries using GUI tools rather than entering an
<a href="project_esl.html">ESL expression</a>.</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Entry Selection Dialog Box</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Entry Selection</span> dialog box, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Select &rarr; Only</span> 
in the <span class="GUI">Project Table</span> panel.
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Select &rarr; Add to selection</span> 
in the <span class="GUI">Project Table</span> panel.
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Select &rarr; Deselect</span> 
in the <span class="GUI">Project Table</span> panel.
</p></li>
<li><p>Click <span class="GUI">Select</span> in the 
<span class="GUI">Edit Filter</span> panel.</p></li>
</ul>


<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Entry Selection Dialog Box</h2> 


<p>The <span class="GUI">Entry Selection</span> dialog box allows you to
define a filter that can be applied to the entries in the project table.
The action taken depends on how you opened the dialog box.</p>

<p>The filter that you define can be a combination of individual filters.
To define a property filter, choose a property from the list in the <span class="GUI">Properties</span> tab, then select a criterion from the right
side of the tab, and, if appropriate, enter a property range or a string to
be matched. To combine this filter with the current filter definition, click
<span class="GUI">Add</span> to create a filter for entries whose properties meet
either the new criterion or the existing criteria, click
<span class="GUI">Remove</span> to create a filter for entries whose properties meet
the existing criteria but not the new criterion, or click
<span class="GUI">Intersect</span> to create a filter for entries whose
properties must meet both the existing criteria and the new criterion.
</p>

<p>Once you have defined a filter, you can create a named filter by clicking
<span class="GUI">Create Filter</span>. To apply the specified action and
dismiss the dialog box, click <span class="GUI">OK</span></p>

<a name="features"></a> 
<h2>Entry Selection Dialog Box Features</h2> 


<p>At the top of the entry selection dialog box is a title bar, which defines
the action to be taken when you click <span class="GUI">OK</span>. In the center
are two tabs, <span class="GUI">Properties</span> and <span
class="GUI">Filters</span>, that you use to define or choose filters for entry
selection. On the right are buttons for combining the new filter with the
current filter. These tools become available when you have selected a property
and a criterion for that property, or a named filter. In the lower portion of
the panel is an ESL text box and a set of buttons for editing the filter. </p>

<h3>Properties Tab</h3>

<p>The <span class="GUI">Properties</span> tab contains a <a
href="../project_facility/property_selection.html">property selector</a>, from which you can make a
selection, and a set of tools to define a criterion for the property that
entries must meet. The available criteria are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The property is defined.</li>
<li>For textual properties, the text matches a given string.</li>
<li>For numerical properties, the value lies in a given range.</li>
<li>For Boolean properties, the value is true or false.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the inclusion state and the selection state of the entry can be
selected as criteria.
The tools become available once you have selected a property, and vary
according to the kind of property. </p>

<p>To specify a range for a numerical property, you can use any of the following
operators:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td><tt>==&nbsp;</tt></td>
<td>(equals)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><tt>!=&nbsp;</tt></td>
<td>(is not equal to) </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><tt>&gt;&nbsp;</tt></td>
<td>(greater than) </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><tt>&gt;=&nbsp;</tt></td>
<td>(greater than or equal to)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><tt>&lt;&nbsp;</tt></td>
<td>(less than) </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><tt>&lt;=&nbsp;</tt></td>
<td>(less than or equal to)</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>or you can specify a range with a minus sign, such as <tt>1&nbsp;-&nbsp;3</tt>. There
must be a space on both sides of the minus sign.</p>

<a name="feature2"></a>
<h3>Filters Tab</h3>

<p>The <span class="GUI">Filters</span> tab contains a list of
already-defined filters that you can combine with the current entry selection to
define a new selection.
</p>

<a name="feature3"></a>
<h3>Combining Tools</h3>

<p>The combining tools are the three buttons to the right of the tabs. When
you have set up a criterion for a property or selected a filter, a new entry
selection is defined.  These tools combine the new selection with the current
selection, which is defined by the expression in the
<span class="GUI">ESL</span> text box.  </p>

<p><span class="GUI">Add</span> adds the new selection to the current
selection, using a logical OR operation on the ESL expressions. The resulting
selection includes all entries that are in the new criteria or the current
criteria.  This is the default action, which is performed if you press <span class="GUI">RETURN</span>.</p>

<p><span class="GUI">Remove</span> removes the new selection from the current
selection, using a logical AND NOT operation on the ESL expressions. If this is
the first operation, the default current entry selection is "all". The resulting
selection includes all entries in the current selection but not in the
new selection. </p>

<p><span class="GUI">Intersect</span> takes only the common members of the
new and current selections, using a logical AND operation on the ESL
expressions.  The resulting selection includes all entries that are in both the
new selection and the current selection. </p>

<p>In addition to these three buttons, the <span class="GUI">Invert</span>
button at the bottom of the panel inverts the entire current entry selection, using a
logical NOT operation.  All entries that were selected are unselected, and all
entries that were not selected are selected.</p>

<a name="feature4"></a>
<h3>ESL Expression and Editing Tools</h3>

<p>You can undo multiple operations with repeated clicks on the
<span class="GUI">Undo</span> button. The <span class="GUI">Redo</span>
button reverses undo operations, and can also be used multiple times.
You can also type ESL expressions directly into the ESL text box.
The hand-edited expressions are considered part of the last operation performed
with the mouse and can be undone and redone as part of that operation, but cannot
be undone or redone separately.</p>

<a name="feature5"></a>
<h3>Create Filter</h3>
<p>Once you have defined the criteria for selecting entries, the resultant ESL
expression can be stored as a filter. To create a filter, click
<span class="GUI">Create Filter</span>. The <span class="GUI">New
Filter</span> dialog box opens, in which you can provide a name to the new
filter. The newly created filter appears in the <span class="GUI">Filters</span>
tab of the <span class="GUI">Entry Selection</span> dialog box and on the
<span class="GUI">Filter</span> submenu of the <span class="GUI">Select</span>
menu in the <span class="GUI">Project Table</span> panel.
