<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>In this panel you can create a QSAR model for the activity as a function of
the kind of R-group at each attachment position, and display the results
qualitatively in terms of increasing the activity, decreasing the activity, or
little effect on the activity.
</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the E-State RQSAR Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">E-State RQSAR</span> 
panel:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Click <span class="GUI">E-State RQSAR</span> in the 
<span class="GUI">R-Group Viewer</span> panel.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the E-State RQSAR Panel</h2> 


<p>The QSAR model is built using counts of E-state (electrotopological state)
atom types present in the R groups at each position as the independent
variables. As the effect of hydrogen is absorbed into the attached E-state atom
type, the R group includes the attached core atom so that an R group consisting
of only a hydrogen can be treated.
</p>

<p>A partial-least-squares (PLS) procedure is used to fit the data, assigning 75%
of the data to the training set and 25% to the test set at random. The fitting
is repeated many times, each time picking the best model that does not  
overfit the data (which occurs when the standard deviation of the fit is smaller
than the error in the property being fit). The mean of the coefficients from all
of these trials is used to determine whether a feature at a given position
contributes significantly to the property, either positively or negatively: if
the absolute value of the mean is greater than the supplied cutoff, the
contribution is considered significant. </p>
<p>When the calculation finishes, the attachment positions are labeled with a
list of letters representing the E-state atom types, colored by significance: 
red for significant positive contributions, blue for significant negative
contributions, and gray for insignificant contributions. 
If an E-state atom type is absent from an attachment position, it is not
included in the annotation for that position.
</p>

<p>To generate a QSAR model:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose a property from the <span class="GUI">Property</span> option menu</li>
<li>Specify the error in the property in the <span class="GUI">Error</span>
box.</li>
<li>Specify the cutoff for significant contributions in the <span
class="GUI">Importance cutoff</span> box. </li>
<li>Click <span class="GUI">Start</span></li>

</ol>

<a name="feature1"></a>
<dt>Display area</dt>
<dd><p>Displays the core, annotated at each attachment point with the
E-state atom types and their contribution to the selected property.
The annotation consists of letters that represent the E-state atom types, which
are defined in the <a href="#key"><span class="GUI">Key to annotations</span>
section</a>. Features that were not found at a given attachment point are not
represented.
Features that have significant negative contributions to the property are
colored blue and placed on the left. Features that have significant positive
contributions to the property are colored red and placed on the right. Features
that have insignificant contributions are colored gray and placed in the middle.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Property</span> option menu</dt>
<dd><p>Choose the property used for the activity from this option menu. A
message is displayed to the right, indicating how many of the structures
analyzed have the selected property.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Error</span> option menu</dt>
<dd><p>Enter the estimated error in the values of the property in this box.  The
value can be derived however you like. It is used to check for overfitting in
the PLS procedure: the number of factors used is the largest number at which
standard deviation of the regression is larger than the error given in this
box. 
</p></dd>

<a name="feature4"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Importance cutoff</span> option menu</dt>
<dd><p>Specify the cutoff on the mean value of the PLS coefficient for 
an E-state atom
to be considered to significantly affect the predicted
property. The units of the cutoff are the same as those of the property.
</p></dd>

<a name="key"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Key to annotations</span> section</dt>
<dd><p>The key to the annotations is described in this section. 
The letters used to represent the atom types are listed with the names of the
atom types and the intrinsic E-state value (which increases with increasing
effective electronegativity).
The atom type names are represented by a string of bond types (s=single,
d=double, t=triple, a=aromatic), followed by an element symbol, then a hydrogen
count, then a letter that indicates the charge on the atom (p=plus,
m=minus). For example, aasC represents a carbon connected to other atoms by two
aromatic and one single bond, such as in biphenyl. dssNp represents a positively
charged nitrogen bonded with one double bond and two single bonds, such as in an
iminium group.
