<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Display information on protein-ligand interactions derived from a
simulation, in graphical form. The diagrams show RMSD and RMSF measures for
proteins, including backbone, side-chain, and secondary structure changes;
ligands, including internal and external motions; and  protein-ligand contacts,
including H-bonds, hydrophobic, ionic, and water-bridge contacts. 
</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Simulation Interactions Diagram Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Simulation Interactions Diagram</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Applications &rarr; More Applications &rarr; Desmond &rarr; Simulation Interactions Diagram</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
</ul>


<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Simulation Interactions Diagram Panel</h2> 


<p>The purpose of this panel is to display graphically information about the
behavior and interactions of proteins and ligands during the course of a
simulation. For example, you can examine to what extent a hydrogen bond between
a ligand and a protein residue is maintained during the simulation, whether the
ligand moves in and out of the binding site, what are the more rigid regions of
the protein and what are the flexible regions, how well is a water bridge
maintained, how flexible the ligand is in the binding site. This information
could be used to validate a ligand pose, or propose modifications to the ligand
or to the protein. 
</p>

<p>To generate the analysis data, you can click the <span
class="GUI">Load</span> button and select an output <code>-out.cms</code> file
that has an associated trajectory, and run the analysis. Once the analysis is
run, you can load the event analysis file (<code>.eaf</code>) and examine the
various graphical representations of the RMSD, RMSF, contacts, and torsions.
</p>

<p>You can create a PDF file that contains all the charts in the panel, along
with explanatory text, or you can export just the charts as images. You can also
export the data to a plain text file if you want to do your own analyses or
processing of the data.

<h3>Load button</h3>
<p>Load the results of an analysis of the simulation interactions, from an event
analysis file (<code>.eaf</code>), or load a simulation that has a trajectory
(<code>-out.cms</code> file) and run the analysis. When you load a simulation,
the <span class="GUI">SID Analysis Setup</span> dialog box opens, in which you
can specify ASL expressions that define the protein and the ligand, and select
the analysis types that you want to run. Clicking <span class="GUI">Run</span>
in the dialog box runs the analysis on the trajectory and loads the results. 
</p>

<a name="feature2"></a>
<h3>Generate Report button</h3>
<p>Generate output that contains the information in the panel in one or more
formats:
</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="GUI">PDF</span>&mdash;Generate a PDF file that contains the
diagrams with explanatory text.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Plots</span>&mdash;Save all the diagrams in the panel in

<a name="feature3"></a>
<h3>PL-RMSD tab</h3>

<p>This tab displays diagrams of the RMSD of selected protein and ligand
features with respect to a reference frame, as a function of simulation time.
The RMSD is calculated after superimposing the frame for a given time step on
the reference frame.
</p>

<a name="feature3.1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Show protein RMSD</span> options</dt>
<dd><p>Select the atom set for which to display plots of protein RMSD
values. There are four choices, <span class="GUI">C-alphas</span>, <span
class="GUI">Backbone</span>, <span class="GUI">Side chains</span>, and <span
class="GUI">Heavy atoms</span>. The superposition is done for the chosen atom
set, except that the backbone is used for superposition for side-chain
measurements. Each RMSD is plotted in a different color, shown
in the legend.</p>
<p>If the simulation has equilibrated, the protein RMSD should be fluctuating
around some thermal average, by around 1-3 &Aring;. If the RMSD is still
increasing or decreasing, the simulation has not equilibrated, and the
simulation may not be long enough for rigorous analysis.  Large changes in the
protein RMSD may indicate conformational changes. 
</p></dd>

<a name="feature3.2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Show ligand RMSD</span> options</dt>
<dd><p>Select an option for display of ligand RMSD plots. The two options
determine the atom set on which the frames are superimposed for measurement of
the RMSD. For <span class="GUI">Aligned on ligand</span>, the RMSD measures the
internal fluctuations of the ligand. A large change may indicate a ligand
conformational change. For <span class="GUI">Aligned on protein</span>, the RMSD
measures the fluctuations of the ligand with respect to the protein. Values that
are significantly larger than the protein RMSD may indicate that the ligand has
diffused away from its initial location.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature3.3"></a>
<dt>Current values display</dt>

<dt>Diagram</dt>
<dd><p>The plots of the RMSD as a function of simulation time are displayed in
this area. The legend for the various RMSD values is given at the top. When you

<h3>P-SSE tab</h3>
<p>This tab displays the secondary structure content of the protein as a
function of residue number and of time. The upper plot displays the percentage
of time each residue contributes to each of the three secondary structure
elements: strand, helix, and loop. The lower plots show the secondary structure
content as a function of time, as the total helix+strand (top) and as a function
of residue index (bottom).  
</p>

<p>To change the time range of the displayed results, click <span
class="GUI">Set Range</span> and set the lower and upper frame numbers in the
dialog box that opens. The current range is displayed to the left of the button
as a simulation time in ns.
</p>

<a name="feature4"></a>
<h3>P-RMSF tab</h3>
<p>This tab displays root-mean-square fluctuations (RMSF) for each residue in
the protein chain. The RMSF for the residues is the time-averaged fluctuation of
the square deviation of a designated set of residue atoms over the entire
simulation time, after superposition on the reference frame. Peaks indicate
areas of the protein that fluctuate most. These usually include the
termini. Helices or strands usually fluctuate less.
