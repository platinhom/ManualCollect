<p>The entries or surfaces in the Workspace can be arranged in a rectangular
grid of &quot;tiles&quot;, with each entry assigned to a tile. This operation is
called <i>tiling</i>, and is done by one of the following methods:
<ul>
<li><p>Press <span class="Keys">Ctrl+L</span> (<span class="Keys">&#x2318;L</span>).
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">View &rarr; Advanced View Options &rarr; Tile &rarr; Tile Workspace</span>.
</p></li>
<li><p>Click the <span class="GUI">Tile</span> button on the 
<span class="GUI">View</span> toolbar.
</p></li>
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/tile.png" />
</ul>

<p>There are three tiling modes, which can be selected from the 
<span class="GUI">Tile</span> button menu on the 
<span class="GUI">View</span> toolbar or the 
<span class="GUI">View &rarr; Advanced View Options &rarr; Tile</span> submenu.
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Tile by Entry</span>&mdash;This is the default mode, in
which each entry in the Workspace occupies a separate tile, except for fixed
entries, which are displayed in every tile.
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Tile by Entry Groups</span>&mdash;In this mode, all
entries that are in the same entry group are displayed in the same tile. This
mode allows you, for example, to display several proteins with their ligands in
the Workspace, and use the ePlayer to step through ligands for a given receptor.
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Tile by Surface</span>&mdash;In this mode, each surface
that is displayed in the Workspace is placed in a separate tile, along with the
corresponding structure. Surfaces for fixed entries are displayed in every tile,
and entries that are displayed in the Workspace that do not have surfaces are
displayed in their own tiles, at the end of the grid (i.e. they are treated as
having a single surface that is null). This mode allows you to display multiple
surfaces for a single entry in separate tiles, such as molecular orbitals or
SiteMap surfaces. 
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Tiles are initially displayed in the order in which the entries were included
in the Workspace. There are two ways of rearranging the tiles. The first is to
exclude an entry and then include it again. This entry is placed at the end of
the grid of tiles. The second is to move individual tiles. To move tiles, first
choose <span class="GUI">Move Tile to Picked Location</span> from the 
<span class="GUI">Tile</span> button menu, 
the <span class="GUI">View &rarr; Advanced View Options &rarr; Tile</span> submenu, or from the shortcut menu. 
Then click on a tile to select it for moving, and click on the desired new
location. As you move the pointer, the location where the selected tile will go
if you click in the current tile is marked by a purple line. The tiles between the
initial location and the final location are moved to fill the space left by
moving the selected tile, and the selected tile is placed in the new location.
When you have finished moving tiles, deselect 
<span class="GUI">Move Tile to Picked Location</span>.
</p>

<p>Each tile is a mini-Workspace, in which you can perform all the operations
that are available when the Workspace is not tiled. Transformations (rotation,
translation, zoom) can be performed on all tiles simultaneously, or on
individual tiles. To perform simultaneous transformations, select <span
class="GUI">Transform All Tiles</span> on the <span class="GUI">Tile
Entries</span> button menu. If you deselect this option, you can transform
individual tiles. Clicking in a tile selects the tile, which is marked by a
thicker border. To transform an individual tile, start the transformation
operation when the pointer is in the tile. You can drag outside the tile to
finish the transformation operation, but to start another operation on the same
tile, you must move the pointer back into the tile.
</p>

<p>To reset the view in each tile to the initial view, choose <span
class="GUI">Reset All Tiles</span> from the 
<span class="GUI">Tile</span> button menu on the 
<span class="GUI">View</span> toolbar or the 
<span class="GUI">View &rarr; Advanced View Options &rarr; Tile</span> submenu.
To reset the view in an individual tile, right-click in
the tile and choose <span class="GUI">Reset Tile</span> from the shortcut menu.
</p>

<p>To apply the view or zoom for an individual tile to all tiles, right-click in
the tile and choose <span class="GUI">Apply View to All Tiles</span> or <span
class="GUI">Apply Zoom to All Tiles</span> from the shortcut menu.
</p>
<p>Saving an image preserves the tiling of the Workspace in the image.
</p>

<p>Some actions do not behave the same in tile mode as out of tile mode. 
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Adding atoms in Draw or Place mode by clicking in an empty part of the
Workspace adds the atoms to the scratch entry. If the scratch entry is not in
the tile you clicked in, the atoms will not appear in that tile, but rather in
the scratch entry tile. If you draw or place atoms by clicking first on an
existing atom, the behavior is normal: atoms are added to the structure that you
clicked on. 
</p></li>
<li><p>Saving a view only saves the current global transformation, and does not
preserve changes made in individual tiles. Consequently, restoring a view
applies the same view to each tile, and does not preserve changes made in
individual tiles.
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>To undo the tiling of entries, you can use one of the methods you used for
tiling entries. Information on individual transformations is discarded when you
exit tile mode.</p>
