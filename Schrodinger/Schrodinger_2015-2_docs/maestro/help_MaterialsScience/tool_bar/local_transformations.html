<p>Local transformations are rotations and translations of a selected set of
atoms in the Workspace. In contrast to global transformations, which only change
the viewing angle of the Workspace, local transformations change the coordinates
of the selected atoms. 
</p>

<p>Like global transformations, local rotations and translations are done with
the middle (rotation) and right (translation) mouse buttons. 
You can switch between local and global transformation mode with 
<span class="Keys">Ctrl+G</span> (<span class="Keys">&#x2318;G</span>), 
or by choosing <span class="GUI">Edit &rarr; Transform &rarr; Pick to Transform</span>. 
You can switch modes temporarily by holding down the <span
class="Keys">Spacebar</span> while you perform the rotation or translation. When
you release the <span class="Keys">Spacebar</span>, the previous mode is
restored.
</p>

<p>For a quick local transformation, you can select the atoms in the Workspace,
then choose <span class="GUI">Transform</span> from the Workspace
<a class="glossary" href="../misc/glossary.html#shortcut_menu">shortcut
menu</a>, and perform the transformation. 
To exit the mode, press <span class="Keys">Ctrl+G</span> (<span class="Keys">&#x2318;G</span>).
</p>

<p>The tools for local transformations are available from the 
<span class="GUI">Transform</span> button menu on the 
<span class="GUI">Edit</span> toolbar.<br style="margin-bottom: 10px;" />
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/globallocal.png" />
<br style="margin-bottom: 10px;" />
This button menu has four groups of items: 
</p>
<p><b>Display Options:</b> 
There are two options in this group, <span class="GUI">Display
Interactions</span> and <span class="GUI">Display Bond Lengths</span>. 
The first displays interactions between the atoms being transformed and the
rest of the atoms in the Workspace. The types of interactions that are displayed
can be selected in the 
<a href="../maestro_menu/preferences.html#nonbonded_interactions_criteria"><span 
class="GUI">Non-bonded interactions &ndash; Criteria</span></a> section of the 
<span class="GUI">Preferences</span> panel.  
<span class="GUI">Display Bond Lengths</span> marks bonds between the
selected atoms and the other atoms with a dotted line and the length of the bond.
</p>
<p>The display options are saved as preferences and are applied whenever you
perform a local transformation.
</p>

<p><b>Picking Choices:</b> 
The five items in this section allow you to choose the object that you want
to perform a local transformation on: <span class="GUI">Atoms</span>, 
<span class="GUI">Residues</span>, <span class="GUI">Chains</span>, 
<span class="GUI">Molecules</span>, or <span class="GUI">Entries</span>. 
When you have selected one of these items, you can click on an atom in the
Workspace to select the object. Each click replaces the previous selection. You
can drag over multiple objects to select them. 
</p>

<p><b>Show Markers Option:</b>
With this option selected, the atoms selected for transformation are marked
in the Workspace in yellow.
</p>

<p><b>Advanced:</b> This item opens the 
<a href="advtransformations.html"><span class="GUI">Advanced
Transformations</span> panel</a>, which offers the full 
flexibility for performing local transformations. 
</p>
<a name="sculpting"></a>
<p>A special kind of local transformation that includes minimization is provided
with the <span class="GUI">Sculpt</span> button menu on the 
<span class="GUI">Build</span> toolbar.<br style="margin-bottom: 10px;" />
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/primex_sculpting.png" />
<br style="margin-bottom: 10px;" />
With this tool, moving the selected atoms is followed by a short force-field
minimization that includes nearby atoms. Once you enter this mode, you can
select atoms and drag them to a new location (with the left mouse button). When
you release the mouse button, the minimization starts. The selected atoms are
restrained. Atoms in the same residues have no constraints placed on them; atoms
in complete residues that are within 5&nbsp;&Aring; of these residues are
restrained, and all other atoms are frozen. The minimization proceeds for a
fixed number of cycles or until there is no significant change. During the
minimization you can continue to work on the structure. The minimization stops
if you exit the mode, for example by choosing some other action that involves
picking atoms, or change the content of the Workspace. If you select some more
atoms and drag them while the minimization is proceeding, it stops and a new
minimization begins.
