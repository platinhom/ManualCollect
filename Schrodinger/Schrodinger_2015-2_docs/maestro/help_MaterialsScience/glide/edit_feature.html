<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>The <span class="GUI">Edit Feature</span> dialog box allows you to
edit the feature that the ligand must match. Features are defined in terms of
SMARTS patterns. You can add patterns, edit and delete custom patterns, and you
can exclude patterns in a feature definition.</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Edit Feature Dialog Box</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Edit Feature</span> dialog box, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Click <span class="GUI">Edit Feature</span> in the 
<span class="GUI">Constraints</span> tab of the <span class="GUI">Ligand Docking</span> panel.</p></li>
</ul>


<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Edit Feature Dialog Box</h2> 


<h3>Loading and Saving Feature Sets</h3>

<p>Built-in feature sets are stored with the distribution.</p>

<p>You can import a feature set for the selected constraint from a file by
clicking <span class="GUI">Import</span>, and navigating to the
feature file. When you import a feature set, the definitions of all features
are replaced, not just the selected feature. The feature definitions are
replaced only for the selected constraint, but are replaced
for that constraint in all groups.</p>

<p>Feature sets can be saved to a file by clicking <span class="GUI">Export</span>, and specifying the file
location in the file selector that is displayed. </p>

<p>The patterns that define a feature are displayed in the
<span class="GUI">Pattern list</span> table when you choose the feature
from the <span class="GUI">Feature</span> option menu.</p>

<h3>Adding, Editing, and Deleting Patterns</h3>

<p>If the patterns in a given feature definition do not cover all the functional
groups that you want to include in the feature, you can add extra patterns. To
add a new SMARTS pattern, click the table row above which you want the pattern
to be inserted, then click <span class="GUI">New</span>. In the <a
href="new_pattern.html"><span class="GUI">New Pattern</span> dialog box</a>, you
can enter a SMARTS pattern and enter the atom numbers in the pattern that must
satisfy the constraint.</p>

<p>To edit a pattern, select the table row for the pattern, then click <span
class="GUI">Edit</span>. In the <a href="edit_pattern.html"><span
class="GUI">Edit Pattern</span> dialog box</a>, you can modify the SMARTS
pattern and the atoms in the pattern that must match.</p>

<p>To delete a pattern, select the table row for the pattern, then click <span
class="GUI">Delete</span>.</p>

<h3>Setting the Status of Patterns</h3>

<p>Matching of patterns to ligand structures is done in the order specified in the
<span class="GUI">Pattern list</span> table. You cannot change the
order of the patterns once they are in the table, so you must add new patterns
in the appropriate place. If you want to move patterns, you must delete them then
add them back in the appropriate place. Excluded patterns are processed first,
regardless of their position in the table.</p>

<p>If you want to ensure that certain functional groups are not matched, you can select
the check box in the <span class="GUI">Exclude</span> column for the
pattern for that group. For example, you might want to exclude a carboxylic acid
group from being considered as a hydrogen bond donor, because it will be ionized
under physiological conditions.</p>


<h3>Visualizing Patterns</h3>

<p>If you want to see a pattern for a given ligand or group of ligands, you
can select the check box in the <span class="GUI">Mark</span> column
for the pattern. Any occurrences of the pattern are marked in the Workspace.</p>

<h2>Edit Feature Dialog Box Features</h2> 


<ul>
<li><a href="#feature1"><span class="GUI">Feature</span> controls</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature2"><span class="GUI">Pattern list</span> table</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature3">Pattern editing buttons</a></li>
</ul>

<a name="feature1"></a>
<h3>Feature controls</h3>

<p>This section has three controls:</p>

<dl>
<dt><span class="GUI">Feature</span> option menu</dt>
<dd><p>Select a feature type. The selected feature type is assigned to the
constraint and appears in the <span class="GUI">Available constraints</span>
table of the <span class="GUI">Constraints</span> tab. The patterns
that define the selected feature type are listed in the 
<span class="GUI">Pattern list</span> table.
You must select a feature type to edit its definition. The available feature
types are:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="GUI">Acceptor</span>&mdash;Neutral or charged acceptor.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Charged Acceptor</span>&mdash;Acceptor that has a formal
charge. Includes O<sup>&minus;</sup>, S<sup>&minus;</sup>, F<sup>&minus;</sup>,
Cl<sup>&minus;</sup>.Both oxygens in a carboxylate are included as charged
acceptor atoms.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Neutral Acceptor</span>&mdash;Acceptor that does not have
a formal charge. Includes a range of groups containing N and O. </li>
<li><span class="GUI">Acceptor Including Halogens</span>&mdash;Neutral or
charged acceptor or a neutral halogen (F, Cl, Br, I).</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Donor</span>&mdash;Hydrogen attached to any neutral
nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur; also includes OH<sup>&minus;</sup></li>
<li><span class="GUI">Donor Including Aromatic H</span>&mdash;Donor as defined
above and any hydrogen attached to an aromatic carbon.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Donor Including Halogens</span>&mdash;Donor as defined
above and any neutral halogen other than F. Halogens can make nonbonded
interactions with acceptor groups.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Donor Including Aromatic H + Halogens</span>&mdash;Donor,
hydrogen attached to aromatic carbon, or halogen, as defined above.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Hydrophobic</span>&mdash;A range of patterns of aliphatic
and aromatic carbons, and neutral halogens other than F.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Custom</span>&mdash;Specify your own feature type by
defining SMARTS patterns that match the feature.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Import</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Opens a file selector in which you can browse for feature files.
 (Note: the feature file format changed for the 2014-3 release, so
feature files from earlier releases cannot be read in.)
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Export</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Opens a file selector in which you can browse to a location to write a
feature file.
</p></dd>

</dl>

<a name="feature2"></a>
<h3>Pattern list table</h3>
<p>The <span class="GUI">Pattern list</span> table lists all the patterns
that are used to define the feature. You can only select one row
at a time in the table, and the text fields are not editable. The table columns
are described below.
</p>

<dl>

<a name="feature2.1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Mark</span></dt>
<dd><p>Column of check boxes. Selecting a check box marks the pattern on any
structures that are displayed in the Workspace.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature2.2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Pattern</span></dt>
<dd><p>Pattern definition. The definitions are SMARTS strings.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature2.5"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Atoms</span></dt>
<dd><p>The list of atoms that must satisfy the constraint, numbered
according to the SMARTS string.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature2.6"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Exclude</span></dt>
<dd><p>Column of check boxes. If a check box is selected, atoms in a ligand are
matched by other patterns only if they do not match this pattern. This is
essentially a NOT operator. Excluded patterns are processed before other
patterns.
</p></dd>


</dl>

<a name="feature3"></a>
<h3>Pattern editing buttons</h3>

<dl>

<a name="feature3.1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">New</span> button</dt>

Pattern</span> dialog box</a>, in which you can edit the selected
pattern.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature3.3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Delete</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Deletes the selected pattern.
</p></dd>
