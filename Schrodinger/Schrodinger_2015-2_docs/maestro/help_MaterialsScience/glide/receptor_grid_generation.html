<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>The <span class="GUI">Receptor Grid Generation</span> panel is used to
specify a receptor structure and set up the grid generation job.  This job
creates the grid files, which represent the active site of the receptor for Glide
ligand docking jobs.</p>
<p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Receptor Grid Generation Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Receptor Grid Generation</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Applications &rarr; More Applications &rarr; CombiGlide &rarr; Receptor Grid Generation</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Applications &rarr; More Applications &rarr; Glide &rarr; Receptor Grid Generation</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
</ul>


<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Receptor Grid Generation Panel</h2> 


<p>Glide (Grid-based LIgand Docking with Energetics) searches for favorable
interactions between one or more typically small ligand molecules and a
typically larger receptor molecule, usually a protein. The shape and
properties of the receptor are represented on a grid by several different
sets of fields that provide progressively more accurate scoring of the
ligand poses. The options in each tab of the panel allow you
to define the receptor structure by excluding any cocrystallized ligand
that may be present, determine the position and size of the active site
as it will be represented by receptor grids, and set up Glide constraints.
Ligand docking jobs cannot be performed until receptor grids have been
generated.
</p>

<p>Receptor grid generation requires a &quot;prepared&quot; structure:
an all-atom structure with appropriate bond orders and formal charges.
In most cases, the preparation process can be performed automatically
using the <a href="../workflows/protein_preparation.html">Protein Preparation
Wizard</a>.
</p>

<p>With the prepared structure in the Workspace, use the <span
class="GUI">Receptor Grid Generation</span> panel to set up the receptor grid
generation job.  When you have completed your setup, you can click the <span
class="GUI">Settings</span> button in the lower left corner of the panel to open
the <span class="GUI">Receptor Grid Generation - Job settings</span> dialog
box.</p> 
<p>
As well as making standard job settings, you can set the directory in which to
save the grid files, by using the <span class="GUI">Directory for grid
files</span> text box and <span class="GUI">Browse</span> button. By default,
grid files are written to the current working directory. They are copied back
to this location from a temporary directory if the job is run on a remote
host. There are some restrictions on specifying the directory 
for grid files: the directory cannot be a relative directory of the form 
<code>../</code><i>mydir</i>, and the job must be run on the local host. </p>
<p>The <span class="GUI">Output</span> section also contains a <span
class="GUI">Compress</span> option, which can be used to compress the
grid-related files into a <code>.zip</code> archive. 
</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can choose <span class="GUI">Write</span> from the <span
class="GUI">Settings</span> button menu to write the input files without
starting the job. The files are written to the <i>jobname</i> subdirectory,
where <i>jobname</i> is the name of the job that you specify. Any settings from
the <span class="GUI">Job Settings</span> dialog box are used to write the files.
</p>

<p>To restore the default settings in all tabs, choose <span class="GUI">Reset
Panel</span> from the <span class="GUI">Settings</span> button menu.</p>

<h2>Receptor Grid Generation Panel Features</h2> 


<p>The <span class="GUI">Receptor Grid Generation</span> panel
contains five tabs, which are described in full in separate topics:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="grid_receptor.html"><span class="GUI">Receptor</span> tab</a>&mdash;
Use this tab to define the receptor (by identifying the Workspace ligand, if one
is present) and optionally to scale the van der Waals radii of receptor
atoms.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="grid_site.html"><span class="GUI">Site</span> tab</a>&mdash;
Use this tab to determine the position and size of the volume for which grids
will be generated, representing the active site of the receptor.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="grid_constraints.html"><span class="GUI">Constraints</span> tab</a>&mdash;
Use this tab to designate certain receptor atoms (positional/NOE, H-bond/metal
constraints) for ligand-receptor interactions that you
can then choose to require during docking jobs.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="grid_rotatable_groups.html"><span class="GUI">Rotatable
Groups</span></a> &mdash;
Use this tab to specify groups that should be treated as rotatable in the grid
generation. These groups are currently restricted to hydroxyls in Ser, Thr, and
Tyr, and thiols in Cys.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="grid_excluded_volumes.html"><span class="GUI">Excluded
Volumes</span></a>&mdash;
Use this tab to set up regions of space in which the ligand is penalized during
docking.
</p></li>
</ul>

<a name="job_toolbar"></a>
<p>The Job toolbar is used to make settings for a job and to start it. </p>

<dl>
<dt><span class="GUI">Job name</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>Enter a name for the job in this text box.
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Settings</span> button menu</dt>
<dd><p>This button opens the <a href="../misc/job_settings.html"><span
class="GUI">Job Settings</span> dialog box</a>. The arrow to the right opens
a menu, from which you can make settings or perform actions that are related to
the job. </p>
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/settings.png" />
<p>The menu items are described below.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="GUI">Job Settings</span>&mdash;Make and save settings for the
incorporation of the job into the Maestro project, the job name, the host,
the distribution of subjobs, and any other application-specific job settings.
Opens the <span class="GUI">Job Settings</span> dialog box.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Preferences</span>&mdash;Set general preferences for
running jobs. Opens the <span class="GUI">Preferences</span> panel at the <a
href="../maestro_menu/preferences.html#jobs_starting"><span class="GUI">Jobs - 
Starting</span> section</a>.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Write</span>&mdash;Write the input files for the job but do not start it. 
The file names are based on the current job name, and the files are written to
a subdirectory of the current working directory that is named with the job
name.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Reset Panel</span>&mdash;Reset the values in the panel to 
their defaults.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Job status</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>This icon indicates when there are jobs running for the application that
belong to the current project. It starts spinning when the first job starts, and
stops when there are no more jobs running. If a job fails to start, it changes
to an exclamation point. 
</p>
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/job_status.png" />
<p>
Clicking the button shows a small job status window that lists the job name and
status for all active jobs submitted from the current panel (for Jaguar and
MacroModel this means all jobs from any of the application panels). You can
double-click on a row to open the <a href="../misc/monitor_panel.html"><span
class="GUI">Monitor</span> panel</a> and monitor the job, or click the <span
class="GUI">Monitor</span> button to open the <span class="GUI">Monitor</span>
panel and close the job status window. The job status is updated while the
window is open. If a job finishes while the window is open, the job remains
displayed but with the new status.  The rows are colored according to the
status: yellow for submitted, green for launched, running, or finished, red for
incorporated, died, or killed.  Click anywhere outside the window to close it.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Run</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Run the job with the current job settings.
</p></dd>
</dl>


<a name="status_bar"></a>
<p>The status bar displays information about the current job settings for the
panel. This includes the job name, task name and task settings (if any), number
of subjobs (if any) and the host name and job incorporation setting. It also
displays a message for a short time when you start a new job.</p>
<p>The status bar also contains the <span class="GUI">Help</span> button, which
opens the help topic for the panel.</p>
