<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>This panel contains a simplified view of the Project Table that allows you to
perform basic operations such as selection and inclusion without having the full
Project Table present. 
</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Entry List Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Entry List</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Edit &rarr; Settings &rarr; Entry List</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Window &rarr; Show &rarr; Entry List</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
<li><p>Press  <span class="Keys">Ctrl+E</span> (<span class="Keys">&#x2318;E</span>) in the main window.
</p></li>
</ul>


<p>This panel is dockable, so it opens by default in the Workspace. You can
change this behavior in the <a href="../maestro_menu/preferences.html"><span
class="GUI">Preferences</span> panel</a>, under <span class="GUI">General
&ndash; Panels</span>.
</p>

<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Entry List Panel</h2> 


<p>This panel is intended to provide access to the basic features of the Project
Table in a lightweight panel, without having the full <span class="GUI">Project
Table</span> panel open. It can be docked into the Workspace, so you can easily
switch focus from the panel to the Workspace.
</p>
<p>You can step through the inclusion of entries in the Workspace with the <span
class="Keys">Left Arrow</span> and <span class="Keys">Right Arrow</span> keys.
Selection and inclusion is done in the same way as in the Project Table. You
can perform other operations from the shortcut menus. 
</p>
<p>To filter the list of entries shown, use the text box or the <span
class="GUI">Filter</span> button. Filtering the list merely hides rows: it does
not change the entry selection.
</p>

<a name="feature1"></a>
<dt>Search text box and <span class="GUI">Filter</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>The search text box and <span class="GUI">Filter</span> button allow you
to filter the list of entries that is shown in the entry list. Filtering this
list has no effect on the selection or the inclusion of the entries, or what is
visible in the Project Table.</p>
<p>To filter the list by title, enter the text to match in the text box. The
list is filtered as you type. The matching is case-insensitive. To clear the
text filter, click the <span class="GUI">Clear</span> (X) button. </p>
<p>You can also apply a global filter, by clicking the <span
class="GUI">Filter</span> button. The button is indented, to indicate that the
global filter is applied. To remove the global filter without removing the text
filter, click the button again. There are three ways of defining the global
filter, which you can set by clicking and holding on the button, then choosing
from the menu that is displayed.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="GUI">Included</span>&mdash;Show only the entries that are
included in the Workspace in the list.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Selected</span>&mdash;Show only the entries that are
selected in the Project Table in the list.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Filter</span>&mdash;Open the <a
href="../pt_select_menu/esd.html"><span class="GUI">Entry Selection</span>
dialog box</a> to define the filter in terms of entry properties or previously
defined filters. If you want to change the filter, you can select this item
again, even if it is already selected.</li>
</ul>
<p>Filters are reapplied whenever the Project Table changes. For example, if the
global filter is <span class="GUI">Selected</span>, and you deselect an entry,
it is removed from the list.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature2"></a>
<dt>Settings button</dt>
<dd><p>This button menu allows you to select a property to show, show the 
<span class="GUI">2D Structure</span> column, and fit the column widths to the
data, the header, or the larger of the two. Choosing <span class="GUI">Show
Property</span> opens a <a
href="../project_facility/property_selection.html">property selector</a> in
which you can select a single property to show in the entry list.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature4"></a>
<dt>Entry list</dt>
<dd><p>Lists the project entries, with the <span class="GUI">Row</span> column,
the <span class="GUI">In</span> column and the <span class="GUI">Title</span>
column displayed by default. For entry groups, the number of entries is shown to
the right of the title.  The entry list is kept synchronized with the Project
Table.</p>
<p>You can select multiple entries in the list with the usual shift-click and
control-click. If the list is filtered and you select with shift-click, only the
entries that are shown in the list are added to the selection. For entries that
are in between these entries but are hidden, the selection is not changed, so
selected entries remain selected, unselected entries are not selected. The same
applies to entry inclusion. If the list is filtered, only the entries that are
shown in the list are included in the Workspace. 
</p>
<p>Shortcut menus are displayed when you right-click on a row, so that you can
perform common operations, like Fix and Unfix, Duplicate, and so on. These menus
are the same as the menus that appear in the Project Table, with a few
exceptions. For an entry row, the 
<a href="../project_facility/project_table.html#feature4.1">Entry shortcut
menu</a> is shown, without the <span class="GUI">Copy Properties</span> and
<span class="GUI">Paste Properties</span> items; for an entry group row, the <a
href="../project_facility/project_table.html#feature4.3">Entry group shortcut 
menu</a> is shown, without the <span class="GUI">Edit Title</span> item. 
</p>
<p>The heading row has a reduced shortcut menu that allows you to show or hide
property columns, show the 2D structure, sort by a property value, add or remove
properties from the Workspace feedback, and set the column width.
</p>
</dd>

<a name="feature3"></a>
<dt>Project information</dt>
<dd><p>This area shows information on the entries and entry groups that are
present in the project, which filter (if any) has been applied to the entry
list, and how many entries are shown in the entry list after filtering.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature5"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Tips</span> text area</dt>
<dd><p>This area displays a list of suggestions for using the panel. 
</p></dd>
