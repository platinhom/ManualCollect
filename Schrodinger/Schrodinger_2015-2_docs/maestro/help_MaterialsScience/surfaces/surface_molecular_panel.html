<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>The <span class="GUI">Molecular Surface</span> Panel is used to generate
a surface that follows the molecular surface but is smoother than the CPK
surface.  The best known type is the Connolly surface.  Imagine rolling a ball
over the assembly of spheres constituting the vdW surface.  Where the outside of
the ball contacts the vdW spheres, the surfaces coincide.  But where two vdW
spheres come together, the Connolly surface follows the surface of the solvent
sphere, giving fillets rather than cusps where the vdW spheres intersect.
True Connolly surfaces are very expensive to generate, in general; therefore
often an approximation is used.  Note that changing the solvent sphere or <span
class="GUI"><a href="#feature4">probe radius</a></span> affects
the size and shape of the surface. </p>

<h2>Opening the Molecular Surface Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Molecular Surface</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Tools &rarr; Create and Manage Surfaces &rarr; Molecular Surface</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
</ul>

<dt><span class="GUI">Atoms for surface display</span> section</dt>
<dd><p>
The standard <a href="../misc/picking_controls.html">picking controls</a> in
the <span class="GUI">Atoms for surface display</span> section are used to
select the atoms for which the surface is displayed. The surface is generated
for the atoms specified in the <span class="GUI">Surface Context</span>
section. For example, if you select atom number 1 for surface display and choose
<span class="GUI">Entry</span> for the surface context, a surface for the
entire entry in which atom 1 resides will be generated, but only the part of the
surface that &quot;belongs&quot; to atom 1 will be displayed.  </p></dd>

<a name="feature3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Surface context</span> option menu</dt>
<dd><p>The options on the <span class="GUI">Surface context</span> option menu
determine which atoms are used to generate the surface. For the atoms chosen
in the <span class="GUI">Atoms for surface display</span> section,
you can generate a surface for the entry or the molecule that they belong to,
or just for the selected atoms (the default). If the entry or the molecule
contains more atoms than were chosen for surface display, the displayed surface
will be a partial surface.</p></dd>

<a name="feature4"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Surface resolution</span> option menu</dt>
<dd><p>The surface is created using interpolation on a cubic grid. This option
menu allows you to specify the resolution of the resulting surface.
Higher resolution means a smoother surface, which is slower to generate and draw.
Lower resolution means a rougher surface but is faster to generate and
and draw (and hence rotating will be faster). These controls
affect the grid spacing for the surface.
When you select <span class="GUI">Low</span>, <span class="GUI">Medium</span>,
or <span class="GUI">High</span>, the grid spacing in angstroms is displayed in
the text box. If you want to specify the grid spacing, choose 
<span class="GUI">Custom</span> and enter the desired value in the text box.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature5"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Probe radius</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>This text box specifies the radius of the probe that is to be rolled over
the van der Waals surface. The default solvent sphere or probe radius
of 1.4&nbsp;&Aring; corresponds to water. </p></dd>

<a name="feature7"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">VDW radius scale</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>Specify the scaling factor for the van der Waals radius.</p></dd>

<a name="feature2a"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Boolean operation</span> option menu</dt>
<dd><p>
Molecular surfaces can be created as a composite of two surfaces, by performing
a Boolean operation on the corresponding volumes. The available operations can
be chosen from this option menu:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="GUI">None</span>&mdash;Create a single surface (the default).</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Union</span>&mdash;Create a surface that encloses the
volume occupied by either of the two surfaces (logical OR).</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Intersection</span>&mdash;Create a surface that encloses
the common volume of the two surfaces (logical AND).</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Difference</span>&mdash;Create a surface that encloses the
volumes that are unique to each surface (logical XOR).</li>
</ul>
<p>When you choose an option other than <span class="GUI">None</span>, a
standard set of <a href="../misc/picking_controls.html">picking controls</a>
labeled <span class="GUI">Atoms for surface boolean operation</span> is
displayed below the option menu, which you can use to select the atoms for the
second surface.</p>

<a name="feature6"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Create Surface</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>This button starts the molecular surface
generation process using the settings from this panel. During this time
Maestro is inoperative and no user interaction is possible. Large-sized surfaces
or surfaces with fine grid spacing can take some time to generate.

<h2>Molecular Surface Background and Description</h2>

<p>In the ball-rolling description of an extended surface, the locus of
points described by the surface of the probe sphere closest to the
molecular system constitutes the molecular surface. The molecular
surface follows the van der Waals surface except where the surfaces
of two atomic spheres are closer together than a probe diameter.
In such regions (termed &quot;re-entrant&quot;), the molecular surface is
bridged over by a surface section that follows the probe surface.
The concept of molecular surface is usually associated with Connolly
(M.L. Connolly (1983) &quot;Analytical molecular surface calculation&quot;,
J. Appl. Crystallogr. 16, 548-558). However, Maestro does not use
Connolly's algorithm for producing the molecular surface. </p>

<p>The method used by Maestro to create the molecular surface is an
elaboration of what is sometimes called the &quot;ink-blot&quot; method. In the
ink-blot method, the volume enclosed by the extended surface is first
constructed. Then any points within this volume that lie interior to
the generating solvent probe are declared to be external. After this
process is complete, the boundary of the remaining internal volume is
the molecular surface. </p>

<p>Maestro first sets up the grid for the extended surface and interpolates
within it to produce the extended surface, as in the extended-surface
algorithm described above. Recall that interior grid points have values
less then unity and exterior points have values greater than unity.
These values are reset so that exterior points are given a value of zero
and interior points are given a value much greater than unity.  Then a
probe sphere is placed on each vertex of the extended surface in turn.
For each placement, for all grid vertices in the probe sphere's minimal
enclosing grid cube, the grid vertices are given the value Min(d/r,
previous_value). Outside the extended surface, the value will always
remain zero. Inside the extended surface, the value will rise from near
zero close to the probe center to somewhat greater than unity at the
grid cube boundaries. The vertices of the molecular surface are then
created by interpolation to unity on the grid. </p>

<p>The molecular surface appears from the outside to closely resemble the
van der Waals surface, since it follows the van der Waals surface,
except for the bridging re-entrant portions. We mentioned earlier
that interior atoms of an extended surface are buried (have no surface
points on their atomic spheres), but that few, if any, atoms are buried
in this sense for a van der Waals surface.  Atoms that are buried in an
extended surface will also be buried in a molecular surface, since no
atomic sphere will have molecular surface points on it unless the atom
is adjacent to a region in which a probe molecule will fit. Thus, in
their tendency to bury atoms, molecular surfaces resemble extended
surfaces rather than van der Waals surfaces. </p>
