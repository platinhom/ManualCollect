<p>Calculating a reaction enthalpy involves calculations on each of the
individual molecules in the reaction, then taking the difference. Jaguar
provides a convenient way of doing this calculation directly. In the <span
class="GUI">Jaguar - Reaction</span> panel, you can specify the reactant and
product molecules, and Jaguar performs all the individual calculations and then
calculates the reaction enthalpy.
</p>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Reaction</span> panel, choose 
<span class="GUI">Tasks &rarr; Quantum Mechanics &rarr; Reaction</span>.
The <span class="GUI">Jaguar - Reaction</span> panel opens with the <span
class="GUI">Reaction</span> tab displayed. This tab is used to choose the
structures for the reaction.  
</p>
<p>The <span class="GUI">Reaction</span> tab has two sections, one for reactants
and one for products. Each section shows the structures, in separate
boxes. Initially there is only one box in each section and they are empty. To
add a reactant or a product structure to a box, click in the box and choose the
source of the structure: 
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Import from Project Table</span>&mdash;import the structure
from the Project Table. A <span class="GUI">Choose Entry</span> dialog box
opens, so you can choose the entry.  
</p></li>
<li><p>Import from File&mdash;import the structure from a Maestro file. If the
file has more than one structure, only the first is imported.
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When the structure is imported, a 2D image is displayed in the box, and is
labeled <span class="GUI">Reactant</span> <i>N</i> or <span
class="GUI">Product</span> <i>N</i>. To display the structure in the Workspace,
click in the box.
</p>
<p>To add another reactant or product, click the + button to the left of the
first box in either section. Another box is displayed, and you can add a
structure to it. The boxes are numbered sequentially. To delete a reactant or
product, right-click in its box and choose <span class="GUI">Delete</span> from
the shortcut menu. To clear the entire panel and start over, click the arrow for
the <span class="GUI">Settings</span> button (gear icon at the lower right of
the panel) and choose <span class="GUI">Reset Panel</span>. 
</p>
<p>To display all the structures in the Workspace, click <span class="GUI">Tile
in Workspace</span>. Each structure is shown in a separate tile, labeled with
the entry title and the structure label (which is stored as the <span
class="GUI">Jaguar Reaction ID</span> property in the project). See 
<a href="../tool_bar/tileentries.html">Tiling Entries</a> for more information
on tiles and their features.
</p>
<p>When you have chosen all the structures, you should check that the
stoichiometry is correct, otherwise the job will fail.
</p>
<p>You can set the charge, spin multiplicity, symmetry use, and basis set for
each structure in the <span class="GUI">Molecules</span> tab. Choose the
structure from the option menu at the top right, then make the settings. Make
sure that you choose the same basis set for each molecule, and that the charge
and spin multiplicity is consistent between reactants and products. The job will
fail if any inconsistency is detected.
</p>
<p>The <span class="GUI">Properties</span> tab provides two options: one to
calculate &Delta;G and &Delta;H, and one to pre-optimize the geometries of all
the structures. If you choose to calculate &Delta;G and &Delta;H, a frequency
calculation is performed for each structure.
</p>
<p>The remaining tabs allow you to control the theoretical method, SCF
parameters, and solvent, and choose properties to calculate for each
molecule. These tabs are described in separate topics.
</p>
<p>When you have made all the settings, you can run the job. The structures are
incorporated as new entries in the project, with their properties. In addition,
the &Delta;E, &Delta;G and &Delta;H values for the reaction are added as
properties of the structures, if calculated.
