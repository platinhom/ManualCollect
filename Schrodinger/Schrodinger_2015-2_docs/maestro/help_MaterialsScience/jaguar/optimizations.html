<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
To perform a geometry optimization, you need a guess at the geometry and the
direction in which to search, a set of coordinates to optimize, and some
criteria for when the optimization is complete. The search direction is obtained
from the gradient of the energy and the initial Hessian. The general settings
for geometry optimizations are in the <span class="GUI">Optimization</span>
tab of the <span class="GUI">Jaguar</span> panel.</p>

<p>Jaguar can use several coordinate systems for the geometry optimization
parameters: Cartesian coordinates, Z-matrix coordinates, or redundant internal
coordinates. The last of these is the default, and is usually the best
coordinate system for the optimization. You should use redundant internal
coordinates unless you have a good reason not to. </p>

<p>Jaguar also provides several choices for the initial Hessian. The default
Schlegel guess is usually sufficient for most optimizations. If the molecule has
unusual features or is a floppy molecule, you can compute an accurate Hessian at
the beginning of the optimization, or read it in. </p>

<p>For large molecules, especially if there are low-frequency vibrational modes,
convergence can be slow. It is often useful to optimize the molecule in stages,
with parts of the molecule frozen. You can freeze as many coordinates as you
wish, and you can also apply dynamic constraints, in which a target value is set
for a particular coordinate that is achieved at convergence. Dynamic constraints
on a coordinate are useful when a change in the coordinate value to a fixed
value would cause unfavorable interactions in other parts of the molecule, or
would prevent the optimization from proceeding to the minimum.

<h2>Running Geometry Optimizations</h2>

<p>To set up a geometry optimization from Maestro, choose
<span class="GUI">Tasks &rarr; Minimization &rarr; Ab Initio QM</span>, 
<span class="GUI">Tasks &rarr; Quantum Mechanics &rarr; Optimization</span>, or 
<span class="GUI">Applications &rarr; Jaguar &rarr; Optimization</span>.
</p>

<p>In the <span class="GUI">Optimization</span> tab, you can set
parameters for the maximum number of steps in the geometry optimization, the
convergence accuracy, and you can choose an initial Hessian and a coordinate
system. If you do not need to add constraints, once you have made these
settings, and any settings in the other tabs, you can
click <span class="GUI">Run</span> to start the job with the current job
settings.</p>

<p>You can add constraints with the controls in the
<span class="GUI">Add New Constraint</span> section, by picking
atoms in the Workspace to define the coordinates.</p>
<ol>
<li>
Choose the coordinate type - <span class="GUI">Angle</span>,
<span class="GUI">Cartesian</span>, <span class="GUI">Dihedral</span>, or
<span class="GUI">Distance</span> - from the
<span class="GUI">Type</span> option menu.
</li>
<li>Choose <span class="GUI">Atoms</span> or
<span class="GUI">Bonds</span> from the <span class="GUI">Pick</span>
option menu
</li>
<li>
Pick the required number of atoms or bonds in the Workspace to define the
coordinate.
</li>
</ol>
<p>The coordinate and its type is listed in the
<span class="GUI">Constraints</span> table. If you choose
Cartesian, you can choose which combination of coordinates (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>,
or <i>z</i>) to freeze from the <span class="GUI">Constrain in</span>
option menu. For protein dihedral angles, you can also select one of the
standard angles by clicking <span class="GUI">Dihedral</span> and
selecting the desired angle in the
<a href="../edit_menu/dihedral_selection.html">Dihedral Selection</a> dialog
box.</p>

<p>Distance, angle, and dihedral constraints are added as internal coordinates
to a <b>coord</b> section, with a # sign to indicate that the coordinate is
frozen. Cartesian coordinate constraints are added to the <b>zmat</b> section,
by adding a # sign after the constrained coordinates. </p>

<p>To make a constraint in the <span class="GUI">Constraints</span> table
dynamic, select the table row, then select <span class="GUI">Dynamic</span>
in the <span class="GUI">Selected constraint</span> section next to the
table and enter the value that you want the constraint to converge on in the
<span class="GUI">Target value</span> text box. This value is copied to the
<span class="GUI">Target</span> column of the table, and added to
the variable definition in the coord section. </p>
