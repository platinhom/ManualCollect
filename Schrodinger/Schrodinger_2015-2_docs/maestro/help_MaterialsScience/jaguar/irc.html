<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Intrinsic Reaction Coordinate (IRC) calculations can be used to check that the
given transition state is the expected transition state for the reaction of
interest. IRC calculations start at a transition state and move downhill in
energy along the reaction path toward a minimum of the potential energy surface,
calculating a series of points in which all geometric variables orthogonal to
the path are optimized. The calculations can run in the forward direction
(toward the products) and the backward direction (toward the reactants).</p>

<p>As a fixed number of points is calculated, the end points (the reactant or
the product complex) might not be reached. However, it should be clear from
comparing the structures at the furthest point along the path with the input
complexes whether the end points of the IRC path do indeed correspond to the
reactant and product complexes. If they do not, then you may have the wrong
transition state. For example, butadiene has two transition states: one for
cis-trans isomerization, and one for cyclization. If you have the wrong
transition state for cyclization, the IRC path will not lead to the cyclic
structure.</p>

<p>
The scan can proceed along either the intrinsic reaction coordinate or the
minimum energy path (MEP). The difference between the two is that the reaction
coordinate for the IRC path is mass-weighted, whereas the reaction coordinate
for the minimum energy path is not.
</p>

<p>When the calculation is finished, the structures at the IRC (or MEP) points
are automatically incorporated as separate entries in the Project Table, and the
reaction coordinate is incorporated as a property. You can then sort the entries
based on this property, and display them in sequence using the ePlayer.</p>

<p>In an alternative (and less expensive) approach, the first point in each
direction of the scan is calculated, then the geometry obtained for each of
these points is optimized to find a minimum, without the constraint to the
reaction path. Although the relaxing of the constraint means that the minimum is
not guaranteed to lie on the reaction path, it will usually not deviate much
from the path unless there are other valleys on the potential energy surface
that it has access to. This is a quicker method of verifying the transition
state than a full IRC or MEP calculation. (This approach can be requested by
setting
<code>three_pt_irc=1</code> in the <b>gen</b> section in an IRC calculation.)

<h2>Running IRC Scans</h2>

<p>To set up an IRC or MEP calculation from Maestro, you must first perform a
transition-state calculation and read in the restart file, then choose
<span class="GUI">Tasks &rarr; Quantum Mechanics &rarr; Reaction Coordinate</span>.
</p>

<p>The calculation requires an accurate Hessian for the transition state. You
can either precalculate the Hessian and read it in from the restart file, or
make the calculation of the Hessian part of the IRC or MEP calculation. This
choice can be made from the <span class="GUI">Initial Hessian</span> option
menu in the <span class="GUI">Optimization</span> tab: to read the
Hessian, choose <span class="GUI">Other</span>; to calculate the Hessian,
choose <span class="GUI">Quantum-mechanical</span>. Do not use any of the
other options from this menu, because it is important to have an accurate
Hessian.</p>

<p>If you expect the IRC path to break symmetry, you should turn symmetry off in
the <span class="GUI">Molecule</span> tab. Symmetry is automatically
turned off if you calculate the Hessian as part of the job.  </p>

<p>You can choose the directions in which the scan proceeds from the
<span class="GUI">Direction</span> option menu in the
<span class="GUI">IRC</span> tab. The direction is determined
by the reactant and product geometries, which you can set in the
<span class="GUI">Structures</span> section. If you do not specify these
structures, Jaguar applies some rules to determine the reaction path. See the
<i>Jaguar User Manual</i> for details. You can also set the number of steps and
the step length.
</p>

<p>If you want an MEP scan rather than an IRC scan, deselect
<span class="GUI">Use mass-weighted coordinates</span>.</p>

<p>When you have finished making settings, start the job.
