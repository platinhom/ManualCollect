<p>Noncovalent interactions are particularly important in biological
chemistry. The binding of ligands to a receptor is usually via noncovalent
interactions such as hydrogen bonding, pi-pi stacking, pi-cation interactions,
and even halogen bonding. These weak interactions and their existence can be
explored with the help of the electron density, via noncovalent interaction
plots.
</p>

<p>How do we know when there is a bond? For a normal, covalent sigma bond, we
usually consider that there is a maximum in the electron density along the line
that joins the two atoms in the bond. As we walk along this <i>bond path</i>
(which need not be exactly straight) from one atom to the other, the electron
density decreases along this line to some minimum, then increases
again. Perpendicular to the line, the electron density decreases in any
direction. This means that the gradient of the electron density is zero
perpendicular to the bond path, and is also zero at one point along the path,
where it stops decreasing and starts increasing again. This point is a
&quot;critical point&quot; in the electron density. All covalent bonds have such
a <i>bond critical point</i>, and this point has maxima in the two (orthogonal)
directions perpendicular to the bond path and a minimum along the bond path.
(Mathematically, it is a second-order saddle point, with two negative
eigenvalues and one positive eigenvalue of the matrix of second derivatives of
the density).
</p>

<p>The same is true for weak interactions. Bonding occurs because the electron
density increases between the bonded atoms. Hydrogen bonds have a bond critical
point. Pi-pi interactions can have more than one bond critical point. For
example, the pi-pi interaction between two benzene molecules has two bond
critical points, between the 2 and 6 carbons of one ring and the 3 and 5 carbons
of the other.
</p>

<p>There are other kinds of critical points as well. Consider going along the
line from the 1 carbon to the 4 carbon in a benzene ring. The density decreases
to the middle, then increases again. The same is true for any other pair of
carbons on opposite sides of the ring. However, if we go out from the middle of
the ring in either direction perpendicular to the ring, the density
decreases. The density gradient in the middle of the ring is another critical
point, a <i>ring critical point</i>. This point has minima in two (orthogonal)
directions across the ring and a maximum in the third direction perpendicular to
the ring (it is a first-order saddle point, with one negative eigenvalue and two
positive eigenvalues of the matrix of second derivatives of the density). A ring
critical point exists if a hydrogen bond completes the ring, such as in the case
of 3-hydroxypropanal. The location of the ring critical point depends on the
strength of the bonds in the ring: it is closest to the weakest bond. So the
distance between the ring critical point and the bond critical point of the
weakest bond is a measure of the strength of the bond. The two points annihilate
each other if the bond disappears.
</p>

<p>As you might guess, there are two other kinds of critical points. One is a
maximum in all three (orthogonal) directions: this critical point defines the
position of an atom, where the density is a maximum at the nucleus. The
remaining critical point is a minimum in all three directions. This kind of
critical point occurs in a caged structure, like cubane. If you traverse a line
that goes through the center of the cage in any direction &mdash; from opposite
atoms, or from the midpoint of the bonds on opposite sides, or even the midpoint
of the faces of the cube &mdash; the density goes up from the center of the
cage. This is called a <i>cage critical point</i>.
</p>

<p>The interpretation of the critical points is only valid at the equilibrium
geometry, where there are no net forces. Away from the equilibrium, critical
points still exist (they must), but they don't necessarily provide the kind of
information that we want about the bonding.
</p>

<p>Jaguar (and QSite) can create surfaces that enclose these critical points. It
calculates the density, the (reduced) density gradient, and the density second
derivatives on a grid, and locates regions that contain the critical points. To
visualize noncovalent interactions (NCI), you can filter out the points at higher
densities, so that only those for lower densities are mapped. To set up a
calculation, you should do a geometry optimization. In the same calculation, you
can choose <span class="GUI">Surfaces</span> in the <span
class="GUI">Properties</span> tab, and select <span class="GUI">Noncovalent
interactions</span> in the <span class="GUI">Surfaces</span> section. When the
results are imported into Maestro, you should map the strength volume onto the
reduced gradient surface in the <span class="GUI">Surface Display Options</span>
dialog box. The <span class="GUI">Red-White-Blue</span> color ramp is a good
choice for this surface: the red regions contain bond critical points, the blue
regions contain ring critical points. In addition to the surfaces, the bond
critical points are identified and marked with dummy atoms. The bond paths to
the bonded atoms are represented by zero-order bonds. You can display and
undisplay them with the Maestro command <code>[un]display (atom.mtype
Z0)</code>, which you can type into the <span class="GUI">Commands</span> text
box.
</p>

<p>NCI plots can help resolve questions about whether bonding interations truly
exist between atoms that are not considered to be covalently bound to each
other.  Hydrogen bonds, for example, are known to be dependent upon both the
H-acceptor atom distance and the donor-H-acceptor angle.  When these parameters
are far from ideal, one may question whether a bonding interaction truly exists.
In other cases, a pi-pi interaction between aromatic rings may be controversial
because the rings are tilted with respect to one another, or a halogen-oxygen
bond may be disputed because the X-O distance is so large.  When a bonding
interaction truly exists between atoms, a bond critical point forms between
them, and this information appears in an NCI plot as a small isosurface of low
density gradient colored to show that the interaction is favorable.
</p>
<p>When there is a single bonding interaction between two molecules, as in the
hydrogen bond in the water dimer, an NCI plot shows a single isosurface.  In
contrast, an NCI plot of a ligand in the active site of an enzyme shows many
isosurfaces.  Because a ligand in an enzyme active site is an atomically crowded
system, and because the ligand usually makes several bonding interactions with
its environment, you often see ring and cage critical points in addition to bond
critical points, and these add to the complexity of the plots.  Ring critical
points form inside any closed loop of bond paths.  In symmetrical rings like
benzene, the ring critical point is in the center of the ring.  But if one bond
in the ring is weaker than the others, as in the case of an intramolecular
hydrogen bond, the ring critical point is off-center and closer to the critical
point in the weak bond.  The weaker this bond is, the closer the ring and bond
critical points are to each other.  Sometimes you see that a ring and bond
critical point are close enough together that they appear in the same
isosurface.  In this case, part of the isosurface will be colored to show the
favorable interaction indicated by the bond critical point, while the rest of
the isosurface will be colored to show the unfavorable interaction indicated by
the ring critical point.
