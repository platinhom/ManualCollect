<p>Information and instructions on editing a workflow in KNIME so that it can be
run from Maestro are given here. You must start the editing process from Maestro
by choosing
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Workflows &rarr; KNIME Workflows &rarr; New</span>
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>because this action runs KNIME from a script that performs the necessary
processing to create the Maestro interface after saving the workflow.
</p>


<p><b>Summary:</b>
</p>
<ol>
<li>Import or build a new workflow in the KNIME workspace.</li>
<li>Edit the Reader, Writer, and Quick Form node names to configure them for
input, output and parameter passing.</li>
<li>Rename your workflow without spaces.</li>
<li>Save it and close KNIME.</li>
<li>Test it in the startup panel and install it in Maestro.</li>
</ol>

<p><b>Detailed instructions:</b>
</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Import or build a new workflow in the KNIME workspace.</p>
<p>Use <span class="GUI">File &rarr; Import</span>, select a source and the
workflow to import a workflow.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Edit the node name of the Reader, Writer and Quick Form nodes that you
want to use to transfer information from or to Maestro.</p>
<p>The name must contain specific phrases, as described under <a href="#nodenames">Supported node names</a>, below. For example,
selected entries from the Maestro Project Table will be passed to a Molecule
Reader node that has &quot;Selected entries&quot; in its name. 
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Add a description of the workflow to the Comments field in the Meta
information. (In the Workflow Projects panel, right-click on the workflow name
and select <span class="GUI">Edit Meta Information</span>.)</p>
<p>The description is displayed in the panel that is created for the workflow.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>(Optional) Reset the workflow before saving it so as to keep its size
to the minimum. (Right-click on the first node of the workflow and select <span
class="GUI">Reset</span>.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Close your workflow. (Use the tab at the top of the workspace).</p>
<p>If you have unsaved changes, you will be prompted to save them.
</p></li>
<li><p>Rename your workflow. (Right click on the workflow name in the Workflow
Project list and choose <span class="GUI">Rename</span> to rename it.)</p>
<p>The workflow must not have spaces in the name, but these can be replaced with
underbars (_). This is the name listed in Maestro under <span
class="GUI">Workflows &rarr; KNIME Workflows</span>, with any underbars replaced
by spaces.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Close KNIME. (<span class="GUI">File &rarr; Exit</span>.)</p>
<p> A startup panel is created for the workflow, and is opened so you can check
the input, output, and parameters, test the workflow, and install it in Maestro.
For instructions, see <a href="knime_new_workflow.html">KNIME Workflow Panel
(New Workflow)</a>
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Install the workflow. (Click <span class="GUI">Install</span> in the
startup panel.)</p>
<p>When the workflow is installed, a message is displayed. Dismissing this
dialog box also closes the startup panel. The workflow is listed in Maestro
under <span class="GUI">Workflows &rarr; KNIME Workflows</span> from where you
can run it or modify it again in the KNIME GUI.</p>
</li></ol>

<h4>Supported node names</h4>

<p>Communication between Maestro and KNIME is set up by adding special text to
the names of Molecule Reader, Molecule Writer, CSV Writer, and Quick Form
nodes. This text identifies the node as one that can receive input from Maestro
or send output to Maestro. The text that you can use for this purpose in these
nodes is given in the table below.
</p>
<p>Structural input and output is handled with Molecule Reader and Molecule
Writer nodes. You can configure the Molecule Reader nodes with any file for
testing the workflow. These file names will be replaced when running the
workflow.
</p>
<p>Setting of variables or choice of options is handled with Quick Form
nodes. These nodes are used to add GUI controls to the panel that is created for
running the workflow. The GUI controls are presented in the panel in order of
the Weight value that you assign when you configure the node.
Using Quick Form nodes, you can set integer and real (double) variable values
and string values. To set a Boolean variable, you must use a String Radio
Buttons node with the values <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> (case insensitive).</p>
<p>
If you want to use multiple Quick Form nodes for input to a particular node, you
can string them together (connect the flow variable output from one to the flow
variable input from the next). After connecting the (last) Quick Form node to
the flow variable input of the node whose variables you want to set, configure
that node to associate the desired flow variables from the node with the ones
you set in the Quick Form nodes.
</p>
<p>If you want to execute Maestro commands after the structures are added to the
Project Table, use a CSV Writer node with the text <code>Maestro commands</code>
in the node name. The commands must be contained in the first column of the
input table, one command per row. You must deselect <span class="GUI">Write
column header</span> when configuring the node. For Maestro command syntax, see
the <a href="../../maestro_command_reference.pdf" target="pdfmanuals">Maestro
Command Reference Manual</a>.</p>
<p>
To display results you can also use a CSV Writer node, with the text
<code>Maestro message</code> in the node name. The table of results is displayed
in an information box, which opens when the node is executed.
