<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Generate new ligand structures from a set of aligned ligands by swapping
groups whose bonds overlap. Multiple rounds (&quot;generations&quot;) of
swapping can be made to generate new molecules in which multiple groups have
been swapped with other molecules.</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Breed Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Breed</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Tools &rarr; Scripts &rarr; Fragments &rarr; BREED</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Using the Breed Panel</h2> 


<p>The BREED algorithm (<i>J. Med. Chem.</i> <b>2004</b>, <i>47</i>,
2768&ndash;2775) generates new ligand structures from a supplied set of
ligands. The ligands must be all in the same frame of reference, which can be
achieved, for example, by aligning the binding sites of protein-ligand
complexes, or from docking runs. The alignment is necessary for the algorithm,
as it allows the identification of groups that are bonded in the same spatial
location to the ligand core, and can be considered candidates for swapping. 
</p>
<p>A group from one ligand can be swapped with a group from another ligand if
the bond to the group in the first ligand overlaps with the bond to the group in
the second ligand. The bonds are considered to overlap if the angle between the
two bonds is less than a specified maximum value and the atoms at each end of
the bond in the first ligand are no further away from the corresponding atoms in
the second ligand than a specified maximum value. Further constraints are that
the bond is of the same order, and that it is not in a ring. 
</p>
<p>A new pair of molecules is produced for each overlapping bond in each input
pair of molecules, with elimination of duplicates. This means that each new
molecule has had only one group swapped. This constitutes one
&quot;generation&quot; of swapping. In the next generation, the output molecules
from the first generation are used as input, to produce structures with two
swapped groups, and so on. You can specify the number of generations, which
should be no more than the maximum number of overlapping bonds.

<a name="feature3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Maximum atom-atom-distance</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>Specify the maximum distance between the atoms at each end of an
overlapping bond. If bond A&ndash;B in the first structure overlaps with bond
C&ndash;D in the second structure, the distance between A and C and the distance
between B and D must be less than the specified value.

<dd><p>Specify the number of rounds (generations) of swapping of groups to
perform. In each generation, a swap is made for each overlapping bond in each
pair of molecules, to produce a pair of structures for each swap. The results
are used as input to the next generation, to produce molecules with groups from
multiple original source molecules. The maximum number of generations that can
create new structures is equal to the maximum number of overlapping bonds in the
original structures. The number of generations is restricted to 1 or 2.

<dt><span class="GUI">Job name</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>Enter a name for the job in this text box.
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Settings</span> button menu</dt>
<dd><p>This button opens the <a href="../misc/job_settings.html"><span
class="GUI">Job Settings</span> dialog box</a>. The arrow to the right opens
a menu, from which you can make settings or perform actions that are related to
the job. </p>
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/settings.png" />
<p>The menu items are described below.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="GUI">Job Settings</span>&mdash;Make and save settings for the
incorporation of the job into the Maestro project, the job name, the host,
the distribution of subjobs, and any other application-specific job settings.
Opens the <span class="GUI">Job Settings</span> dialog box.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Preferences</span>&mdash;Set general preferences for
running jobs. Opens the <span class="GUI">Preferences</span> panel at the <a
href="../maestro_menu/preferences.html#jobs_starting"><span class="GUI">Jobs - 
Starting</span> section</a>.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Job status</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>This icon indicates when there are jobs running for the application that
belong to the current project. It starts spinning when the first job starts, and
stops when there are no more jobs running. If a job fails to start, it changes
to an exclamation point. 
</p>
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/job_status.png" />
<p>
Clicking the button shows a small job status window that lists the job name and
status for all active jobs submitted from the current panel (for Jaguar and
MacroModel this means all jobs from any of the application panels). You can
double-click on a row to open the <a href="../misc/monitor_panel.html"><span
class="GUI">Monitor</span> panel</a> and monitor the job, or click the <span
class="GUI">Monitor</span> button to open the <span class="GUI">Monitor</span>
panel and close the job status window. The job status is updated while the
window is open. If a job finishes while the window is open, the job remains
displayed but with the new status.  The rows are colored according to the
status: yellow for submitted, green for launched, running, or finished, red for
incorporated, died, or killed.  Click anywhere outside the window to close it.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Run</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Run the job with the current job settings.
</p></dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<a name="status_bar"></a>
<dt>Status bar</dt>
<dd><p>The status bar displays information about the current job settings for the
panel. This includes the job name, task name and task settings (if any), number
of subjobs (if any) and the host name and job incorporation setting. It also
displays a message for a short time when you start a new job.</p>
<p>The status bar also contains the <span class="GUI">Help</span> button, which
opens the help topic for the panel.</p>
