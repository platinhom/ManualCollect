<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
In this tab you can set options to select the best reagents at each position,
based on the GlideScore for either the single side-chain results or the
combinatorial results. The selection strategies fill a list of reagents at each
position by adding reagents one at a time, until the conditions on each list or on
the library size are met. In each strategy, the reagents are ordered according
to some criterion that is based on the GlideScore for the docked molecules.

<h3>Maximum Library Size Text Box</h3>

<p>Enter the maximum number of compounds you want in the final combinatorial library.
</p>

<a name="feature2"></a>
<h3>Selection Strategy Options</h3>

<p>Selection strategies can be applied to the single side chain docking results, or to
the combinatorial docking results.
</p>
<dl>

<a name="feature1.1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Single position</span></dt>
<dd><p>This option selects reagents based on the single-position docking results. For
each position, reagents are added in order of GlideScore, until the conditions on the
minimum and maximum reagents at each position and on the maximum library size
are met. </p>
<p>This is the only option available if you do not have combinatorial docking results.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature1.2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Combinatorial</span></dt>
<dd><p>This option selects reagents based on the combinatorial docking
results. There are two strategies:</p>
<dl>
<dt><span class="GUI">GlideScore</span></dt>
<dd><p>In this strategy, reagents are added to the list for each position in order
of the GlideScore. For each molecule, starting from the best, the reagent at
each position is added to the list for that position, unless it is already in the
list. The addition of reagents continues until the conditions on the minimum and
maximum reagents at each position and on the maximum library size are met.</p>
<p>Once the maximum number of reagents for a given position has been reached, there
are two options for adding reagents to the other positions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For each molecule considered, add reagents for that molecule to the unfilled
lists regardless of whether the filled lists contain the reagents at the
&quot;filled&quot;positions.
With this option, the combinatorial library does not include the
molecules for which reagents were added after one or more lists was filled.
To use this option, deselect <span class="GUI">Guarantee inclusion
in library</span>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>For each molecule considered, add the reagents for that molecule to the
unfilled lists only if the the filled lists contain the reagents at the
corresponding positions. With this option, the combinatorial library is
guaranteed to contain the molecules used to fill the reagent lists. To use this
option, select <span class="GUI">Guarantee inclusion
in library</span>.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The <span class="GUI">Guarantee inclusion in library</span> option
is only available if you have entered one or more maximum numbers in the
<span class="GUI">Restrictions</span> table.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Boltzmann</span></dt>
<dd><p>In this strategy, the Boltzmann population for each docked molecule is
calculated and normalized, treating the GlideScore as a free energy. The populations
are summed for each reagent that occurs in the docked molecules. The reagent
populations are converted to a relative GlideScore using a free-energy
relation. For each position, the list of reagents is filled, starting from the
reagent with the lowest relative GlideScore (highest population), until the
conditions on the minimum and maximum reagents at each position and on the
maximum library size are met.

<h3>Restrictions Table</h3>
<p>This table lists restrictions on the minimum and maximum number of reagents
for each attachment position. You can edit the <span class="GUI">Min</span> and <span class="GUI">Max</span>
columns to specify the minimum and maximum numbers of reagents at each
position.
