<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
In this step you select a molecule that is used as a &quot;core&quot; structure
and choose the reagents that are used to vary the side chains of the core structure.
</p>


<a name="working"></a> 
<h2>Working in the Define Combinations Step</h2> 

<p>To perform combinatorial screening, you must have a core molecule whose
side chains, or <i>attachments</i>, you want to replace, and a set of reagent
files that define the replacements. For information on preparing reagent files, see the
<a href="reagent_preparation.html">Reagent Preparation Panel</a>
topic. The core structure must be a 3D, all-atom, properly minimized structure.
</p>

<p>When you first enter the <span class="GUI">Define Combinations</span>
step, <span class="GUI">Pick molecule</span> is selected in the
<span class="GUI">Core structure</span> section, and most other
controls are unavailable. After you have defined a core structure, the other
controls become available.</p>

<p>Once you have defined a core structure and its attachments, click
<span class="GUI">Next</span> to continue to the next step.</p>

<p><b>To define the core structure:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Ensure that the structure is displayed in the Workspace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click on an atom in the core structure.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>After you pick the core structure, <span class="GUI">Pick
molecule</span> is deselected, and the
<span class="GUI">Pick</span> option is selected in the <span class="GUI">Pick to define an attachment</span> section. The core
molecule is now defined, and you can define the positions of the
attachments.</p>

<p><b>To define an attachment:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Pick two atoms in the core molecule that define the position of an attachment,
the atom that is kept first, then the atom that is deleted.</p>
<p>A turquoise arrow is displayed over the bond, and the
<span class="GUI">Select Reagent File</span> dialog box opens.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>Select the appropriate reagent file, and click <span class="GUI">OK</span></p>
<p>The reagent files have a <code>.bld</code> extension: they are
Maestro-format files that have special information for the Maestro builder,
which does the library enumeration. The dialog box closes, and the
attachment is listed in the <span class="GUI">Attachments</span>
table. The size of the library with the current set of attachments is given in
the lower portion of the panel. The arrowhead changes to a sphere and the color
changes to gold.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you choose the wrong location for an attachment, you can delete it by
selecting it in the table and clicking <span class="GUI">Delete
Attachment</span>. If you simply attached the wrong file, you can select the
attachment in the table, and click the <span class="GUI">Browse</span> button below the table to select the
correct file.</p>

<p>For each attachment a <i>minimal capping group</i> is automatically
defined. This minimal capping group is attached to the core at its attachment point
in place of what is in the actual core structure when the core structure is
docked. You can view the <i>minimally capped core</i> by selecting
<span class="GUI">Minimally capped core</span> from the
<span class="GUI">View as</span> options. To return to
the original core structure, select <span class="GUI">User-capped
core</span>.</p>

<h3>Core structure section</h3>

<p>This section provides controls for selecting and viewing the core molecule.
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#feature1.1"><span class="GUI">Pick molecule</span> option</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature1.2"><span class="GUI">Display Core Structure</span> button</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature1.3"><span class="GUI">View as</span> options</a></li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<dl>

<a name="feature1.1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Pick molecule</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>When selected, this option allows you to pick a molecule in the Workspace for the core
structure. The molecule you pick should be a 3D, minimized structure.
Picking a core molecule deletes any attachment data.
This option is selected by default when you open the panel and no core molecule
has been picked. After picking, the Workspace is cleared and the picked molecule
is displayed. This molecule is copied into the CombiGlide run. Any changes you
make to the <i>structure</i> of the molecule are not saved in the run.
If you make changes to the structure, you must pick the molecule again to make
it the core structure.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature1.2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Display Core Structure</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Redisplays the core structure in the Workspace.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature1.3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">View as</span> options</dt>
<dd><p>These options control the display of the core structure. The options are
<span class="GUI">Minimally capped core</span> and
<span class="GUI">Original core</span>, which have the obvious actions.
</p></dd>

<h3>Library definition section</h3>

<p>This section provides controls for the definition of attachment points and
selection of reagent files that will be used to enumerate the library.

below. You can select multiple rows in the table. Right-clicking in a table row
displays a menu with four items:
<span class="GUI">Select Reagent File</span>,
<span class="GUI">Clear Reagent File</span>,
<span class="GUI">Reagent File Statistics</span>, and
<span class="GUI">Delete Attachment</span>. The actions are applied
to all selected rows. The <span class="GUI">Reagent File
Statistics</span> item displays statistics on the selected reagent files. The
other items perform the same actions as the
<span class="GUI">Browse</span>,
<span class="GUI">Clear</span>, and
<span class="GUI">Delete Attachment</span>
buttons.

selected, the grow bond for each attachment is displayed in the Workspace.
The bond is a turquoise arrow before the reagent file is selected,
