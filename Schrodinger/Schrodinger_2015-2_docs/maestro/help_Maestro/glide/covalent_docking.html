<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Dock a set of ligands to a receptor, in which the ligands form a covalent
bond to a receptor residue or site by a specified type of reaction (such as a
Michael addition). The ligands must all contain the reactive group, which is
specified by a SMARTS pattern.
</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Covalent Docking Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Covalent Docking</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Applications &rarr; Glide &rarr; Covalent Docking</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
</ul>


<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Covalent Docking Panel</h2> 


<p>Covalent docking has two main goals:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Locate the best docked pose for each ligand and rank the poses for each
ligand by energy.</li>
<li>Rank ligands according to the ability of the ligand to bind noncovalently in
a suitable pose for reaction to form a covalent bond.</li>
</ul>
<p>The ligands must be a series of related compounds, all of which react with
the receptor at the same site and by the same mechanism. Use of covalent docking
to compare different mechanisms or different types of compound will not produce
meaningful results. 
</p>

<p>The covalent docking process has several stages:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Dock the ligands into noncovalently bound poses that are suitable for
covalent bond formation. To allow for different possible conformations of the
side chains of the reactive residue, it is mutated to alanine in this stage. This
removes any bias towards a particular ligand conformation that would occcur if
the side chain were regarded as fixed. The ligands are docked with Glide,
subject to constraints between the attachment atoms on the receptor and the
ligand.
</p></li>
<li><p>Form the bond between the receptor and the ligand. First, the reactive
residue side chain is restored, and its rotamers are sampled to find the best
conformation for each ligand pose. The bond is then formed and poses are
discarded if the ligand-receptor bond is too long. The ligand and reactive
residue, now covalently bound, are then minimized and the poses clustered. 
</p></li>
<li><p>Minimize and rank the poses. After clustering, a representative pose is
selected from each cluster, and the poses are minimized with Prime. The poses for
each ligand are then ranked by the Prime energy.
</p></li>
<li><p>Score poses for the affinity of the ligand to the receptor for
noncovalent binding prior to reaction. Ligands that do not score well are
considered less likely to approach the receptor in a way that permits covalent
bond formation. In this stage, the bond is broken again, the reactive receptor
residue is mutated to alanine, and the bond to the ligand is capped with
hydrogen. Scoring is then done with Glide, and the affinity is reported as the
average of the pre-reacted and post-reacted GlideScore for a given pose. 
</p></li>
</ol>
<p>There is also a virtual screening mode, in which rotamer sampling and
minimizations are not performed, and ligand sampling is reduced.
</p>

<p>To set up a covalent docking run, you must have a receptor that is prepared
for modeling and a set of prepared ligands that all have the required functional
group for reaction. It is recommended that you use the <a
href="protein_preparation.html">Protein Preparation Wizard</a> for preparing the
protein, and <a href="../ligprep/ligprep.html">LigPrep</a> to prepare the
ligands. You might also have to filter the ligands to ensure that they all have
the required functional group, which you can do in the <a
href="../tools_menu/ligfilter.html"><span class="GUI">Ligand Filtering</span> 
panel</a>. With these structures available, the process for setting up a default
job is described in the steps below.
</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Open the <span class="GUI">Covalent Docking</span> panel.
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose the source of ligands from the <span class="GUI">Use ligands
from</span> option menu, and if using a file, specify the file.
</p></li>
<li><p>Display the receptor in the Workspace and choose the reactive residue:
in the <span class="GUI">Receptor</span> tab,
select <span class="GUI">Pick</span> and pick a residue in the Workspace.</p> 
<p>The reactive residue must be of the correct type for the desired reaction&mdash;see
the <a href="#feature3.1">table</a> below for a list of allowed residues.
</p></li>
<li><p>Define the center of the grid box for the Glide docking.</p>
<p>If you want to define the center with a ligand, you must include the ligand
in the Workspace. 
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose the reaction type: in the <span class="GUI">Reaction
Type</span> tab, select a reaction from the <span class="GUI">Reaction
type</span> option menu. 
</p></li>
<li><p>(Optional) Edit the SMARTS pattern for the ligand reactive group, and add
SMARTS patterns, or import a set of SMARTS patterns defined previously.</p>
<p>The default SMARTS pattern is generic and minimal, and might match groups on
your ligands that you do not want to consider. Editing the default pattern and
adding other patterns allows you more control over the matching.  It may be
useful to have a ligand displayed in the Workspace on which you can select atoms
for the SMARTS pattern that define the functional group.
</p>
<p>To edit or add SMARTS patterns, click <span class="GUI">Edit</span>
or <span class="GUI">New</span>, and modify the SMARTS pattern directly, 
or pick atoms in the Workspace to define the group and click 
<span class="GUI">Get From Selection</span>. Choose an atom in the SMARTS
pattern from the <span class="GUI">Position</span> option menu as the reactive
atom, and click <span class="GUI">OK</span>. When you have edited the default
pattern, you can add more patterns.
</p></li>
<li><p>In the <span class="GUI">Docking</span> tab, choose a docking
mode: <span class="GUI">Pose prediction</span> for the most thorough treatment,
or <span class="GUI">Virtual screening</span>, for a faster treatment that can
be used on thousands of ligands.</p>
<p>The virtual screening mode leaves out most of the minimization and
conformational searching, and is at least 10 times faster. Pose prediction mode
can take an hour or two per ligand.
</p></li>
<li><p>Specify the number of output poses per ligand that you want returned.
</p></li>
<li><p>Start the job.</p>
<p>The process can take several hours per ligand. You should therefore consider
distributing the job over multiple processors, which you can do by clicking the
<span class="GUI"> Job Settings</span> button (gear icon) and choosing the host,
the number of processors, and the number of subjobs. The number of subjobs
should not be greater than the number of ligands.
</p></li>

</ol>
<p>The results of a covalent docking run are the covalently bound poses in a
Maestro file. Each pose has three main properties associated with it: the
affinity score, the Prime energy of the pose, and an index that identifies the
reactive site on the ligand if the ligand has more than one such site. Since
comparing poses is only meaningful for poses bonded at the same site, you can
use the index to select and compare poses for a particular site.

<h3>Reaction Type tab</h3>
<p>The task in this tab is simple: choose a reaction type for the
formation of the covalent bond between the ligand and the receptor. The reaction
type defines the functional group on the ligand, the allowed residue types in
the receptor with which the ligand can react, and the operations that must be
performed on the structures to create the covalent bond. The reaction types, the
ligand functional groups in terms of a SMARTS pattern, and the allowed residue
types are given in the table below. The notation R-SH,OH means one of six
residues with an SH or OH bond: CYS, SER, THR, ASP, GLU, TYR.
</p>
<p>If you want to investigate some other reaction type, you must have a custom
chemistry file, which defines all the required quantities. You can make your own
custom chemistry file using the procedure described in the <i>Covalent
Docking</i> manual. This feature allows you to specify a reactive site on the
receptor other than a standard residue, for example. 
</p>
<p>The ligands are automatically analyzed for matches to the SMARTS patterns
when any change is made to the reaction type or the SMARTS patterns. This
process is fast, but a warning is posted if you have more than 1000 ligands. A
progress bar is displayed for the analysis.

this reaction, and import it using the <span class="GUI">Custom chemistry

formation and further refinement. The default is 2.5 kcal/mol.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature5.3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Max number of poses to retain for further refinement</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>Maximum number of Glide poses to keep for covalent bond formation and
further refinement. The default is 200. 
</p></dd>

<a name="feature5.4"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Minimization radius</span> option and text box</dt>
<dd><p>Select this option to refine other protein residues as well as the ligand
and the reactive residue before clustering. Residues that have any atoms within
the specified distance of any atom in the ligand or reactive residue are
included in the minimization.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature5.5"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Calculate affinity score using Glide</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Calculate a noncovalent binding affinity score using the results of Glide
docking and a score-in-place calculation using the final docked pose. The
average of the two GlideScore values is used for the affinity. This option is
selected by default.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature5.6"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Perform MM-GBSA scoring</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Score the final docked pose using Prime MM-GBSA, to produce a binding
affinity. Note that this binding affinity does <i>not</i> include the covalent
binding: it is the noncovalent binding of the capped final pose to the mutated
receptor. This option is not selected by default.
</p></dd>

<h3>Job toolbar</h3>
<p>The Job toolbar is used to make settings for a job and to start it. </p>

<dl>
<dt><span class="GUI">Job name</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>Enter a name for the job in this text box.
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Settings</span> button menu</dt>
<dd><p>This button opens the <a href="../misc/job_settings.html"><span
class="GUI">Job Settings</span> dialog box</a>. The arrow to the right opens
a menu, from which you can make settings or perform actions that are related to
the job. </p>
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/settings.png" />
<p>The menu items are described below.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="GUI">Job Settings</span>&mdash;Make and save settings for the
incorporation of the job into the Maestro project, the job name, the host,
the distribution of subjobs, and any other application-specific job settings.
Opens the <span class="GUI">Job Settings</span> dialog box.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Preferences</span>&mdash;Set general preferences for
running jobs. Opens the <span class="GUI">Preferences</span> panel at the <a
href="../maestro_menu/preferences.html#jobs_starting"><span class="GUI">Jobs - 
Starting</span> section</a>.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Write</span>&mdash;Write the input files for the job but do not start it. 
The file names are based on the current job name, and the files are written to
a subdirectory of the current working directory that is named with the job
name.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Job status</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>This icon indicates when there are jobs running for the application that
belong to the current project. It starts spinning when the first job starts, and
stops when there are no more jobs running. If a job fails to start, it changes
to an exclamation point. 
</p>
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/job_status.png" />
<p>
Clicking the button shows a small job status window that lists the job name and
status for all active jobs submitted from the current panel (for Jaguar and
MacroModel this means all jobs from any of the application panels). You can
double-click on a row to open the <a href="../misc/monitor_panel.html"><span
class="GUI">Monitor</span> panel</a> and monitor the job, or click the <span
class="GUI">Monitor</span> button to open the <span class="GUI">Monitor</span>
panel and close the job status window. The job status is updated while the
window is open. If a job finishes while the window is open, the job remains
displayed but with the new status.  The rows are colored according to the
status: yellow for submitted, green for launched, running, or finished, red for
incorporated, died, or killed.  Click anywhere outside the window to close it.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Run</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Run the job with the current job settings.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<a name="status_bar"></a>
<h3>Status bar</h3>
<p>The status bar displays information about the current job settings for the
panel. This includes the job name, task name and task settings (if any), number
of subjobs (if any) and the host name and job incorporation setting. It also
displays a message for a short time when you start a new job.</p>
<p>The status bar also contains the <span class="GUI">Help</span> button, which
opens the help topic for the panel.</p>
