<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The <span class="GUI">R-Group Analysis</span> panel identifies the groups
that are attached to a core and provides tools for displaying properties of the
R groups and for exporting them to files. The core can be taken from CombiGlide
attachment bond labeling, specified by a SMARTS pattern, or determined by the
maximum common substructure obtained from a Canvas MCS run.
</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the R-Group Analysis Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">R-Group Analysis</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Tools &rarr; R-group Analysis</span> in the main window.
</p></li>
<li><p>From the command line, enter the following command:</p>
<p><code>$SCHRODINGER/run r_group_analysis.py</code></p>
</li>
</ul>

<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the R-Group Analysis Panel</h2> 

<p>When using SMARTS or CanvasMCS to define a core, the resulting R groups may
be surprising. Some of the situations that can arise are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>R groups attached with multiple bonds: Carbonyl is an example. These are
displayed in the viewer as expected.</p></li>
<li><p>R groups attached in multiple positions (forming rings): An R group
connected at multiple attachment points is displayed in the fragment viewer for
each attachment position. At each position, the attachment bond is displayed
with the same orientation and color shown for the corresponding attachment bond
on the core and the other fragments in the current fragment display. The
additional attachment bonds on the fragment are displayed with colors
corresponding to those shown in the core display, but their orientations might
not match those in the core display.</p></li>
<li><p>Attachment points on the core that, for some input structures, have no R
groups at all. An example is a furan oxygen which, in another input structure,
has a substituted carbon in the corresponding position. If the furan structure
is shown in the core display, a dummy atom is added to the furan oxygen to
enable a marker arrow denoting the attachment bond to be drawn. The dummy atom
is displayed as "Null".</p></li>
<li><p>Attachment bonds within a ring. An example is two attachment bonds within
a ring pointing toward the same ring atom. This means that the discovered MCS
includes the remaining ring atoms; the atom pointed toward is not part of the
core, but is a multiply connected R group.</p></li>
</ul>

<dl>

<a name="feature0"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Analyze structures from</span> option and menu</dt>
<dd><p>Select this option to analyze structions, and choose the source of
structures to analyze from this option menu. The available sources are: 
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Project Table (selected entries)</span>&mdash;Use the 
structures that are selected in the Project Table. Not available from the
command line.
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">File</span>&mdash;Use the structures in a specified
file. If you choose this option, the <span class="GUI">File name</span> text box
and <span class="GUI">Browse</span> button become available. 
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you select this option, the <span class="GUI">View Results</span> and
<span class="GUI">Save Results</span> buttons are unavailable until you have run
the analysis.
</p>

</dd>

<a name="feature1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Read results from previous run</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Select this option to read in a set of saved results from a previous
run, by using the <span class="GUI">Browse</span> button. If you select this
option, the <span class="GUI">Core definition from</span> options and the <span
class="GUI">Start</span> button are made unavailable, because the analysis has
been done previously. The <span class="GUI">View Results</span> and <span
class="GUI">Save Results</span> buttons are available. 
</p></dd>

<a name="feature2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">File name</span> text box and <span class="GUI">Browse</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>If you are analyzing structures from a file, enter the name of the
structure file in the text box, or click <span class="GUI">Browse</span> and
navigate to the file in the file selector that opens. The file must be in
Maestro or SD format, and can be compressed or uncompressed. The file name is
displayed in the text box when you click <span class="GUI">Open</span>.  Only
available when you choose <span class="GUI">File</span> from the <span
class="GUI">Analyze structures from</span> option menu.</p>
<p>If you are reading results from a previous run, enter the name of the results
zip file into the text box, or click <span class="GUI">Browse</span> and
navigate to the results file in the file selector that opens.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Core definition from</span> options</dt>
<dd><p>Select an option for the definition of the core of the molecule. The
analysis determines the R groups that are attached to this core. See <a
href="#using">Using the R-Group Analysis Panel</a> (above) for information about
the results of using Canvas MCS and SMARTS options for defining the core.
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Canvas maximum common substructure</span>&mdash;Use the
maximum common substructure as determined from a Canvas MCS calculation. If you
choose this option, the <span class="GUI">Atom equivalences</span> option menu
becomes available, and you can choose a definition of equivalent atoms when
determining the core. The options are described in the help message for
<code>canvasMCS</code> and also in the <a
href="../../../canvas/canvas_user_manual.pdf" target="pdfmanuals"><i>Canvas
User Manual</i></a>. 
To ensure that the rings in the core are not broken when finding the
substructure for the core, select <span class="GUI">Do not allow partial rings
in the core</span>.
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">SMARTS</span>&mdash;Specify a SMARTS pattern for the
core in the text area, or select atoms in the Workspace and click 
<span class="GUI">Get SMARTS from Workspace Atom Selection</span>.
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">CombiGlide annotation in structures</span>&mdash;Use
the core definition that has been added by CombiGlide. You should only use this
option if you are using structures that were generated by CombiGlide.
</p></li>
</ul>

groups.  
</p></dd>

<a name="feature6"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Save Results</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Save the results of the analysis in a zip file. Opens a file selector, in
which you can navigate to a location and name the file. The results can
subsequently be read in by using the <span class="GUI">Restore state from
previous run</span> option.
