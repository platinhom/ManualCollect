<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>The <span class="GUI">Bend</span> panel is used to display all the bending
interactions for a given calculation. </p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Force Field Viewer's Bend (Bond Angle) Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Force Field Viewer's Bend (Bond Angle)</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Click <span class="GUI">Bend</span> in the 
<span class="GUI">Force Field Viewer</span> panel.</p></li>
</ul>


<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Force Field Viewer's Bend (Bond Angle) Panel</h2> 


<p>The <a href="#feature1">Bend Interactions List</a>, located on the left
side of the <span class="GUI">Bend</span> panel displays all of the bending
interactions present in the selected <code>.mmo</code> file 
in the order they were read from the file. To select a particular bend,
select it in the list by clicking on it with the left mouse button, or
pick the atoms that define the desired bond angle from the Workspace structure.
The text boxes on the panel will update to display data relevant to the
selected bend. </p>

<dt><span class="GUI">Bend Interactions List</span></dt>
<dd><p>All the bend interactions in a given .mmo file are displayed in the 
<span class="GUI">Bend Interactions List</span> located on the left side of the
<span class="GUI">Bend</span> panel. The list is noneditable.</p></dd>

<a name="feature2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Find by Picking</span></dt>
<dd><p>To locate a particular interaction in the Bend Interaction List,
select <span class="GUI">Find by Picking</span> and click on the three atoms in
the displayed structure that define the bend. Once the third atom has been
picked (and assuming there is a corresponding entry in the list), the
interaction corresponding to those three atoms will be selected in the
list.</p></dd>

<a name="feature3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Sort by Energy</span></dt>
<dd><p>By default, the bend interactions that are displayed in the list
appear in the order they were read from the <code>.mmo</code> file. However, the
list can be sorted according to energy by selecting <span class="GUI">Sort By
Energy</span>. The interaction with the lowest (i.e. most negative) energy will
then be displayed at the beginning of the list and the interaction with the
highest energy (i.e. most positive) will be displayed at the end. </p></dd>

<a name="feature4"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Show</span></dt>
<dd><p>When Maestro first reads a <code>.mmo</code> file, all of the bend
interactions are displayed in the Bend Interactions List. To limit the displayed
bends based on quality, choose <span class="GUI">High Quality</span>, <span
class="GUI">Medium Quality</span>, or <span class="GUI">Low Quality</span> from
the <span class="GUI">Show</span> menu. Limiting the display to only 
the low quality parameters is a useful way to identify those that might
be generalized or that might not be suitable for calculations in which a
high degree of accuracy is desired. Clicking <span class="GUI">All
Parameters</span> option redisplays all bending interactions. </p></dd>

<a name="feature5"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Show Force Field</span></dt>
<dd><p>Clicking <span class="GUI">Show Force Field</span> button opens the
<span class="GUI">FField</span> panel, which displays the <code>.mmo</code> file
in its entirety. When the panel is opened, a text line is selected that
corresponds to the bend that is currently selected in the Bend Interactions
List. </p></dd> 

<a name="feature6"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Bend Energy</span></dt>
<dd><p>Bend energy is the contribution to the total molecular mechanics
energy
arising from the currently selected bend. This can be interpreted as the
energy penalty when the current angle deviates from the ideal value.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature7"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Force Constant</span></dt>
<dd><p>This value is the standard force constant for the currently selected
bend.
More specifically, it is how rapidly the forces holding the current angle
in place change with respect to displacement from that angle. This value
is different for each type of bend interaction. </p></dd>

<a name="feature8"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Ideal Angle</span></dt>
<dd><p>An ideal angle is that which, for the specified geometry, makes the
least
possible energy contribution. </p></dd>

<a name="feature9"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Origin</span></dt>
<dd><p>The <span class="GUI">Origin</span> setting is meant to provide
information regarding 
the actual parameter evaluation method used in the current calculation.
The possible entries in this field include "Original," "Modified
Parameter," and "Additional Parameter." "Original" means that the force
field used was in its native state, as published by the original author.
"Modified" implies that the version used contains parameters that have
been revised based on work by the MacroModel research group or subsequent
publications. Finally, the "Additional Parameter" message indicates that
MacroModel's force field treatment of this particular item involves at least
one parameter that was absent from the native force field. For more
information about which parameters have been modified or added, see the
help topic on a specific field in the list of related topics below. Also,
the source of the modifications/additions is listed on the first line of
each <code>.mmo</code> file. </p></dd>

<a name="feature10"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Alternate</span></dt>
<dd><p>For some force fields, it is possible to modify particular parameters.
For instance, in the AMBER* field, either the Senderowitz-Parish-Still or the
Homans carbohydrate parameters can be chosen. To select an alternate
treatment, you must edit the force field file. The "Alternate:" text field
in the "Force Field Viewer" panels is meant only to notify you which, if
any, modifications were made to the force field before the current
calculation was performed. </p></dd>

<a name="feature11"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Comment</span></dt>
<dd><p>The text in this field is a description of the atom and bond
configurations for the bend interaction that is currently selected in
the Bend Interactions List. </p></dd>

<a name="feature12"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Str-Bend Energy</span></dt>
<dd><p>This is the contribution to the total molecular mechanics energy
arising from stretching associated with the current bend. Note that this value
is only considered for force fields that produce extremely accurate bond
characteristics (MM2* and MMFF). </p></dd>

<a name="feature13"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Str-Bend Force Constant</span></dt>
<dd><p>This text box displays the value associated with the standard
stretch-bend
force constant. The value can be interpreted as the rate that the force
holding two atoms together changes with respect to the distance the atoms
have moved. Note that this value is only considered for force fields that
produce extremely accurate bond characteristics (MM2* and MMFF). </p></dd>

<a name="feature14"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">2nd Str-Bend Force Constant</span></dt>
<dd><p>This text box displays the value associated with the rate that the
force
holding two atoms together changes with respect to the distance the atoms
have moved. Note that this value is only considered for force fields that
produce extremely accurate bond characteristics (MM2* and MMFF). </p></dd>

<a name="feature15"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Actual Angle</span></dt>
<dd><p>The value displayed in this text box describes the sampled
angle that is defined by the atoms whose number set is selected in the
Bend Interactions List. Compare this value with the number displayed in
the <span class="GUI">Ideal Angle</span> text box. </p></dd>

<a name="feature16"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Quality</span></dt>
<dd><p>The designation that appears in this text box refers to the confidence
level for the currently selected measurement. Calculations using the original
force field parameters, or parameters that have otherwise been extensively
researched, are given "High Quality" ratings. Calculations that include
less certain parameters are given "Medium Quality" ratings. Calculations
using parameters that are applied generically, without consideration for
individual bonding situations, are given "Low Quality" designations. Those
parameters that are given "Low Quality" ratings may not be acceptable in
calculations that require high accuracy.</p>

<p>The "Quality" rating system is meant to be used only as a guide. Ratings
are somewhat relative. For instance, a parameter designated as "medium"
quality for a high-accuracy force field like MMFF might still produce
more reliable results than a "high" quality parameter in the MM2* field.
Please note that it is still possible to obtain inaccurate results from a
parameter with a "High Quality" rating. </p></dd>
