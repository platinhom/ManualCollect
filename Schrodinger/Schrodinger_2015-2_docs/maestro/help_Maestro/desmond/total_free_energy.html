<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>In this panel, you can set up and run FEP calculations for molecule
annihilation, which provides a measure of the total free energy of solvation or
complexation. The panel is designed to make setting up FEP jobs as easy as
possible: most of the computational details, such as setting the force field
parameters, solvation, relaxation of the system, and setting the FEP
simulations, are taken care of automatically.
</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Total Free Energy by FEP Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Total Free Energy by FEP</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Applications &rarr; Desmond &rarr; Total Free Energy by FEP</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
</ul>


<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Total Free Energy by FEP Panel</h2> 


<p>Calculating the absolute free energy for a molecule involves running an
&quot;annihiliation&quot; FEP simulation, in which the selected molecule is 
removed from the system. The simulations are automatically prepared,  performed,
and analyzed to yield the absolute free energy for the selected molecule.
</p>
<p><span class="HB">To run an annihilation job:</span></p>

<ol>

<li><p>Include in the Maestro Workspace the system that contains the ligand
molecule to be annnihilated, the receptor protein (optional), and any other key
molecules of the system. (This step can be performed prior to opening the
panel.)</p></li>

<li><p>Select <span class="GUI">Pick the molecule</span>, then pick the
ligand (or molecule) in the Workspace.
</p>
<p>When the ligand is picked, it is colored with green carbons.</p> 
</li>

<li><p>In the <span class="GUI">Plan calculation</span> tab, choose the 
FEP protocol you want to use from the <span class="GUI">FEP protocol</span>
option menu.</p></li>

<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Job Settings</span> from the <span
class="GUI">Settings</span> button menu,</p>
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/settings.png" />
<p>set the job parameters in the <span class="GUI">Job Settings</span> dialog
box, and click <span class="GUI">Run</span> in the dialog box to run
the job.</p></li> 
</ol>

<a name="feature1"></a>
<h3>Define Perturbation tab</h3>

<p>This tab displays a series of steps to follow. Each step has text describing
the task for the step. </p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> involves displaying the ligand, the receptor, and any other
important molecules in the Workspace.
</p>
<p><b>Step 2</b> involves picking the molecule for annihilation. It has a single
option, <span class="GUI">Pick the molecule</span>. When this option is
selected, you can pick an atom on the ligand in the Workspace. When the ligand
is picked, it is colored with green carbons. Once focus is returned to the
panel, this option is deselected.
</p>

<a name="job_toolbar"></a>
<h3>Job toolbar</h3>
<p>The Job toolbar is used to make settings for a job and to start it. </p>

<dl>
<dt><span class="GUI">Job name</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>Enter a name for the job in this text box.
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Settings</span> button menu</dt>
<dd><p>This button opens the <a href="../misc/job_settings.html"><span
class="GUI">Job Settings</span> dialog box</a>. The arrow to the right opens
a menu, from which you can make settings or perform actions that are related to
the job. </p>
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/settings.png" />
<p>The menu items are described below.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="GUI">Job Settings</span>&mdash;Make and save settings for the
incorporation of the job into the Maestro project, the job name, the host,
the distribution of subjobs, and any other application-specific job settings.
Opens the <span class="GUI">Job Settings</span> dialog box.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Preferences</span>&mdash;Set general preferences for
running jobs. Opens the <span class="GUI">Preferences</span> panel at the <a
href="../maestro_menu/preferences.html#jobs_starting"><span class="GUI">Jobs - 
Starting</span> section</a>.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Write</span>&mdash;Write the input files for the job but do not start it. 
The file names are based on the current job name, and the files are written to
a subdirectory of the current working directory that is named with the job
name.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Reset Panel</span>&mdash;Reset the values in the panel to 
their defaults.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Job status</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>This icon indicates when there are jobs running for the application that
belong to the current project. It starts spinning when the first job starts, and
stops when there are no more jobs running. If a job fails to start, it changes
to an exclamation point. 
</p>
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/job_status.png" />
<p>
Clicking the button shows a small job status window that lists the job name and
status for all active jobs submitted from the current panel (for Jaguar and
MacroModel this means all jobs from any of the application panels). You can
double-click on a row to open the <a href="../misc/monitor_panel.html"><span
class="GUI">Monitor</span> panel</a> and monitor the job, or click the <span
class="GUI">Monitor</span> button to open the <span class="GUI">Monitor</span>
panel and close the job status window. The job status is updated while the
window is open. If a job finishes while the window is open, the job remains
displayed but with the new status.  The rows are colored according to the
status: yellow for submitted, green for launched, running, or finished, red for
incorporated, died, or killed.  Click anywhere outside the window to close it.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Run</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Run the job with the current job settings.
</p></dd>
</dl>


<a name="status_bar"></a>
<h3>Status bar</h3>
<p>The status bar displays information about the current job settings for the
panel. This includes the job name, task name and task settings (if any), number
of subjobs (if any) and the host name and job incorporation setting. It also
displays a message for a short time when you start a new job.</p>
<p>The status bar also contains the <span class="GUI">Help</span> button, which
opens the help topic for the panel.</p>
