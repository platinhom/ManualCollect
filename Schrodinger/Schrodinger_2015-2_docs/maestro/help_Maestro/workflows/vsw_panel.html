<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
The <span class="GUI">Virtual Screening Workflow</span> panel enables you to set
up and run jobs to screen ligands against one or more targets. The workflow
includes ligand preparation, filtering, and up to three docking stages with
Glide, progressing from HTVS to SP to XP docking. For docking to multiple
targets (ensemble docking), you can specify docking score offsets for each
target.
</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Virtual Screening Workflow Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Virtual Screening Workflow</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Applications &rarr; Glide &rarr; Virtual Screening Workflow.</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
</ul>


<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Virtual Screening Workflow Panel</h2> 


<p>This panel can be used to run the entire sequence of jobs in the Virtual
Screening Workflow. The panel sets up the input files for LigPrep, QikProp, 
and Glide ligand docking and submits them to the selected host in order. 
</p>

<p>When you run the workflow, you can pregenerate Glide grids for the desired
receptors, or generate grids from the Workspace structure.  For more information
on generating Glide grids, see the <a href="../glide/receptor_grid_generation.html">Glide Receptor
Grid Generation Panel</a> topic.</p>

<p>The ligand files for the workflow can consist of 2D structures or 3D
structures. If you supply 2D structures, you must run the ligand preparation
part of the workflow to convert the structures to 3D for docking. This stage
runs a LigPrep job, with the standard options for most parts of the LigPrep
process. You can control some of these options, but if you want to use other
options, you should run LigPrep on the ligands independently. For more
information, see the <a href="../ligprep/ligprep.html">LigPrep Panel</a> topic,
or the <a href="../../../ligprep/ligprep_user_manual.pdf"
target="pdfmanuals"><i>LigPrep User Manual</i></a>.
Because LigPrep does not sample conformations of 7-membered or larger rings, you
can run a MacroModel job after LigPrep to sample these rings. 
</p> 

<p>Prefiltering of the ligands can also be performed as part of the workflow. If
you want to use the Lipinski Rule option, you must run QikProp to obtain the
required properties. You can run QikProp as part of the workflow, regardless of
the ligand source. If you have already run QikProp, you do not need to run it
again. The reactive groups filter is a predefined filter that removes ligands
with these groups. If you want to specify a custom filter, you can provide an
input file for  <code>ligfilter</code>, which will then filter the structures,
or set up the filter in a graphical interface.  You can also choose whether to
filter the ligands before or after preparation. For more information 
on <code>ligfilter</code>, see 
<a href="../../maestro_user_manual.pdf"
target="pdfmanuals">Appendix D of the <i>Maestro User Manual</i></a>
</p>

<p>The full workflow includes three docking stages. The first stage performs
HTVS docking.  The ligands that are retained are then passed to the next stage,
which performs SP docking; the survivors of this stage are passed on to the
third stage, which performs XP docking. At each stage you can decide how many
ligands are kept, and whether the ionization and tautomeric states of each
ligand are kept.</p>

<p>The stages of the job are managed by a master job, and the work can be
divided into subjobs, which can in turn be distributed over multiple processors.
The master job runs locally, but you can specify hosts to run the ligand
preparation (LigPrep) and grid generation and docking (Glide) and the number of
processors to use on each host, in the <span class="GUI">Job Settings</span> dialog
box. For docking you can specify the number of subjobs, in the <span
class="GUI">Separate into N subjobs</span> text box, or select <span
class="GUI">Adjust</span> to automatically adjust the number of subjobs so that
each takes between 1 and 10 hours.  For effective load balancing of a
distributed job, the number of subjobs should be several times the number of
processors.</p>

<p>The workflow is intended to be robust, so that if a subjob fails, the master
job attempts to rerun the job a few times before quitting. </p>

<p>If you want to incorporate the results in to the Maestro project, you can
choose <span class="GUI">Append new entries</span> from the option menu in the
<span class="GUI">Output</span> section of the <span class="GUI">Job Settings</span>
dialog box.
</p>

<p>You can dock the ligands to multiple receptors in the workflow, and provide
an offset for the GlideScore so that the results from different receptors can be
compared. If you want to merge more results later, you can do this with the
script <code>$SCHRODINGER/utilities/glide_ensemble_merge</code>. Use the
<code>-h</code> option for the syntax of this script.</p>

<h2>Virtual Screening Workflow Panel Features</h2> 


<p>The main part of the <span class="GUI">Virtual Screening Workflow</span>
panel consists of five tabs for setting up screening jobs. These tabs are
described in separate topics.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="vsw_input_tab.html"><span class="GUI">Input</span> 
tab</a></li>
<li><a href="vsw_filtering_tab.html"><span class="GUI">Filtering</span>

<li><a href="vsw_docking_tab.html"><span class="GUI">Docking</span> 
tab</a></li>
</ul>

<a name="job_toolbar"></a>
<p>The Job toolbar is used to make settings for a job and to start it. </p>

<dl>
<dt><span class="GUI">Job name</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>Enter a name for the job in this text box.
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Settings</span> button menu</dt>
<dd><p>This button opens the <a href="../misc/job_settings.html"><span
class="GUI">Job Settings</span> dialog box</a>. The arrow to the right opens
a menu, from which you can make settings or perform actions that are related to
the job. </p>
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/settings.png" />
<p>The menu items are described below.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="GUI">Job Settings</span>&mdash;Make and save settings for the
incorporation of the job into the Maestro project, the job name, the host,
the distribution of subjobs, and any other application-specific job settings.
Opens the <span class="GUI">Job Settings</span> dialog box.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Preferences</span>&mdash;Set general preferences for
running jobs. Opens the <span class="GUI">Preferences</span> panel at the <a
href="../maestro_menu/preferences.html#jobs_starting"><span class="GUI">Jobs - 
Starting</span> section</a>.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Write</span>&mdash;Write the input files for the job but do not start it. 
The file names are based on the current job name, and the files are written to
a subdirectory of the current working directory that is named with the job
name.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Reset Panel</span>&mdash;Reset the values in the panel to 
their defaults.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Job status</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>This icon indicates when there are jobs running for the application that
belong to the current project. It starts spinning when the first job starts, and
stops when there are no more jobs running. If a job fails to start, it changes
to an exclamation point. 
</p>
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/job_status.png" />
<p>
Clicking the button shows a small job status window that lists the job name and
status for all active jobs submitted from the current panel (for Jaguar and
MacroModel this means all jobs from any of the application panels). You can
double-click on a row to open the <a href="../misc/monitor_panel.html"><span
class="GUI">Monitor</span> panel</a> and monitor the job, or click the <span
class="GUI">Monitor</span> button to open the <span class="GUI">Monitor</span>
panel and close the job status window. The job status is updated while the
window is open. If a job finishes while the window is open, the job remains
displayed but with the new status.  The rows are colored according to the
status: yellow for submitted, green for launched, running, or finished, red for
incorporated, died, or killed.  Click anywhere outside the window to close it.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Run</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Run the job with the current job settings.
</p></dd>
</dl>


<a name="status_bar"></a>
<dt>Status bar</dt>
<dd><p>The status bar displays information about the current job settings for the
panel. This includes the job name, task name and task settings (if any), number
of subjobs (if any) and the host name and job incorporation setting. It also
displays a message for a short time when you start a new job.</p>
<p>The status bar also contains the <span class="GUI">Help</span> button, which
opens the help topic for the panel.</p>
