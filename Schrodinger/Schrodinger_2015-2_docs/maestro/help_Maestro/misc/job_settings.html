<h2>Job Settings Dialog Box Features</h2> 


<p>The features present in the <span class="GUI">Job Settings</span> dialog box
depend on the calculation to be carried out. Each instance of this dialog box
has a <span class="GUI">Job</span> section and a set of action buttons.
If the job produces structural output and properties, the dialog box can also
have an <span class="GUI">Output</span> section. Other, job-specific controls
are made available as needed. The controls that are common to many instances of
the <span class="GUI">Job Settings</span> dialog box are described below.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#feature1"><span class="GUI">Output</span> section</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature2"><span class="GUI">Job</span> section</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature3">Action buttons</a></li>
</ul>

<a name="feature1"></a>
<h3>Output section</h3>

<p>The <span class="GUI">Output</span> section, if present, contains
an <span class="GUI">Incorporate</span> option menu for choosing the manner
in which the structural and property results of the calculation are incorporated into
the project. The menu has the following options:</p>
<dl>
<dt><span class="GUI">Append new entries as a new group</span></dt>
<dd><p> Each structure in the output file is added to the project as a new entry,
and the entries are grouped. The group name is set to the name of the file from
which the entries were read, minus the extension.
This is the default option.</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Append new entries in place</span></dt>
<dd><p>Each new entry is added to the project immediately below its source
entry, i.e. the entry that was used as input for the job. If there is no source
entry, the new entry is added to the end of the entry list in the project as an
individual entry.
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Append new entries individually</span></dt>
<dd><p> Each structure in the output file is added to the project as a new entry,
but the entries are not grouped. </p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Replace existing entries</span></dt>
<dd><p>Any entries that served as input for the job are replaced with the new
structures returned from the calculation.</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Do not incorporate</span></dt>
<dd><p>No change is made to the project when the job is complete.</p></dd>
</dl>

<a name="feature2"></a>
<h3>Job section</h3>

<p>Some of these controls may be absent for a given instance of the dialog box.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#feature2.0"><span class="GUI">Name</span> text box</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature2.2"><span class="GUI">Host</span> option menu</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature2.3"><span class="GUI">CPUs</span> or <span class="GUI">Total processors</span> text box</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature2.3.5"><span class="GUI">Distribute subjobs across</span>
options and text boxes</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature2.4"><span class="GUI">Separate job into <i>N</i> subjobs</span> text box</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature2.5"><span class="GUI">Scratch directory</span> option menu</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature2.6"><span class="GUI">Host list</span> table</a></li>
<li><a href="#gpgpu"><span class="GUI">Automatically select GPUs</span> option
and GPU table</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature2.0.0"><span class="GUI">Entry Title</span> text box</a></li>
</ul>

<dl>
<a name="feature2.0.0"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Title</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>Specify the title to be used in the input structure file. The default is
the entry title. 
</p></dd>

<a name="feature2.0"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Name</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>Enter a name for the job. When a job is started, a subdirectory of the
working directory is created using the job name (depending on the application),
for writing job files in. Job files are named with the job name as the first
part (stem or prefix) of the file names.</p> 
<p>The initial name shown is a standard name for the application, which might
include calculation settings. A standard name that contains settings is updated
when the settings change. You can modify a standard name; if you do and it still
retains some settings, the name is updated if the settings change. You can also 
replace the entire job name.</p>
<p>
When a standard name or modified standard name is used, the job name is made
unique by appending an integer. This is done by checking for job directories or
files in the current working directory. However, if you replace the job name to
create a custom job name, the name might no longer be unique, and it is not
automatically made unique. In that case, a warning is posted before any files
are overwritten.
</p>
<p>After a job is submitted, a new job name is automatically created for the
next job from the current job name, by appending an integer or incrementing the
integer. This is done for custom job names as well as standard or modified names.
</p>
</dd>

<a name="feature2.2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Host</span> option menu</dt>
<dd><p>The <span class="GUI">Host</span> menu displays all the hosts defined in the
<tt>$SCHRODINGER/schrodinger.hosts</tt> file, with the number of CPUs available
on the host in parentheses. To run the selected job on a remote host, choose
the host from this menu. </p></dd>

<a name="feature2.3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">CPUs</span> or <span class="GUI">Total processors</span>
text box</dt>
<dd><p>Specify the number of processors to use to run the job. Absent if the job
cannot be distributed or run in parallel. The number of processors actually 
used is limited by the number of licenses available for the type of job. 
</p></dd>

<a name="feature2.3.5"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Distribute subjobs across</span> options and text boxes</dt>
<dd><p>Choose an option for how to distribute the subjobs for parallel
execution. These options apply to Jaguar jobs, which can use both MPI processes
and OMP threads for parallelization.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="GUI">CPUs</span>&mdash;Specify only the number of processors to
use. The number of MPI processes and threads are determined automatically for
some job types, while for others, the subjobs are distributed between the
processors, one per processor.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">MPI processes</span>&mdash;Specify the
number of MPI processes and the number of threads per process to use, and the
number of subjobs to run simultaneously. The total number of processors
requested is the product of these three numbers, as each subjob runs with the
specified number of MPI processes and threads. When this option is selected,
text boxes for the numbers are displayed, and the total number of CPUs that
result from the values in the text boxes is reported to the right.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<a name="feature2.4"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Separate job into <i>N</i> subjobs</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>For jobs that can be distributed over multiple CPUs (and multiple hosts),
specify the number of subjobs to split the job into. This number can be larger
than the number of CPUs used, and it is often a good idea to choose a number
that is several times the number of CPUs for optimal load balancing. </p></dd>

<a name="feature2.5"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Scratch directory</span> option menu</dt>
<dd><p>Select the scratch directory (used for temporary storage during the
running of the job). The available scratch directories are taken from the
<tt>tmpdir</tt> settings in the <tt>$SCHRODINGER/schrodinger.hosts</tt> file.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature2.6"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Host list</span> table</dt>
<dd><p>The <span class="GUI">Host list</span> table is available for
applications that can distribute jobs over multiple hosts. The table displays
all the hosts defined in the <tt>$SCHRODINGER/schrodinger.hosts</tt> file, with
the number of processors available on the host in the <span
class="GUI">Processors</span> column. The <span class="GUI">Use</span> column
specifies the number of processors to use from the given host. The default 
number is the number available, or * if it is a queue host. You can edit this
column to set the number of processors, and you can reset the values to the
default by clicking <span class="GUI">Reset All</span>.</p>

<p>To specify the hosts and number of processors to use for a job, edit the
values in the <span class="GUI">Use</span> column as needed, and select the
desired hosts in the table. The total number of processors for the job is
reported in the <span class="GUI">Total to use</span> text box.  </p>

<p>When you select hosts for the job, you can only select one queue host, and
you cannot select both queue and non-queue hosts. If you select a queue host,
all other table rows are deselected.
</p>

</dd>

<a name="gpgpu"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Automatically select GPUs</span> option and GPU table</dt>
<dd><p>This option and table is present only for applications that can run on a
graphics processor (GPU). The option is made available when you choose a
GPU-enabled host from the <span class="GUI">Host</span> option menu. The 
<span class="GUI">Total processors</span> text box changes to <span
class="GUI">Total GPUs</span>. If you select <span class="GUI">Automatically
select GPUs</span>, then you can enter the total number of GPUs to use in
the <span class="GUI">Total GPUs</span> text box. If you deselect this option,
you can select GPUs in the table by clicking on the row for each of the
GPUs. Clicking again deselects the GPU. The number of GPUs you select is
reported in the <span class="GUI">Total GPUs</span> text box, which is
noneditable in this situation.
</p></dd>

</dl>

<a name="feature3"></a>
<h3>Action buttons</h3>

<p>There are three actions you can take after making settings, by clicking one
of these buttons:
</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="GUI">Run</span>&mdash;Save the settings for this job type, and
start the current job.
</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Cancel</span>&mdash;Discard the changes made to the
settings.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">OK</span>&mdash;Save the settings for this job type, but
do not start the job. </li>
</ul>
