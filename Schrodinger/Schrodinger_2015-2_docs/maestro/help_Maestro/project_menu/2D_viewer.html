<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>The 2D viewer allows you to display 2D structures for entries in the Project
Table, in a rectangular grid, and use them to select and include structures. 
</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the 2D Viewer Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">2D Viewer</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Project &rarr; 2D Viewer</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Table &rarr; 2D Viewer</span> 
in the <span class="GUI">Project Table</span> panel.
</p></li>
<li><p>Click the <span class="GUI">2D Viewer</span> button 
on the <span class="GUI">Project</span> toolbar in the <span class="GUI">Project Table</span> panel.
</p></li>
<li><p>Click the <span class="GUI">2D Viewer</span> button 
on the <span class="GUI">Project</span> toolbar in the main window.
</p></li>

<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the 2D Viewer Panel</h2> 


<p>The basic function of the <span class="GUI">2D Viewer</span> panel is to
display 2D representations of the structures in the Project Table and provide
capabilities for selecting and including the entries from this panel.
</p>

<p>The 2D structures are images that are created when the panel is opened, or
when you click <span class="GUI">Update</span> to update the panel contents
from the Project Table. Images are not created for proteins or other large
structures, but if a protein has a ligand, the ligand structure is drawn, and an
icon is displayed in the top right corner to indicate that the structure
contains a protein. The images can be exported in various formats.
</p>

<p>In addition to the structures, properties can be displayed below the
structures in each cell. Real properties are displayed to the same precision
as in the Project Table. You can also display an atom-level property, such as
the atom name, instead of the atomic symbol. To select properties to display,
choose <span class="GUI">Edit &rarr; Select Properties</span>. 
</p>

<p>Each cell in the display area corresponds to an entry in the Project
Table. You can select cells with the usual shift-click and control-click
actions, and you can drag to select cells.With a single cell selected, you can
step through the structures with the arrow buttons or with the N and P keys on
the keyboard. </p> 

<p>The selection is independent of the selection in the Project Table by
default, but you can make the panel selection and the Project Table selection
the same by selecting <span class="GUI">Synchronize selection with Project
Table</span>. </p>

<p>The inclusion state is always the same as in the Project Table, and is
indicated by the square in the top left of each cell. You can automatically
include in the Workspace the structures that you select in the panel by
selecting <span class="GUI">Include selection in Workspace</span>. With this
option, whenever you select a table cell, the structure is included in the
Workspace.

<a name="feature0"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Edit</span> menu</dt>
<dd><p>This menu allows you to edit the display settings and the list of
properties that is shown for each entry.
</p>

<ul>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Copy</span>&mdash;Copy the image for the selected cell
to the clipboard, where it can be pasted into another application. You can also
use <span class="Keys">Ctrl+C</span> (<span class="Keys">&#x2318;C</span>) to
copy the image. Only one cell must be selected. 
</p></li>


<li><p><span class="GUI">Select Properties</span>&mdash;Choose the structure
properties to display in each table cell in the display area. Opens the <a
href="2D_viewer_properties_db.html"><span class="GUI">2D Viewer - Select
Properties</span> dialog box</a>, in which you can select the properties to
display.
</p></li>

<li><p><span class="GUI">Settings</span>&mdash;Set options for the export of
structures. Opens the <a href="2D_viewer_settings.html"><span class="GUI">2D
Viewer - Settings</span> dialog box</a> to make the settings.
</p></li>

<li><p><span class="GUI">2D Display Settings</span>&mdash;Set options for the
display of the 2D structures. Opens the <span class="GUI">Preferences</span>
panel at the <a href="../maestro_menu/preferences.html#2d_structure"><span
class="GUI">2D structure</span> group</a>.
</p></li>
</ul>

</dd>

<a name="feature1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Export</span> menu</dt>
<dd><p>This menu allows you to export selected 2D structures in a variety of
formats.
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Export to PDF</span>&mdash;Export the structures as
images in a PDF file, in an array with the same
number of columns as in the panel. Opens a dialog box in which
you can navigate to a location and name the file. The properties displayed with
the structure are included in the images. Images are exported as scalable vector
graphics.
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Export to PNG</span>&mdash;Export the selected
structures to separate PNG files. Opens a dialog box
in which you can navigate to a location and provide a base name for the files.
The files are named <i>base</i><code>-</code><i>NNN</i><code>.png</code>, where
<i>NNN</i> is a serial number for the image, starting from 001. Only the 2D
structure is included in the image. 
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Export to HTML</span>&mdash;Export the selected
structures as PNG images included in a table in an HTML page, with the same
number of columns as in the panel. Opens a dialog box
in which you can navigate to a location and name the file. The images are
exported into a directory in the same location. If the file is named
<i>myimages</i><code>.html</code>, the image directory is named
<i>myimages</i><code>_img</code> and the image files are named
<i>myimagesN</i><code>.png</code>, where <i>N</i> is an index starting from 1.
The links to the images are relative, so the file and image directory can be
moved to another location easily. The structure title is included as alt text
for the image. The properties displayed with the structure are included below
the image in the HTML file.
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Export to 3D SD with SMILES</span>&mdash;Export the
selected structures to an SD file as 3D structures (not 2D structures), with
the unique SMILES string added as a property. 
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Export to 2D SD</span>&mdash;Export the selected
structures as 2D structures to an SD file. 
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Export to EPS</span>&mdash;Export the selected
structures to separate encapsulated PostScript files. Opens a dialog box
in which you can navigate to a location and provide a base name for the files.
The files are named <i>base</i><code>-</code><i>NNN</i><code>.eps</code>, where
<i>NNN</i> is a serial number for the image, starting from 001. Only the 2D
structure is included in the image. 
</p></li>
</ul>
