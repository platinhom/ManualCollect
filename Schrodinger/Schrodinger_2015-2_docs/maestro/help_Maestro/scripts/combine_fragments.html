<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>In this panel you can set up and run jobs that attach a set of pre-positioned
fragments, either to each other or to a defined core-containing molecule. 
</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Combine Fragments Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Combine Fragments</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Scripts &rarr; Fragments &rarr; Combine Fragments</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
</ul>


<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Combine Fragments Panel</h2> 


<p>The <span class="GUI">Combine Fragments</span> panel allows you to run a job
to join fragments that are pre-positioned with respect to each other, for
example by docking into a receptor site. The fragments can either be joined
directly to each other (&quot;direct joining&quot;) or they can be joined to 
defined core-containing molecules (&quot;core linking&quot;). 
</p>

<p>The fragments are joined by identifying bonds that can be formed between the
fragments, or the fragment and the core-containing molecule. The bonds are
identified by two criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>The angle between the bond directions must be less than a threshold. The
default is 15&deg; This criterion ensures a proper rotational alignment of the
fragments .</li>
<li>The distance between the atom that remains in one fragment and the atom that
leaves in the other fragment must be less than a threshold (after adjustment of
the bond lengths in each fragment to the ideal bond length for the new
bond). The default is 1&nbsp;&Aring;. This criterion ensures a proper
translational alignment of the fragments.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The fragments can overlap, and both internal and peripheral (H and halogen)
bonds can considered for breaking to form a bond with another fragment. However,
if the distance between the fragment centroids is below a given (settable)
threshold, the fragments are not joined: they are considered to occupy the same
location in the receptor.
</p>

<p>The thresholds can be set in the 
<a href="combine_fragments_options_db.html"><span class="GUI">Combine Fragments
- Advanced Options</span> dialog box</a>.
</p>

<p>Direct linking of fragments is done in several rounds. The first round
attempts to join pairs of fragments. In the second round, the results of the
first round are used as input, so that the results can be combinations of up to
four fragments, and so on. </p>
<p>For fragments that have no atoms that are close
enough to create new bonds but are still not far apart, methylene linkers are
included to assess whether a bond can be formed. One methlyene is added to each
fragment; thus two fragments can be joined by at most two methylene linkers.
</p>

<p>In core linking, the fragments are joined in turn to each core molecule, but
are not joined to each other, and no methylene linkers are included. A minimum
and a maximum number of fragments to attach to each core can be set; the
defaults are 2 and 4. The bonds considered for linking in the core molecule are
all terminal bonds (carbon-hydrogen and carbon-halogen). Since there is
potentially a large number of combinations, the fragments are randomly sampled
in a number of trials, with no repetitions between trials. The number of trials
can be set; the default is 20. 
</p>

<p>Once the fragments are combined, the resultant structures are passed through
a minimization in which all heavy atoms in the fragments are restrained with a
restraint of 100&nbsp;kcal/mol. No restraints are placed on core molecules or
linker atoms.

<a name="feature1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Use ligands from</span> input controls</dt>
<dd><p>Specify the source of the ligands (fragments) by choosing an item from
the option menu. The choices are <span class="GUI">Project Table (selected
entries)</span> and <span class="GUI">File</span>. If you select <span
class="GUI">File</span>, the <span class="GUI">Input file</span> text box and
<span class="GUI">Browse</span> button become available, and you can enter the
file name in the text box or click <span class="GUI">Browse</span> and navigate
to the file. The file must be in Maestro format. 
</p></dd>

<a name="feature2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Direct joining</span> option and controls</dt>
<dd><p>Select this option to join the fragments directly to each other (with the
possible addition of 1 or 2 methylene linkers). When the option is selected, you
can specify the number of rounds that are run when trying to join the
fragments. Fragments are joined in pairs in each round, and the output of each
round is the input for the next round, so that you can join multiple fragments.
</p>
<p>You can also select <span class="GUI">Check for VDW clashes before
joining</span> to check whether there is any overlap between the fragment atoms
based on their van der Waals radii before joining the fragments. If this option
is selected, fragment combinations that have clashes are skipped.</p></dd>

<a name="feature3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Linking</span> option and controls</dt>
<dd><p>Select this option to join the fragments to one or more core-containing
molecule. These molecules are specified by entering a file name in the <span
class="GUI">Core file</span> text box, or clicking <span
class="GUI">Browse</span> and navigating to the file. All molecules in the file
are used as cores. 
</p></dd>

<a name="feature4"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Attachment bonds</span> section</dt>
<dd><p>In this section you specify the attachment bonds on the fragments:
the bonds that are broken and then joined to another fragment or to a core.

</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<a name="feature8"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Minimize</span> section</dt>
<dd><p>Select the <span class="GUI">Minimize</span> option to perform a partial
or complete minimization of the joined structure. The section contains two
options, one to minimize only the joined atoms and all the terminal (hydrogen
and halogen) atoms, and the other to minimize all atoms. 
</p>
<p>If minimization is performed and <span class="GUI">Check for VDW clashes
before joining</span> is not selected, LigPrep is run with the option to
untangle the structures, and discard any that can't be untangled. This process
can increase the time taken by an order of magnitude, so a warning dialog box
opens when you start the job with these conditions, giving you the opportunity
to change the options.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature5"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Maximum output structures</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>Specify the maximum number of output structures from the possible
combinations of fragments or of fragments and cores. The default is 10.
