<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>In the <span class="GUI">Excluded Volumes</span> dialog box, you can pick
atoms to define a volume that should not contain atoms in any active ligand that
matches the hypothesis, or generate them using some automated procedures.</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Excluded Volumes Dialog Box</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Excluded Volumes</span> dialog box, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Click <span class="GUI">Excluded Volumes</span> in the 
<span class="GUI">Score Hypotheses</span> step of the <span class="GUI">Develop Common Pharmacophore Hypotheses</span> panel.</p></li>
<li><p>Click <span class="GUI">Excluded Volumes</span> in the 
<span class="GUI">Build QSAR Model</span> step of the <span class="GUI">Develop Common Pharmacophore Hypotheses</span> panel.</p></li>
<li><p>Click <span class="GUI">Excluded Volumes</span> in the 
<span class="GUI">Manage Pharmacophore Hypotheses</span> panel.</p></li>
</ul>


<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Excluded Volumes Dialog Box</h2> 


<p>The <span class="GUI">Excluded Volumes</span> dialog box provides means to
add excluded volumes manually to a hypothesis, or to run a program that places
excluded volumes automatically at locations defined by the program input.
</p>

<p>Manual placement of excluded volumes creates volumes at the location of atoms
or at the centroid of a set of picked atoms. First select <span class="GUI">Pick
atoms to create excluded volume</span>, then pick atoms in the Workspace. Each
pick adds an excluded volume with the radius specified in the <span
class="GUI">Radius</span> text box (default 1&nbsp;&Aring;). </p>
<p>To place an excluded volume at the centroid of a set of atoms, shift-click to
pick the second and subsequent atoms. After each pick, the centroid of the atom
set is calculated and the excluded volume sphere is moved to the centroid. To
remove an atom from the set, use control-click. (This is the normal selection
behavior for atoms.)</p>

<p>The sphere radius and the coordinates of the bolume are added to the table
when it is created and the sphere is colored yellow.  You can
edit the table cells to change the radius and the centroid location.</p>

<p>There are three automated procedures for placement of excluded volumes.
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You can place excluded volumes on selected atoms of a receptor
structure, to which the reference ligand of the hypothesis must be properly
aligned. Include the receptor in the Workspace, then click <span
class="GUI">Receptor</span>, to open the <a
href="excluded_volumes_receptor.html"><span class="GUI">Excluded Volumes from
Receptor</span> dialog box</a>. 
</p></li>
<li><p>You can place excluded volumes in a full or a partial shell around a set
of structures that is aligned to the hypothesis. Include the structures in the
Workspace, then click <span class="GUI">Reference Structures</span>, to open the 
<a href="excluded_volumes_reference_structures.html"><span class="GUI">Excluded
Volumes from Reference Structures</span> dialog box</a>.
</p></li> 
<li><p>You can place excluded volumes on atoms in a set of inactive ligands that
do not occupy the same region of space as atoms in any of a set of active
ligands. Click <span class="GUI">Inactives and Actives</span> to open the 
<a href="excluded_volumes_inactives_actives.html"><span class="GUI">Excluded
Volumes from Inactives and Actives</span> dialog box</a>.
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Excluded volumes from all of these methods are added to the volumes table.
You can select multiple volumes either in the table or in the Workspace, with
shift-click and control-click. The spheres for the selected rows are highlighted
in the Workspace.</p>

<p>You can move the excluded volume spheres in the Workspace:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Select <span class="GUI">Pick excluded volume to translate.</span>
</p></li>
<li><p>Select the excluded volumes in the table or in the Workspace.</p>
<p>The volumes are colored red. Use shift-click and control-click to select
multiple volumes. 
</p></li>
<li><p>Drag in the Workspace with the right mouse button. 
</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Dragging excluded volumes only moves them in the viewing plane. To switch to
another plane you can rotate the view, for example with the <span
class="GUI">Rotate X</span> and <span class="GUI">Rotate Y</span> buttons on the
<a href="../tool_bar/main_view_toolbar.html"><span class="GUI">View</span>
toolbar</a> in the main window.
</p>

<td><img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/rotate90y.png"/></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>To delete volumes, select them in the table and click <span
class="GUI">Delete</span>. You might want to delete volumes from the automated
procedures that overlap with each other, for example. Deleting redundant volumes
reduces the time required to apply these volumes when screening structures for
matches to the hypothesis.</p>

<dt><span class="GUI">Pick atoms to create excluded volume</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Select this option to start picking atoms in the Workspace to define an
excluded volume. To create an excluded volume on an atom, click on the
atom. To create an excluded volume at the centroid of a set of atoms, click on
the first atom, and shift-click on the subsequent atoms. A sphere with the
default radius is placed at the centroid and is moved to the new centroid at
each pick. The atoms in the current set are marked with small spheres. If you
want to remove an atom from the set, control-click the atom. 
</p></dd>

<a name="radius"></a>

in the table. 
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Pick excluded volumes to translate</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Select this option to pick and drag excluded volumes to a new location in
the Workspace. You can only move them in the current viewing plane, so to move
them in other planes you must rotate the hypothesis. You can move multiple
excluded volumes by selecting them with shift-click, then dragging.

</p></li>

<li><p><span class="GUI">Reference Structures</span>&mdash;
Create excluded volumes by placing spheres around part or all of one or
more reference structures. 
Opens the <a href="excluded_volumes_reference_structures.html"><span

</p></li>

<li><p><span class="GUI">Inactives and Actives</span>&mdash;
