<p>Field-based QSAR methods originated with the CoMFA and CoMSIA methods,
described in <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc.</i> <b>1988</b>, <i>110</i>, 5959 and
<i>J. Med. Chem.</i> <b>1994</b>, <i>37</i>, 4130. 
</p>

<p>CoMFA field-based models are constructed by calculating the value of fields,
such as the electrostatic field, on a rectangular grid that encompasses the
molecules in the training set. Grid points that are closer than 2 &Aring; to any
atom in the training set are excluded. The grid locations are the independent
variables that are used in a partial-least-squares (PLS) fitting procedure to
produce a relationship between the values of the fields and the activity of the
training set molecules. 
</p>

<p>CoMSIA fields are also evaluated at points on a rectangular grid. The fields
are calculated by summing the values of properties of a given atom, weighted by
a Gaussian function of the distance between the grid point and the atom. The
steric contribution is derived from the third power of the atomic radius, the
electrostatic field from the partial atomic charges, and the hydrophobic field
from estimated ALOGP values. Hydrogen-bond receptor and donor fields have a
value of 1 at the donor location.
</p>

<p>The Schr&ouml;dinger field-based QSAR method is an implementation of the
CoMFA/CoMSIA methods with a specific set of parameters. The Lennard-Jones steric
potentials are taken from the OPLS_2005 force field, as are the atomic charges
for the electrostatic fields. Hydrophobic fields are based on the atom types and
hydrophobic parameters in Ghose, Viswanadhan, Wendoloski, J. Phys. Chem A
<b>1998</b>, <i>102</i>, 3762&ndash;3772. Hydrogen bond acceptor and donor
and aromatic ring fields are based on Phase pharmacophore feature definitions,
with projected points.
</p>
<p>As the models are not exactly the same as the standard CoMFA and CoMSIA
models, different names have been used here: Force Field for CoMFA-like
models, and Gaussian for CoMSIA-like models.
</p>

<p>Before performing the PLS regression, scaling is applied to each field, by
evaluating the standard deviation in the fields at each point, then averaging
the SD over all points. Each field is scaled by the ratio of the maximum of
these averages over all fields to the average for the field.
