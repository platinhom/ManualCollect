<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>In this panel you can set up a Phase 3D QSAR model from a set of aligned
ligands, and use the model to predict activities for other molecules. You can
also visualize the QSAR model in the Workspace, add the QSAR model to a
hypothesis, and create a scatter plot of the activities.
</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Atom-Based QSAR Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Atom-Based QSAR</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Applications &rarr; Phase &rarr; Atom-Based QSAR</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
</ul>

</ul>

<a name="feature1"></a>
<h3>View QSAR Model button</h3>
<p>Click this button to view the QSAR model in the Workspace. This button is the
same as in the <a href="build_qsar_model.html">Build QSAR Model Step</a>.
</p>

<a name="feature2"></a>
<h3>Add ligands buttons</h3>
<p>These buttons allow you to add ligands to the ligands table.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="GUI">From Project</span>&mdash;Opens the 
<a href="add_from_project_db.html"><span class="GUI">Add From Project</span>
dialog box</a>, in which you can choose a set of entries and select an activity
property, converting it into the appropriate units if need be. 
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">From File</span>&mdash;Opens a file selector, in which
you can navigate to and select the file. When you click <span
class="GUI">OK</span>, the <a href="choose_activity_property_db.html"><span
class="GUI">Choose Activity Property</span> dialog box</a> opens, in which you
can select an activity property, converting it into the appropriate units if
need be, and select a QSAR set property, to define the members of the training
set and the test set by a value of this property.
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The ligands you add must be fully prepared 3D structures that are properly
aligned. No facility is provided in this panel for preparing the structures or
aligning the ligands.
</p>

<a name="feature3b"></a>
<h3>Delete and Delete All buttons</h3>
<p>These buttons allow you to delete ligands from the ligands table. 
The <span class="GUI">Delete</span> button deletes the selected ligands from the
table. This allows you to change a model by removing ligands, or replacing
ligands, for example. The <span class="GUI">Delete All</span> button removes all
ligands from the table. This is useful if you want to create a model with a
different set of ligands. 
</p>

<a name="feature3"></a>
<h3>Ligands table</h3>

<p>This table contains the list of ligands. When the ligands are first read, 
all ligands are included in the training set, and the <span class="GUI">#
Factors</span> and <span class="GUI">Predicted Activity</span> columns are
empty. These columns are added after the QSAR model is built. The table columns
are described below.
</p>

<p>Most of the columns of this table are noneditable. You can change the
activity values, select the training and test sets, and display the ligands in
the Workspace.  You can sort the table by the values in a column, by clicking
the column heading. Use shift-click and control-click to select multiple rows.
</p>

<table cellpadding=5>
<tr>
<td><span class="GUI">In</span></td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>Inclusion status of the ligand. The diamond has a cross in it if the ligand
is included in the Workspace, and is empty if the ligand is excluded. You can include
and exclude ligands with click, shift-click and control-click.

column repeatedly to cycle the ligand through the three possible
states. Control-click to cycle the selected ligands through the three
states. The state for the selected ligands is set to the state for the row that
is clicked. </td>

Each row contains the prediction from a model containing the number of PLS
factors indicated in the <span class="GUI"># Factors</span> column. </td>
</tr>

<h3>Random Training Set Controls</h3>
<p>These controls allow you to randomly select the training set. </p>

<dl>
<a name="feature4.1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Random training set</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>Specify the percentage of ligands to include in the training set by
random selection from the ligands in the union of the training set and the test set.

<dd><p>Click to apply a random selection of the training set from the ligands
that are in the union of the training set and the test set. The ligands that are

<a name="feature4.3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Random seed</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>Enter the seed for the random selection of the training set in this text
box. A zero value means that a different seed will be selected each time, and
hence a different training set. A nonzero value means that the same seed is used
each time, which produces the same training set.  
</p></dd>
</dl>

<a name="feature5"></a>

<h3>Atom type fractions table</h3>
<p>Display the fraction due to each atom type in the QSAR model for each number
of PLS factors used in the model. Only those atom types that are present in the
training set are represented in the table. This information can give you a
general idea of how much each atom type affects the activity.
</p>


<a name="feature7"></a>
<h3>Action buttons</h3>
<p>The following buttons can be used to perform actions once a QSAR model is
available.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><span class="GUI">Export</span></dt>
<dd><p>Export the QSAR model to files. The model data is written to the named
file, for example <code>mymodel.qsar</code>. The ligands are written to a
Maestro file, which for the example given would be
<code>mymodel_qsar_pred.mae</code>. The activity properties and the QSAR set
membership are written to the ligand file.
