<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Build a single organometallic complex with a single metal center, in
octahedral, tetrahedral, or square planar geometry.  
</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Build Single Complex Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Build Single Complex</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Applications &rarr; Materials Science &rarr; Build Organometallic Complexes &rarr; Build Single Complex</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Tasks &rarr; Materials &rarr; Build Organometallic Complexes &rarr; Build Single Complex</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
</ul>


<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Build Single Complex Panel</h2> 


<p>There are three main steps to building an organometallic complex:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Choose the metal and the coordination geometry. </p>
<p>You can do this in the <span class="GUI">Complex information</span>
section. Type in the atomic symbol for the metal, and choose the geometry from
the <span class="GUI">Geometry</span> option menu. 
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose the ligands. </p>
<p>In this step, you decide how many different ligands you want to use, how many
of each ligand to use, and select or sketch the ligands. Each ligand is
represented by a row in the <span class="GUI">Ligands</span> section.  Each row
specifies the number of copies of the ligand, and has a button to assign a
ligand structure to this row. For example, for an ML<sub>3</sub>X<sub>3</sub>
complex, you would have two rows, one for ligand L and one for ligand X, and for 
each you would set the number of copies to 3. Rows can be added by clicking <span
class="GUI">Add Ligand Row</span>.</p>
<p>The actual structures can be defined in the <span class="GUI">Ligand
sketcher</span> section, either by choosing a template for the ligand, which you
can modify, or drawing the ligand structure in the sketcher. To draw a ligand,
choose <span class="GUI">Custom</span> from the <span
class="GUI">Template</span> option menu. When you have drawn or chosen a ligand,
click <span class="GUI">Use Current Structure</span> on the row in the <span
class="GUI">Ligands</span> section that you want to assign the structure to. The
ligand formula and whether the ligand is monodentate or bidentate is shown in
the ligand row. In addition, the number of occupied coordination sites listed
above the ligand rows is updated.
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose the arrangement of ligands in the complex. </p>
<p>For octahedral complexes with bidentate ligands, you can automatically
arrange them in a facial or meridional conformation, by choosing the isomer in
the <span class="GUI">Complex information</span> section. Both isomers are
chiral, but only one of the stereoisomers is built. The facial stereoisomer is
in the &Lambda; form, the meridional stereoisomer is in the &Delta; form. The
geometry is applied when you save the structure.  To convert to the other
stereoisomer, display the <span class="GUI">Build</span> toolbar, and
double-click the <span class="GUI">R/S</span> button. (If the ligand is
symmetric, there are only the two stereoisomers.) </p>
<p>For tetrahedral complexes with two pairs of monodentate ligands, you can
choose either the cis or the trans isomer in the <span class="GUI">Complex
information</span> section.
</p>
<p>
For any other type of complex, you must pick the sites on the metal atom for
each ligating atom on each ligand, by clicking <span class="GUI">Specify
Ligand Coordination Sites</span> and using the diagram of the complex in the
dialog box that opens to pick the sites for each ligand.
</p></li>
</ol>
<p>When you have finished defining the complex, click one of the action buttons
to save it, either to the Maestro project with <span class="GUI">Create Project
Entry</span> or to a file, with <span class="GUI">Write File</span>.
</p>

<p>If you want to create new ligand templates, choose <span
class="GUI">Custom</span> from the <span class="GUI">Template</span> option
menu, then draw the new ligand in the sketcher. You must indicate which atoms
are the ligating atoms, by adding a bond to them and labeling the terminal atom
as R<sub>1</sub> for the first ligating atom, and R<sub>2</sub> for the
second. Right-click on the atom and choose <span class="GUI">Set R Group &rarr;
R1</span> or <span class="GUI">R2</span> to perform the labeling.
Click <span class="GUI">Save New Template</span> to save the ligand structure
you drew, and name the structure in the dialog box that is displayed. The custom
templates are stored in your Schr&ouml;dinger user resources directory. 
</p>

<p>When you have built the complex, you should consider cleaning it up with
the <a href="ligand_cleanup.html"><span class="GUI">Ligand Cleanup</span>
panel</a>, and then running a geometry optimization with Jaguar before
proceeding with any calculations on the complex.

<dd><p>For octahedral complexes, this option menu allows you
to specify whether the complex is facial or meridional. This choice is only
available if you use three copies of a bidentate ligand, or three copies of two
monodentate ligands. For asymmetric bidentate ligands, the facial isomer is the
&Lambda; stereoisomer, the meridional isomer is the &Delta; stereoisomer. (If 
the ligands are symmetric, there are only the two stereoisomers, which are built
by choosing the facial or meridional isomer.)</p>
<p>For square planar complexes consisting of two pairs of monodentate ligands,
you can choose to build either the cis or the trans isomer from this option menu. 
</p></dd>

<a name="feature1.4"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Title</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>Specify the title for the complex. This title is used as the entry title
when the complex is exported to a file or added to the Project Table.
</p></dd>

</dl>

<a name="feature2"></a>
<h3>Ligands section</h3>
<p>In this section, you specify how many different ligands you want to use,
how many of each ligand to use, and how to arrange the ligands.  The number of
occupied coordination sites is shown at the top of the section.
</p>
<dl>

<a name="feature2.1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Add Ligand Row</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Add a row of controls for another ligand. By default, one ligand row is
displayed.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature2.4"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Occupied coordination sites</span> display</dt>
<dd><p>This text area shows the number of coordination sites that are occupied
by the ligands specified in the Ligand rows. The value is updated when you
click <span class="GUI">Use Current Structure</span> to add a ligand to a row. 
</p></dd>

<a name="feature2.2"></a>
<dt>Ligand row</dt>
<dd><p>Each ligand row has a set of controls for specifying a ligand. 
</p>
<dl>
<dt><span class="GUI">Copies</span> box</dt>
<dd><p>Set the number of copies by typing the number into the text box, or use
the arrow buttons to set the number. Changing the number of copies changes the
information on occupation of the coordination sites if a ligand has been
assigned to the row. 
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Use Current Structure</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Click this button to use the structure that is currently displayed in the
sketcher for this ligand. The structure must have one or two R groups, labeled
R<sub>1</sub> for the first and R<sub>2</sub> for the second, if the ligand is
bidentate. When you click this button, the ligand information and the
information on occupation of the coordination sites is updated.
</p></dd>
<dt>Ligand information</dt>
<dd><p>The formula of the ligand and whether it is monodentate or bidentate is
displayed to the right of the <span class="GUI">Use Current Structure</span>
button. This information is displayed when you click <span class="GUI">Use
Current Structure</span>. Pausing the pointer over the information shows the 2D
structure of the ligand in a tooltip. 
</p></dd>
<dt>Delete button</dt>
<dd><p>Click this button (red X) to delete the ligand row. 
</p></dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<a name="feature2.3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Specify Ligand Coordination Sites</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Specify the coordination sites for the ligands explicitly, by selecting
each site on a diagram of the complex. Opens a dialog box, in which all copies
of the ligand are listed with their attachment points. Clicking on a site in
the diagram associates the site with the selected attachment point. By default
the first attachment point is selected, and the selection moves to the next
point (top down, left-right order) when the association is made.
</p></dd>

</dl>

<a name="feature3"></a>
<h3>Ligand sketcher section</h3>
<p>The ligand sketcher allows you to modify a template structure for a
ligand, or add your own structures.
</p>
<dl>

<a name="feature3.1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Template</span> option menu</dt>
<dd><p>This option menu offers a set of template ligand molecules that you can
use directly or edit to create the ligand that you want. When you choose one of
the templates, the structure is displayed in the sketcher. You can then edit it
with the sketcher tools. </p>
<p>If you choose <span class="GUI">Custom</span>, you can draw your own ligand
in the sketcher. When you have created your ligand, you must draw in a bond from
the ligating atom or atoms to a potential metal atom, and label the terminal
atom on the bond with <span class="GUI">R1</span>, or <span
class="GUI">R2</span> for the second ligating atom of a bidentate ligand. To
label the atom, you can either pause the pointer over the atom and type in the
label, or right-click on the atom and choose <span class="GUI">Set R Group
&rarr; R1</span> (or <span class="GUI">R2</span>). The labeled terminal atom is
replaced by the metal when the complex is constructed. If the ligand forms a
dative bond, you must still add a bond and label it, even if it violates the
valence of the ligating atom.</p>
<p>The menu is reordered each time you choose a ligand, so that the last chosen
is at the top. 
</p></dd>

<a name="feature3.2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Clear Sketcher</span> button</dt>
