<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Define the surface that is to be used for the planar interface on which the
disordered system is built.</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Define Interface Dialog Box</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Define Interface</span> dialog box, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Click <span class="GUI">Define Interface</span> in the 
<span class="GUI">Disordered System Builder</span> panel.</p></li>
</ul>


<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Define Interface Dialog Box</h2> 


<p>When you choose the plane for the interface, you should make sure that it is
on the surface (at least approximately), as no changes are made to the
substrate. So if you want a particular crystal plane, for example, you should
make sure that the crystal plane is exposed (at the surface) in the structure
you choose for your substrate.
</p>

<p>You can specify a gap on both sides of the disordered system. If they are
zero, you will get a &quot;sandwich&quot; system, in which layers of substrate
and the amorphous substance alternate and are in contact with each other.
Specifying a large gap between the top of the amorphous region and the image of
the substrate allows you to simulate a system in 3D that approximates a 2D
system.

<dl>

<a name="feature1">
<dt><span class="GUI">Best fit to all atoms</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Select this option to define the interface plane as the best fit to all
atoms in the structure. As the fitting on its own will place the plane in the
middle of the substrate, the plane is moved after fitting so that it rests on
the surface of the structure. 
</p></dd>

<a name="feature2">
<dt><span class="GUI">Crystal vector</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Select this option to define the interface as the plane that is
perpendicular to one of the crystal vectors and at the surface of the substrate,
and select the vector (<span class="GUI">a</span>, <span class="GUI">b</span>,
or <span class="GUI">c</span>).
</p></dd>

<a name="feature3">
<dt><span class="GUI">Choose at least 3 atoms to define the plane</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Define the interface plane as the best fit to the chosen atoms.
Select <span class="GUI">Pick</span> and pick the atoms in the Workspace. The
plane is fit to the atoms as you pick, after the third atom is picked, and the
plane and arrow marker in the Workspace are centered at the centroid of the
picked atoms. No adjustment is made to place the plane at the surface of the
substrate.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature4">
<dt><span class="GUI">Flip Direction</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Flip the direction of growth of the disordered system. The arrow
indicates the direction of growth; the plane indicates the location of the
interface between the substrate and the disordered system. If you
chose <span class="GUI">Crystal vector</span> or <span class="GUI">Best fit to
all atoms</span> to define the interface, the opposite side of the structure is
used for the interface: the plane is moved in the Workspace to the opposite
surface of the substrate structure and the arrow points in the opposite
direction. If you picked atoms to define the plane, it is assumed that you chose
the desired interface plane, but the direction of growth is incorrect. In this
case, the plane stays where it is but the arrow direction changes.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature5">
<dt><span class="GUI">Buffer between surface and components</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>Specify the minimum distance of any atom in the surface to any atom in
any molecule in the disordered system. This allows you to create a gap between
the substrate and the disordered system.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature6">
<dt><span class="GUI">Buffer between components and surface mirror image in the periodic box</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>Specify the minimum distance of any atom in the substrate in its image in
the next cell above the surface to any atom in any molecule in the disordered
system. This allows you to create a gap between the top of the disordered system
and the next occurrence in that direction of the substrate in a periodic
system. By making this value large, you can obtain an approximation to an
isolated surface rather than one that is periodic in 3D.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature7">
<dt><span class="GUI">Reset</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Reset the settings to their default values.
</p></dd>
