<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Calculate the change in energy for dissociating molecules into combinations
of two fragments that come from breaking covalent non-ring single bonds
(homolytic dissociation) or removing ligands from a metal atom. All possible
fragments or a restricted set of fragments can be selected for calculation.</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Bond and Ligand Dissociation Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Bond and Ligand Dissociation</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Applications &rarr; Materials Science &rarr; Bond and Ligand Dissociation</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Tasks &rarr; Quantum Mechanics &rarr; Bond and Ligand Dissociation</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Using the Bond and Ligand Dissociation Panel</h2> 


<p>When specifying the bonds to break, you can apply restrictions on top of the
choice of a single acyclic bond. You can include bonds to hydrogen along with
other atoms, you can restrict the choice to break only bonds to hydrogen, or you
can exclude bonds to hydrogen. As well as restricting bonds to hydrogen, there
is a more general feature for either including or excluding bonds based on
whether any atom in the bond is in a match to a set of SMARTS patterns.
</p>

<p>The calculations are run with Jaguar, and the geometry of each reactant and
product is optimized. To maximize efficiency, a unique set of fragments for the
entire input is assembled, and calculations are performed on the unique
fragments.
</p>

<p>The results of the bond dissociation calculation are returned as a set of
entries for each reaction, which contain the reactant and product structures for
that reaction, and a set of individual reactant and product structures. </p>

<p>In the entries for each reaction, the reaction energy is added as a property,
the broken bond is marked on the reactant structure, and the atoms on each end of
the broken bond are marked on the product structures. The reactant structure is
placed with the broken bond on the <i>x</i> axis, on the negative end. The
product structures are placed on the positive side of the <i>x</i> axis, and
displaced in the <i>y</i> direction so they don't overlap. They have the same
orientation as in the reactant structure.  For polydentate ligands, each atom
that ligates the metal is marked, and each metal-ligand bond is marked in the
reactant; the average of the vectors for the broken bonds is aligned on the 
<i>x</i> axis in this case.
</p>
<p>In the individual structures, the reaction products are titled &quot;fragment
# X&quot;, where # is the index of the fragment and X gives information about
the state. The job name is also appended to the title, so that you can
distinguish the results of different runs.

<p>
Clicking the button shows a small job status window that lists the job name and
status for all active jobs submitted from the current panel (for Jaguar and
MacroModel this means all jobs from any of the application panels). You can
double-click on a row to open the <a href="../misc/monitor_panel.html"><span
class="GUI">Monitor</span> panel</a> and monitor the job, or click the <span
class="GUI">Monitor</span> button to open the <span class="GUI">Monitor</span>
panel and close the job status window. The job status is updated while the
window is open. If a job finishes while the window is open, the job remains
displayed but with the new status.  The rows are colored according to the
status: yellow for submitted, green for launched, running, or finished, red for
incorporated, died, or killed.  Click anywhere outside the window to close it.
