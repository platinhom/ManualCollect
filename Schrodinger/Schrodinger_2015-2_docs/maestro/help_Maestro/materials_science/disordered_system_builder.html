<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Build a randomized multi-component organic mixture of a given composition,
either on its own, or on a substrate. The substrate can be a crystal surface,
the exterior of a nanoparticle, or the interior of a &quot;container&quot; such
as a nanotube. The resulting structure can be prepared for molecular dynamics
simulations.
</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Disordered System Builder Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Disordered System Builder</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Applications &rarr; Materials Science &rarr; Disordered System Builder</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Tasks &rarr; Materials &rarr; Disordered System Builder</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
</ul>


<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Disordered System Builder Panel</h2> 


<p>This panel allows you to create a disordered system from a single compound or
a mixture of organic compounds of a given composition, either on its own, or on
a substrate. The system that is constructed can be prepared for Desmond
molecular dynamics simulations.
</p>
<p>The basic input is a set of molecules, which can be a set of entries in the
Project Table or in a single file that contains only the desired molecules. You
choose the proportions of each molecule in the mixture, and the total number of
molecules to place in the simulation box. If you want a pure substance rather
than a mixture, you can simply choose a single molecule as input. However, you
can also choose to build homogeneous cells of each component, in addition to the
mixture, in the <span class="GUI">Cells</span> section. 
</p>
<p>The proportions or percentages that you specify must be regarded as a target
value, as there must be an integer number of molecules in the disordered system.
The larger the number of molecules in the box, the closer the actual proportions
will be to the target values. Of course, the resources for the simulation also
increase with the number of atoms in the simulation, and also resources for
display of results in Maestro. For guidance, Maestro can display up to about
500,000 atoms comfortably on a machine with 4GB memory, and a Desmond simulation
with about 100,000 atoms run on 8 cores would take about 1 day per ns of
simulation. If you are preparing a simulation box, you should in any case ensure
that the box is not too small - each side must be at least 20&nbsp;&Aring;,
which means a minimum of around 3000 atoms. 
</p>
<p>The cell containing the mixture can be replicated with different random
distributions and orientations of the components (but in the same proportions),
so that you can check the variation with initial conditions, or accumulate
statistics for the system. You can also create cells for each of the pure
compounds, and have multiple randomly distributed replicas of these as well.
</p>

<p>There are several choices for how the molecules are placed in the box, which
are given in the <span class="GUI">Disorder</span> section. An initial placement
is made, which can be followed by up to three stages of modification that can
relax the system, pack the system more densely, or minimize its energy.
</p>

<p>If you choose <span class="GUI">Snap to grid</span>, the molecules are chosen
at random and placed on a cubic grid, optionally with random orientation. The
box is filled up in order of increasing values of <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, then 
<i>z</i>. If the number of molecules is not a perfect cube, there is space
remaining at the top of the box, and the box side parameters are adjusted
afterwards. To ensure that the box does not have empty space that the MD
simulations must fill, you should choose the number of molecules so that only
one or two full layers of molecules are missing from the cube (that is,
<i>n</i><sup>3</sup>&minus;<i>n</i><sup>2</sup> 
or <i>n</i><sup>3</sup>&minus;2<i>n</i><sup>2</sup>).
</p>

<p>If you choose <span class="GUI">Amorphous</span> for the initial placement,
the molecules are chosen randomly, placed randomly, and oriented randomly,
inside the box. If after a specified number of attempts (set in
the <span class="GUI">Disorder Options</span> dialog box) to create a system
without clashes, the density or the van der Waals radii are decreased in order
to find a system without clashes.You can request that the density is maximized
after finding a system without clashes. 
</p>

<p>After the initial placement, you can perform any of the three post-placement
processes.</p>
<p>The first, <span class="GUI">Monte Carlo simulated annealing</span>, allows
you to translate and rotate the molecules at random at a set of decreasing
temperatures, using either a chosen force field, or an energy term that is
linear in the minimum distance between any atom in the molecule and any atom in
the substrate (or the center of the box, if there is no substrate), or both. The
linear term encourages molecules to move towards the substrate (or center). The
force field encourages molecules to move to more energetically favorable
locations, while ensuring that clashes do not occur. (If you don't use the force
field, clashes are avoided with a hard-sphere model.)
</p>
<p>The second, <span class="GUI">Steric pack</span>, attempts to maximize the
density of the system by moving molecules towards the substrate or the center of
the box (if there is no substrate). Packing is done by moving each molecule
towards the substrate or the origin in a straight line,  and the molecule is
placed in the nearest cavity to the substrate or the origin that has no steric
clashes. The process starts with the molecules that are closest to the 
substrate or origin and moves outwards.
</p>
<p>The third, <span class="GUI">Minimization</span>, attempts to minimize the
energy of the system using a chosen force field. 
</p>

<p>After these processes have been carried out, the box is refit to the final
system, to minimize the empty space. 
</p>

<p>If you select the option to prepare Desmond systems, the output consists of
one or more CMS (<code>.cms</code>) files, which you can use directly in Desmond
MD simulations.  The file containing the model system for the mixture is
named <i>jobname</i><code>.cms</code>, so you should choose a descriptive job
name (rather than the default). The files containing the model systems for the
components are named 
<i>jobname</i><code>-component</code><i>n</i><code>.cms</code>, where <i>n</i>
is the component number in the <span class="GUI">Components</span> table. If you
chose to generate multiple cells of each type, a suffix <code>_</code><i>N</i>
is added, where <i>N</i> indexes the replicas of each type.
</p>
<p>If you chose not to prepare Desmond systems, the output consists of Maestro
files that contain the periodic boundary condition properties, and are named in
the same way as the Desmond systems except with the suffix <code>.maegz</code>.

</ul>
</dd>
<a name="file_browse"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">File name</span> text box and <span
class="GUI">Browse</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>If you chose <span class="GUI">File</span> from the <span class="GUI">Use
structures from</span> option menu, enter the file name in this text box, or click <span class="GUI">Browse</span> and navigate to the structure file. 
The name of the file you selected is displayed in the text box.
The file must contain all the structures you want to use to build the system, and only these structures.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature1.1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Number of molecules</span> box</dt>
<dd><p>Enter the total number of molecules to include in the simulation box.</p>
<p>If you want to initialize the system by placing molecules on a grid, this
value is used to determine the cubic grid on which the molecules are placed: the
number of points in any direction is the cube root of the number of molecules,
rounded up to the nearest integer. To ensure that the simulation box does not
have any spaces, you should choose a number that is a perfect cube, or a number
that results in only one or two layers of molecules missing from the cube (that
is, <i>n</i><sup>3</sup>&minus;<i>n</i><sup>2</sup> or 
<i>n</i><sup>3</sup>&minus;2<i>n</i><sup>2</sup>). Other values will result in
incomplete layers of molecules that may take a long simulation time to fill. 
</p></dd>

<a name="feature1.2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Allow more than 10 components</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>By default, the maximum number of components is 10. You can override this
limit by selecting this option, and then the number of components is unlimited.
Including a large number of components will result in slow loading of the
components.
</p></dd>


<a name="components"></a>
<h3>Components section</h3>

<p>The table in this section lists the components that you selected for
inclusion in the simulation box. It is updated whenever you choose a structure
source. The percentages are initially set to be equal. You can edit the table
cells to change the composition. As you edit the cells, the values in the
unedited cells are adjusted so that the values add up to 100. Once you have
edited all cells, you can change any of the values, but the other values are no
longer adjusted.
</p>
<p>The percentages are used to determine the number of molecules of each type,
by multiplying them by the total number of molecules, and dividing by 100, then
rounding up to the nearest integer. The percentages or proportions you provide
will therefore not be exact, and must be regarded as a target value. However,
you must ensure that the number of molecules for each component, which is
reported in the <span class="GUI">Molecules</span> column, adds up to the total.
If it does not, you must adjust either the percentages or the number of
molecules, by editing either the percentage column or the <span
class="GUI">Molecules</span> column.</p>
<p>For example, if you have an odd number of molecules in a two-component
mixture, the default percentages are both 50, and the number of molecules does
not add up to the total, as both are rounded up. You must change one of the
components to have one more molecule than the other.

where the molecules are placed with respect to the substrate.
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Immersed</span>&mdash;The molecules are placed all
around the substrate, so that it is immersed in the disordered system. Choose
this option for building a model system on the surface of a nanoparticle or a
quantum dot, or for a structure surrounded by mixed solvent, for example. The
initial cubic box is made large enough to fit a monolayer around the substrate.
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Container</span>&mdash;The molecules are placed inside
a void in the substrate. Choose this option for placing molecules inside a
nanotube, a zeolite, or a metal-organic framework, for example.
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Planar interface</span>&mdash;The molecules are placed
on one surface of the substrate. Choose this option for placing molecules on a
particular crystal plane, an amorphous organic material layer, or a chemically
functionalized surface, for example. To define the plane and the spacing between
the surface and the disordered system, click <span class="GUI">Define
interface</span>.

surface. If the substrate surface is not rectangular, it will not cover the
entire width and breadth of the box. 
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Use substrate periodic boundary
condition</span>&mdash;Use the periodic boundary condition that already exists
on the substrate. The crystal vector that you chose for the periodic boundary
condition is expanded to include the disordered system. If the crystal vector is

to separate files with an index to identify the replicas. Having multiple cells
with the same composition but different random placement of the components can
be useful for checking the dependence of the results on the initial conditions,
or for accumulating statistics about the system.
