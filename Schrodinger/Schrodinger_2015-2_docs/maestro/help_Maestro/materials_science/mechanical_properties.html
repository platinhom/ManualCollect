<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Calculate strain properties of an orthorhombic system using molecular dynamics
simulations. The properties are obtained by fitting, using small changes to the
cell dimensions.</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Elastic Constants Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Elastic Constants</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Applications &rarr; Materials Science &rarr; Elastic Constants</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Tasks &rarr; Materials &rarr; Elastic Constants</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
</ul>


<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Elastic Constants Panel</h2> 


<p>The elastic constants are calculated by compressing or expanding the unit
cell of the relaxed system along the three crystal axes or by changing the cell
angles, running a minimization on the deformed cell at constant volume, and then
using a quadratic fit to the results to obtain the elastic constants. The
relaxed system is obtained by running an optional MD relaxation step on the
input system, followed by a minimization.</p>
<p> 
The full list of available properties is:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Tension Anistropy</li>
<li>Shear Anistropy</li>
<li>Lam&eacute; Lambda</li>
<li>Lam&eacute; Mu</li>
<li>Young's Modulus</li>
<li>Shear Modulus</li>
<li>Lam&eacute; Bulk Modulus</li>
<li>Poisson Ratio</li>
</ul>
<p>These properties are included as Maestro properties of the relaxed system in
the output. Some of these might not be computed, depending on the options you
select for the simulations. 
</p>
<p><b>To calculate elastic constants:</b>
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Load a model system that has been prepared for Desmond simulations.
</p></li>
<li><p>Select options for the strain calculations that you want done, in the
<span class="GUI">Strain calculations</span> section. You must choose at least
two options.
</p></li>
<li><p>If your model system has not been through a relaxation stage, select
<span class="GUI">Relaxation</span>. 
</p></li>
<li><p>If you want to change the defaults for minimization of the deformed
system, set the maximum number of iterations and the convergence threshold on
the gradient.
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose the structures to add to the project when the job finishes. All
the properties are part of the (relaxed) input system, so you only need the
deformed systems if you particularly want to examine their structure. 
</p></li>
<li><p>Enter a job name and start the job.
</p></li>
</ol>

<dt><span class="GUI">Model system</span> section</dt>
<dd><p>Specify the model system, which must be already prepared for a Desmond
simulation. 
You can use the <a href="../desmond/system_builder.html"><span class="GUI">System
Builder</span> panel</a> to prepare the model system if you already have the
structure available. If you want to build the model system from a set of organic
components, you can use the <a href="disordered_system_builder.html"><span 
class="GUI">Disordered System Builder</span> panel</a>. 
</p>
<p>The option menu offers two choices for the source of the model system:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Load from Workspace</span>&mdash;Load the model system
from the Workspace. When you choose this option,
the <span class="GUI">Load</span> button is displayed to the right of the menu. 
Click this button to load the model system.
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Import from file</span>&mdash;Import the model system
from a file, which must be a Desmond CMS file. When you choose this
option, a text box and <span class="GUI">Browse</span> button are displayed to
the right of the menu. You can enter the name of the file in the text box, or
click <span class="GUI">Browse</span> and navigate to the file. 
</p></li>
</ul>
</dd>

<a name="feature2">
<dt><span class="GUI">Strain calculations</span> section</dt>
<dd><p>Select options for the strain property to calcualate, and specify the
number and the size of the increments in the box dimensions (<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>,
and <i>c</i>) used for fitting to obtain the strain properties. The number of
increments n includes both positive and negative increments, so the number of
points and hence number of simulations in any given dimension (or combination)
is 2n. The increment &epsilon; is a fraction of the cell dimension, so for
example the value of <i>a</i> is incremented to <i>a</i>(1&plusmn;k&epsilon;),
where k runs from 1 to n.</p>

<p>The accuracy of the properties depends on both the number of increments and
the size of the increments. Smaller increments decrease the error due to
fitting, but also decrease the precision of the strain properties due to smaller
differences between the values that are being subtracted. Using more increments
decreases the error due to higher-order terms in the fit, but increases the
cost.
</p>
<p>You must choose at least two of the three calculation types.

window is open. If a job finishes while the window is open, the job remains
displayed but with the new status.  The rows are colored according to the
status: yellow for submitted, green for launched, running, or finished, red for
incorporated, died, or killed.  Click anywhere outside the window to close it.
