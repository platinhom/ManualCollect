<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Display a simple graphical representation of various metrics that indicate
the reliability or quality of a protein structure, and in particular, X-ray
structures of proteins. 
</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Protein Reliability Report Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Protein Reliability Report</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Tools &rarr; Protein Structure Assessment &rarr; Protein Reliability Report</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
</ul>


<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Protein Reliability Report Panel</h2> 


<p>To analyze a protein for reliability, you must first display it in the
Workspace. If a report has already been generated for a protein, and it is
displayed in the Workspace, the report is displayed immediately. 
</p>

<p>The metrics that are used to assess the quality of the protein structure are
described below, with the threshold values for marking a problem. Some metrics
require X-ray reflection data for their evaluation. Some apply to the entire
protein, others apply to the region that is analyzed. 
</p>

<a name="feature1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Analyze</span> option menu and tools</dt>
<dd><p>Choose the part of the protein to analyze from this option menu. There
are three choices:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Entire structure</span>&mdash;Analyze the entire
structure that is in the Workspace. 
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Region around ligand</span>&mdash;Analyze the region
that includes the ligand and all residues that have atoms within a specified
distance of the ligand. The default distance is 10&nbsp;&Aring;, and can be
changed in the <span class="GUI">Shell</span> text box.</p>
<p>When you choose this option, a text box and a <span class="GUI">Pick
ligand</span> option are displayed to the left of the menu. To identify the
ligand, select the <span class="GUI">Pick ligand</span> option and pick a ligand
atom in the Workspace. The identity of the ligand is displayed in the text box.
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Custom region</span>&mdash;Analyze the region
that includes a selected set of residues.</p>
<p>When you choose this option, a text box and a <span class="GUI">Select</span>
button are displayed to the left of the menu. To select the residues that define
the region, click <span class="GUI">Select</span> and use the tools in the <a
href="../misc/asd.html"><span class="GUI">Atom Selection</span> dialog box</a>.
The <a href="../misc/asl.html">ASL</a> expression for these residues is
displayed in the text box.

<dd><p>If you want to include X-ray diffraction data in the analysis, select
this option and click <span class="GUI">Browse</span>. A file selector opens, in
which you can locate and select the file that contains the diffraction data. The
file name is displayed in the text box. You can also type the full file name
into the text box. The X-ray data are used to calculate real-space R-factors and
correlation coefficients.  
</p></dd>

<a name="feature5"></a>

entire protein (<span class="GUI">All</span>).
</p></dd>

<a name="feature6"></a>
<dt>Display area</dt>
<dd><p>This area displays a visual representation of the metrics for protein
reliability. For each metric a circle is drawn that represents the quality of
that metric. It is colored red if the deviation from acceptable values is larger
than a threshold, and green if the deviation is smaller. The radius of the
circle indicates the magnitude of the metric. Circles are still drawn for metrics
that were not calculated, but they are not colored. For large deviations, the
circles can overlap other circles. </p>
<p>The intention of the display is to provide a quick means of determining if
the protein structure is reliable, and which aspects of the structure deviate
from acceptable values.</p>
<p>If you click on the title of a metric, the values for that metric are
displayed in a table, to the right. 
</p></dd>

<a name="feature7"></a>
<dt>Results table</dt>
<dd><p>For metrics whose values lie outside acceptable ranges, the unacceptable
values are displayed in a table in this section. The section is blank initially,
and is cleared if you choose a metric whose values are all acceptable. 
</p></dd>

<a name="feature8"></a>
<dt>Information area</dt>
<dd><p>This area displays an informational message on metrics whose values lie
outside the acceptable range, when you click on the metric in the display
area. It specifies the cutoff for acceptable values, and suggests possible
reasons that the values might lie outside the range.  
</p></dd>

<a name="feature9"></a>

a menu, from which you can make settings or perform actions that are related to
the job. </p>
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/settings.png" />
<p>The menu items are described below.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="GUI">Job Settings</span>&mdash;Make and save settings for the
incorporation of the job into the Maestro project, the job name, the host,
the distribution of subjobs, and any other application-specific job settings.
Opens the <span class="GUI">Job Settings</span> dialog box.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Preferences</span>&mdash;Set general preferences for
running jobs. Opens the <span class="GUI">Preferences</span> panel at the <a

<li><span class="GUI">Reset Panel</span>&mdash;Reset the values in the panel to 
their defaults.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Job status</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>This icon indicates when there are jobs running for the application that
belong to the current project. It starts spinning when the first job starts, and
stops when there are no more jobs running. If a job fails to start, it changes
to an exclamation point. 
</p>
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/job_status.png" />
<p>
Clicking the button shows a small job status window that lists the job name and
status for all active jobs submitted from the current panel (for Jaguar and
MacroModel this means all jobs from any of the application panels). You can
double-click on a row to open the <a href="../misc/monitor_panel.html"><span
class="GUI">Monitor</span> panel</a> and monitor the job, or click the <span
class="GUI">Monitor</span> button to open the <span class="GUI">Monitor</span>
panel and close the job status window. The job status is updated while the
window is open. If a job finishes while the window is open, the job remains
displayed but with the new status.  The rows are colored according to the
status: yellow for submitted, green for launched, running, or finished, red for
incorporated, died, or killed.  Click anywhere outside the window to close it.

<dd><p>The status bar displays information about the current job settings for the
panel. This includes the job name, task name and task settings (if any), number
of subjobs (if any) and the host name and job incorporation setting. It also
displays a message for a short time when you start a new job.</p>
<p>The status bar also contains the <span class="GUI">Help</span> button, which
