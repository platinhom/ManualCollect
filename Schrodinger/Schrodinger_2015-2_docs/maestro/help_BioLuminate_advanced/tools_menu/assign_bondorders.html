<p>The <span class="GUI">Assign Bond Orders</span> command under
<span class="GUI">Edit &rarr; Advanced Edit Options</span> 
assigns bond orders to structures that do not have the correct bond orders. Bond
orders are assigned as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If you have a Workspace selection that is 300 atoms or less, bond orders
are assigned for all the selected atoms.
</p></li>
<li><p>If the selection has more than 300 atoms, bond orders are
assigned for all residues in the selection that do not have multiple bonds.
</p></li>
<li><p>If there is no selection, bond orders are assigned for all residues in
the Workspace that do not have multiple bonds.
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The assignment is based on a range of factors, including connectivity, bond
length, bond angles and dihedral angles. Occasionally the bond order cannot be
assigned, or is assigned incorrectly. You should always check your structure
after using this command, especially for bonds that are unusual in any way. If
you find any errors, you can correct them with the buttons on the 
<a href="../tool_bar/main_build_toolbar.html"><span class="GUI">Build</span>
toolbar</a>.</p>

<p>Assignment of bond orders is a necessary preliminary to hydrogen addition. If
the bond orders are incorrect, hydrogen addition will place too many or too few
hydrogen atoms.</p>
