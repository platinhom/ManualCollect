<p>The purpose of MCPRO+ linear response calculations is to provide data for
the generation of linear response models, for example using 
<a href="../strike/strike_intro.html">Strike</a> to fit the data.</p>

<p>You can set up and run a relative binding affinity calculation in the 
<span class="GUI">MCPRO+ Linear Response</span> panel, 
which you open by choosing 
<span class="GUI">Applications &rarr; MCPRO+ &rarr; Linear Response</span>.
The general layout and common features of this panel are described in the topic
<a href="mcpro_panel.html">MCPRO+ Panels</a>.
</p>

<p>The input required for a linear response calculation is a ligand file and a
prepared protein model system in the same frame of reference. The structural
input is the same as required for Liaison and Prime MM-GBSA calculations, but
the protein must be prepared as a model system beforehand, for example by
setting up the model system for an MC Sampling job for a protein only. There is
no need to run the job or write the input files&mdash;the Z-matrix is written at
the end of the model system creation automatically. </p>
R
<p>When the job is run, MCPRO+ creates model systems for each of the ligands and
their complexes. The bound Monte Carlo sampling run is similar to that done for
other job types. The free ligand Monte Carlo sampling includes a step in which
the ligand bond lengths and angles are held fixed and only the torsions and
relative orientation are varied, with a much higher temperature used in the
Metropolis criterion for ligand moves. This step and the subsequent quenching
in the next equilibration allows higher-energy configurations to be sampled and
thus a greater probability of moving over torsional barriers. </p>

<p>The principal output from a linear response calculation is written to the file 
<i>jobname</i><code>.csv</code>, which is compiled from data for the bound and
the free systems. The results in this file can be used to generate a model of
binding affinities. The file has the following properties:</p>
