<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>This panel provides a means of interacting with the Workspace and the project
that is similar to PyMOL.
</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Toggle Table Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Toggle Table</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">File &rarr; Toggle Table</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Window &rarr; Show &rarr; Toggle Table</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
</ul>


<p>This panel is dockable, so it opens by default in the Workspace. You can
change this behavior in the <a href="../maestro_menu/preferences.html"><span
class="GUI">Preferences</span> panel</a>, under <span class="GUI">General
&ndash; Panels</span>.
</p>

<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Toggle Table Panel</h2> 


<p>The Toggle Table provides easy ways to manipulate the Workspace.  Either the
entire Workspace or individual entries can operated on.  Menus provide easy ways
to change the color, representation style, and labeling of entries.  Various 
chemical features can be displayed or hidden, groups of atoms can be selected, 
and simple properties can be calculated.</p>
<p>The central section of the Toggle Table lists all entries in the Workspace.
Clicking on the name of an entry toggles the visibility of that entry.  
<b>However, it is important to note that even if an entry is not visible, it is
still in the Workspace as long as it is listed in the Toggle Table.  This means
that all Workspace operations will be applied to this entry.  Panels that offer
to &quot;Analyze the Workspace&quot; or &quot;Import from Workspace&quot; will
operate on these  entries, even if they are not visible and the entry name is
greyed out.</b>  To 
remove (exclude) an entry from the workspace, use the <span class="GUI">Remove
from Workspace</span> command under the <span class="GUI">A</span> menu for that
entry, or exclude it using the Project Table.</p>

<p>In addition to the docked panel, the Toggle Table also provides a right-click
context menu in the workspace for easy access to many of its features. This 
menu is available by right-clicking and holding anywhere in the workspace.  The 
contents of the context menu depend on whether the click occurs on an atom 
(which selects the atom) or empty space.</p>

<h3>Quick Access Buttons</h3>

<p>This set of buttons provides quick access to a number of actions, some of
which are also on the menus. 
</p>

<dl>
<a name="feature1.1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Reset</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Resets the view to its default view, in which the view axes are
aligned with the coordinate axes of the structure.</p></dd>

<a name="feature1.2"></a>

<dt><span class="GUI">Orient</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Provides an optimal view of the Workspace structures.  This is
accomplished by translating and rotating the structure in the Workspace so that
the center of mass is at the origin, the largest principal axis lies on the
<i>x</i> axis, and the  second-largest principal axis lies on the <i>y</i>
axis.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> This operation changes the coordinates of the structures, not
just the coordinates of the view.

<h3>Entries in the Workspace Region</h3>

<p>This region of the Toggle Table has a row for each entry in the
Workspace, plus additional types of objects. The buttons in these rows open
menus that operate on the objects for that row.</p>
<p>
There are three distinct types of rows in this table:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Entry rows</b>: These rows apply to a single entry that is
currently in the workspace. The name of the row is the Title of the
entry that its menu items apply to. Entry rows are deleted when the entry is
excluded from the Workspace, and a new row is added when an entry is added to
the Workspace</li>
<li><b>The All row</b>: This row applies to all atoms in the Workspace.
</li>
<li><b>Selection rows</b>: When a group of atoms is selected, a Selection row is
added to the Entry Region. Actions in this row apply to the group of atoms that
was selected to create this row and even apply after those atoms are no
longer selected. The Selection row named <span class="GUI">(Selection)</span>
always refers to the most recent group of selected atoms. Selection rows can be
renamed: renamed Selection rows always refer to the same set of atoms
regardless of subsequent Workspace selections. Selection rows are deleted when
any atoms they refer to are removed from the Workspace. Only one selection can
be active at a time. </li>
</ul>
<p>Some operations or menu items change based on whether they are being
applied to the All row, an Entry row, or a Selection row. The
descriptions below describe the behavior for Entry rows. When a
behavior changes for the All row or a Selection row, the change is
noted after the description.</p>
<p>
Any Entry row in this table refers to an entry that is currently in the
Workspace whether that entry is visible or not. This means that the
entry it refers to is affected by actions in the All row, and also that
it will be analyzed or imported by panels that operate on the Workspace.</p>

<dl>
<a name="feature10a"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Name</span></dt>
<dd><p>Clicking on the name of an All or an Entry row toggles the
visibility of that object in the Workspace. When the object's
visibility is off, the name is greyed out.</p>
<p>
<b>However, it is important to note that even if an entry is not visible, it is
still in the Workspace as long as it is listed in the Toggle Table.  This means
that all Workspace operations are applied to this entry.  Panels that offer
to &quot;Analyze the Workspace&quot; or &quot;Import from Workspace&quot; will
operate on these entries, even if they are not visible and the entry name is
greyed out.</b></p> 
For instance, if the Workspace contains ten entries and only one entry is
visible, selecting the <span class="GUI">Clean</span> action in the All row's
<span class="GUI">A</span> menu operates on all ten structures. This may
take a considerable amount of time to complete and lead to unexpected
results. Also, in this example, if a panel tries to Import from Workspace, it
attempts to import all ten structures rather than just the visible
structure.
<p>
<b>Note:</b> the interactions between toggling visiblity by clicking on the
Name, hiding atoms with the various <span class="GUI">Hide</span>
menu commands, and including/excluding entries from the Workspace can
result in a situation where the name is not greyed out but no atoms are
visible. Should this occur, simply choose to show the atoms using one
of the commands in the <span class="GUI">Show</span> menu.</p>
<p>Clicking the name of a Selection row toggles the selection state
of the atom group that row refers to. Any currently selected atoms that
are not part of this atom group are deselected.

<a name="feature10rename"></a>
<li><span class="GUI">Rename</span>&mdash;Change the name of the entry. This
changes the name displayed in the Toggle Table and also the Title property of
the structure.<br> 
This command is not available for the All row.<br>
For Selection rows, Rename Selection means that the renamed row
persistently refers to the same set of atoms even after a new group of
atoms is selected.<br></li>

<a name="feature10newstructure"></a>
<li><span class="GUI">Duplicate</span>&mdash;For Entry rows, create a new
project entry that is the duplicate of this entry. Both structures remain in the
Workspace.<br>
This command is not available for the All row.<br>
For Selection rows, this merely creates a duplicate Selection row in the Toggle
Table. No project entry is created.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Remove from Workspace</span>&mdash;Remove (exclude) this
entry from the Workspace. The entry remains in the Project Table and can be
returned (included) to the Workspace by using the <span class="GUI">Include in

This command is not available for Selection rows.<br>

<a name="feature10delete"></a>
<li><span class="GUI">Delete from Project</span>&mdash;Remove this structure
from the Workspace and the Project.  It no longers appear in the Project
Table.<br> 
For the All row, Delete Selections removes any Selection rows from the

For Selection rows Delete Selection just removes the row from the Toggle
Table. The atoms in this selection group are deselected but otherwise
remain unaltered.<br></li>
<li><span class="GUI">Copy to New Project Entry</span>&mdash;Create a new
project entry by copying the selected atoms or entries. The new entry is added to
the Workspace. For individual entries, this command is the same as <span

areas. Solvent-Accessible surface area (SASA) uses a solvent 
radius of 1.4&nbsp;&Aring; while Molecular Surface Area uses the same
algorithm but with no solvent to expand the atomic radii. The surface area is
computed for the object in the context of the visible atoms in the
Workspace.</li>
</ul>
The computed properties are displayed in a window that opens, and you can copy
and paste the text. 
</ul>

</dd>

<a name="feature10c"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">S</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Opens the Show menu, also referred to as the
<span class="GUI">S</span> menu.</p>
<p>The Show menu contains commands that alter the display of structures
in the Workspace. There are three different types of display for
structures:</p>
<ul>
<li>Atomic representations such as lines, sticks, ball and sticks or spheres</li>
<li>Ribbon representations such as ribbons and cartoons</li>
<li>Surface representations such as solid or mesh surfaces</li>
</ul>
<p>Each atom may have one of each representation type active at once,
but cannot have multiple representations of the same type active. For
instance, an atom can be shown simultaneously with lines, cartoon
ribbons and a mesh surface. However, an atom cannot be shown
simultaneously by both ball and stick and sphere representations
because they are both atomic representations. If an action is chosen to
show an atom with a representation in the same category as an existing
representation for that atom, the existing representation is removed
and the atom is shown with the new representation. For instance, if an
atom is shown as Lines, and the ball and stick menu item is chosen, the
Lines representation is removed and the atom is shown with
ball and stick representation.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="GUI">As</span>&mdash;This submenu contains menu items that
appear to be duplicates of those described below. However, selecting them from
the <span class="GUI">As</span> submenu removes any current 
representation of <i>any</i> of the three types for that atom and
replaces them all with the selected representation. For instance, an
atom shown with lines and cartoon ribbons is shown as only ball
and stick if <span class="GUI">Show &rarr; As &rarr; Ball and Stick</span> is
chosen, but are shown as cartoon and ball and stick if <span
class="GUI">Show &rarr; Ball and Stick</span> is chosen.</li> 
<li><span class="GUI">Lines</span>&mdash;Set atomic representation to lines</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Sticks</span>&mdash;Set atomic representation to sticks</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Ball and Stick</span>&mdash;Set atomic representation to
ball and stick</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Ribbon</span>&mdash;Set ribbon representation to ribbon.
This is the Maestro ribbon style known as calphatube or CA trace tube.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Cartoon</span>&mdash;Set ribbon representation to
cartoons.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Label</span>&mdash;Show any labels defined for this
structure.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Nonbonded</span>&mdash;Set the atomic representation of any
atom with 0 attachments to Lines (wire frame).</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Spheres</span>&mdash;Set the atomic representation to
Spheres (CPK).</li> 
<li><span class="GUI">Nonbonded Spheres</span>&mdash;Set the atomic
representation of any atom with 0 attachments to spheres (CPK).</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Mesh</span>&mdash;Set the surface representation to mesh
colored by current atom color.<br>
This command is not available for Selection rows.<br></li>
<li><span class="GUI">Surface</span>&mdash;Set the surface representation to
solid colored by current atom color.
This command is not available for Selection rows.<br></li>
<li><span class="GUI">Organic</span>&mdash;Set the atomic representation of
