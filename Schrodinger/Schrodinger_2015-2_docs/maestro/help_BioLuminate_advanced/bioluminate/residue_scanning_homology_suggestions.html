<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Identify candidate residues for mutation, using homology modeling or structural
criteria. Homology modeling can be applied to select residues by variability or
conservation. Structural criteria can be applied for solvent accessible surface
area and interactions (contacts) with the protein or a selected molecule. </p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Homology Suggestions Dialog Box</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Homology Suggestions</span> dialog box, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Tasks &rarr; Residue Scanning / Affinity Maturation &rarr; Perform Calculations</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
<li><p>Click <span class="GUI">Homology Criteria</span> in the 
<span class="GUI">Residue Scanning</span> panel.</p></li>
</ul>


<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Homology Suggestions Dialog Box</h2> 


<p>The main tasks in this panel are to create a homology model for one of the
protein chains, select residues by applying criteria based on the homologs,
optionially select criteria based on the 3D structure of the protein, then apply
the selection to the residue table in the <span class="GUI">Residue
Scanning</span> panel by clicking <span class="GUI">Save</span>. 
</p>
<p>The homologs used in the model can be imported (click 
<span class="GUI">Import homologs</span>) or located by running a BLAST
search. The homologs must then be aligned, which you can do manually or by
running an alignment (click <span class="GUI">Align Homologs</span> or the
toolbar alignment buttons).

sequence editing, and finding patterns in a sequence. </p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Import homologs</span> button&mdash;Import sequences
into the sequence viewer to use for the homology criteria. Only the sequences
are needed, no structural information is required. The choices are:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="GUI">From File</span>&mdash;Open a file browser in which
you can navigate to the desired location and select the file that contains the
sequence. If you are not using the sequences</li>
<li><span class="GUI">From Workspace</span>&mdash;Import the sequence for the
structure that is displayed in the Workspace.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">From PDB ID</span>&mdash;Import the sequence from the
specified PDB ID. Opens the <span class="GUI">Enter PDB ID</span> dialog box, in
which you can enter the PDB ID of the sequence. The sequence is retrieved from a
local copy of the PDB if it is available, or from the RCSB web site, depending
on the preference set for PDB retrieval. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Undo</span> and <span class="GUI">Redo</span>
buttons&mdash;Undo or redo the actions taken in the sequence viewer.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Find Pattern</span> text box&mdash;Find a particular
pattern in the sequence. You can use PROSITE syntax for the pattern; the syntax
is explained in the tooltip. See the <a
href="../tools_menu/multiple_sequence_viewer.html#feature2.4">Multiple Sequence
Viewer</a> topic for more information.
</p></li>
<li><p>Arrow buttons&mdash;These buttons can be used to step through instances
of the pattern, in the forward or reverse direction.
</p></li>
</ul>
</dd>

<a name="sequence_viewer"></a>
<dt>Sequence viewer</dt>
<dd><p>The sequence viewer displays the sequence of the Workspace structure and
any sequences that you import or obtain from a search for homologs. You can drag
a residue to align it and the residues downstream (to the right). Downstream
gaps are preserved. Gaps can be locked or unlocked with the toolbar buttons
below the sequence viewer, so that they are not filled when you drag to the left.
</p></dd>

<a name="alignment_toolbar"></a>
<dt>Alignment toolbar</dt>
<dd><p>This toolbar allows you to perform tasks related to sequence alignment,
which can be done manually or automatically.

<tr>
<td><img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/msv_lock.png" /></td>
<td><span class="GUI">Lock gaps</span><br />
Lock gaps in the sequences so that they are not filled when performing manual
alignment. The locking is applied once. Gaps created after locking is done are
not automatically locked. To lock them, click this button again. Locked gaps are
indicated by a dash (<code>-</code>); unlocked gaps are indicated by a tilde
(<code>~</code>). If you have a residue selection, gaps are only locked in the
selected region.
