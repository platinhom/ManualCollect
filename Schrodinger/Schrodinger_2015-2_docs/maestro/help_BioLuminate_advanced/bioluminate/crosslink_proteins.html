<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Cross-link two protein chains with a peptide linker connecting the
termini. The linker can be composed of several copies of a specified monomer
unit. A loop prediction is performed on the linker to obtain a reasonable
conformation.
</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Crosslink Proteins Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Crosslink Proteins</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Tasks &rarr; Crosslink Proteins</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
</ul>


<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Crosslink Proteins Panel</h2> 


<p>This panel allows you to cross-link two pre-positioned proteins by connecting
chain termini with peptide linkers. The link is formed with standard peptide
bonds, so the links must be formed from the N-terminus of one chain to the
C-terminus of another. </p>
<p>The linkers are composed of monomer units. You can specify the entire linker
as a monomer, you can create or read in shorter monomers and choose how many
units are in each linker, or you can choose the standard amino acids as the
monomers. If you choose to construct linkers from multiple monomer units, the
monomer units in each linker are selected randomly. The number of linkers to
construct can be specified explicitly or as a percentage of the possible
variations. You can create linkers of different lengths, by specifying the range
of numbers of monomer units in a linker. </p>
<p>The chains are connected with each linker that is generated, and the strain
energy for the linker is evaluated as the difference between the linker energy
in the linked conformation and the minimum energy of the linker in the unbound
conformation. The minimization could change the conformation of the free
linker; however it is not guaranteed to be the global minimum. 
</p>

<p>No adjustment of the relative position or orientation of the proteins is done
in the process, so you must ensure that they are properly positioned before
linking them&mdash;for example, if two proteins bind to a third and you want to
link those two proteins, you may want to take their positioning from the complex
with the third protein. 
</p>
<p>Before you can add the linkers, you must ensure that the proteins are in a
single project entry. If they are in different entries, you can create a project
entry by clicking the <span class="GUI">Workspace</span> button on the <span
class="GUI">Manager</span> toolbar to show the <span
class="GUI">Workspace</span> toolbar, then click <span class="GUI">Create
Entry</span>, and name the entry in the dialog box that opens.
</p>
<p>When you pick the termini, it can be useful to select them in the Workspace
first. To do this, you can display the sequence viewer 
(<span class="GUI">Edit &rarr; Settings &rarr; Show Sequence Viewer</span>), select the terminal
residues in the sequence viewer, then choose <span class="GUI">A &rarr;
Zoom</span> for the <span class="GUI">Selection</span> row in the <span
class="GUI">Toggle Table</span>. The residues are marked with yellow selection 
markers, which will make them easy to pick.</p>

fractions add up to 1, so you must ensure that your choices do not result in
impossible requirements (such as setting the minimum for two monomers greater
than 0.5). A warning is presented if no linkers are generated, so if you see
this warning, you should check the fractions if you have set them.

<li><span class="GUI">Simple de novo loop creation</span>&mdash;Build the loop

<p>
The strain energy is useful to score multiple possible crosslinking chains on a
relative basis. Generally, chains with lower strain energies are
better. Performing a search of multiple lengths and conformations and focusing
on those crosslinks with the lower strain energies helps to select those
candidates that are more likely to accommodate the connected domains in the
starting conformation. However, note that the strain energy is only one
component of the energy of the linked protein structure: it does not include the
interaction energy between the linker and the protein, which can compensate for
the strain.

window is open. If a job finishes while the window is open, the job remains
displayed but with the new status.  The rows are colored according to the
status: yellow for submitted, green for launched, running, or finished, red for
incorporated, died, or killed.  Click anywhere outside the window to close it.
