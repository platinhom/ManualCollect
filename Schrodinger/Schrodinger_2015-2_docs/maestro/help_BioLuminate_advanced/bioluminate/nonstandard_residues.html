<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Set up a database of nonstandard residues, by building new residues or
importing existing residues, and choose the nonstandard residues that are
shown in the residue selection tools for residue scanning.</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Non-Standard Residues Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Non-Standard Residues</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Tasks &rarr; Residue Scanning / Affinity Maturation &rarr; Manage Non-Standard Residues</span> 
in the main window.

<span class="GUI">Options</span> tab of the <span class="GUI">Residue Scanning</span> panel.</p></li>
</ul>


<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Non-Standard Residues Panel</h2> 


<p>The two tasks of this panel are to create a nonstandard residue database, and
to select nonstandard residues to show in the residue selection tools. The
database table is prepopulated with standard residues and built-in nonstandard
residues, so you can use them as templates or select them to show in the residue
selection tools.
</p>

<p><b>To create a new nonstandard residue from an existing residue:</b>
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Right-click on the residue in the <span class="GUI">Manage
Database</span> tab and choose <span class="GUI">Use as template</span>.</p>
<p>The template is placed in the sketcher, which is displayed.
</p></li>
<li><p>Use the <a href="#feature3.5">sketching tools</a> to change the structure.
</p></li>
<li><p>Enter a 3-letter residue name and a 1-letter code.</p>
<p>A valid name or code is indicated by a green check mark to the right of the box.
</p></li>
<li><p>Enter a description for your own use.
</p></li>
<li><p>Click <span class="GUI">Add to Database</span>.</p>
<p>The residue is added to the database, with a notification indicating that the
action has happened.
</p></li>
</ol>

<p><b>To build a series of nonstandard residues on a template:</b>
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Choose a template and build the first residue according to the
instructions above. 
</p></li>
<li><p>Edit the structure in the sketcher to create the next residue, and fill
in the text boxes with the new name, code, description. You can click
<span class="GUI">Reset Sketcher</span> to revert the changes you made to the
template, so you can build onto the template again. 
</p></li>
<li><p>Add the residue to the database, and repeat for as many structures as you
want to build.
</p></li>
</ol>

<p><b>To change the stereochemistry of a residue:</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Right-click on the residue in the table and choose <span class="GUI">Set
stereochemistry to</span> <i>isomer</i>. 
</p></li>
</ul>

<p><b>To edit the structure of a residue:</b>
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>If it is locked, right-click and choose <span class="GUI">Unlock</span>.
</p></li>
<li><p>Double-click the structure, or right-click and choose 
<span class="GUI">Edit structure</span>.
</p></li>
</ol>

<p><b>To select residues to appear in the residue selection tools:</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Check the box for the residue in the <span class="GUI">Mutate to</span>
column.

<a name="feature1">
<h3>Database file tools</h3>
<p>Open an existing database or create a new database. You can enter the path to
the database in the <span class="GUI">Database file</span> text box, or click
<span class="GUI">Open/Create</span> and navigate to the desired location, then
choose an existing database file or enter the name for a new database. The
database that you open is the database that is used for nonstandard residues in
residue scanning.
</p>

<a name="feature2">
<h3>Manage Database tab</h3>
<p>In this tab you can manage the nonstandard residues in the chosen database:
add new residues, provide name, code, description, select for inclusion in the
menus that show lists of nonstandard residues.
</p>

<dl>

<a name="feature2.1">
<dt><span class="GUI">Import non-standard residues from</span> option menu and button</dt>
<dd><p>Choose a source from which to import nonstandard residues. If you choose
<span class="GUI">File</span>, click the <span class="GUI">Browse</span> button
to locate the file and read in the residues. If you choose Workspace or Project
Table, the included entries or the selected entries are added to the database
when you click Import.</p>
<p>A check is done as the residues are imported to detect duplicates. If a
duplicate is found, a warning is posted, and you can choose to overwrite the
existing residue with the imported residue, assign a new name to the imported
residue by using the automatic naming scheme, or provide a new name for the
imported residue.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature2.2">
<dt>Residues table</dt>
<dd><p>This table lists three sets of residues: standard residues, built-in
nonstandard residues, and custom residues. The first set is listed so that you
can select them as templates for building new residues. The second set is listed
both for selection as templates and for marking to appear on the list of
residues to mutate to in application panels. The third set is the set that you
add to the database. Note that only the third set is actually stored in the
database; the first and second are stored in the installation and are presented
in this table for easy access. 
</p>
<p>The table has a shortcut menu with the following items:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Use as Template</span>&mdash;Use the selected row as a
template for building a new residue. When you choose this item, the residue is
added to the drawing area in the <span class="GUI">Sketch Non-Standard
Residue</span> tab, where you can modify it and add the new residue to the
database. This item is only present if a single residue row is selected. 
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Enable Mutate To</span>&mdash;Check the box in the
Mutate to column of the table for the selected residues, so that they appear on
lists in application panels. This item is not present if all the residues
selected are standard residues.
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Lock/Unlock</span>&mdash; This item is only present for
custom residues. Locking a residue makes it noneditable until it is
unlocked. The <span class="GUI">Edit Structure</span> item does not appear on
the menu for locked residues (or for standard or built-in residues).
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Edit Structure</span>&mdash;Edit the structure of the
residue. The structure is displayed in the <span class="GUI">Sketch Non-Standard
Residue</span> tab, where you can modify it and update it in the database.  This
item is only present for custom residues that are not locked.
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Set 1-letter code</span>&mdash;Set the 1-letter code
for the residue. This item is only present for custom residues that are not
locked. The 1-letter code does not have to be unique. 
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Set stereoisomer to <i>isomer</i></span>&mdash;Change the
stereoisomer from L to D or D to L. This item is only present for custom
residues that are not locked.
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Select All</span>&mdash;Select all residues in the
table. 
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Select Inverse</span>&mdash;Invert the selection of
residues in the table: the selected residues are deselected and the unselected
residues are selected.
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Export to File</span>&mdash;Export the selected
residues to a Maestro file.
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Add to Project Table</span>&mdash;Add the selected
residues to the Project Table as new project entries.
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Duplicate Rows</span>&mdash;Duplicate the selected rows
in the table. The new rows are added at the end of the table. 
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Delete Rows</span>&mdash;Delete the selected rows
from the table. This action removes these structures from the database.
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The table rows are described below.

<h3>Sketch Non-Standard Residue tab</h3>
<p>In this tab you can use the 2D sketching tools to draw new residue structures
or edit existing residue structures. You can place a template residue into the
sketcher for modification, by right-clicking on the residue in the table in
the <span class="GUI">Manage Database</span> tab and
choosing <span class="GUI">Use as template</span>.
</p>

<dl>

<a name="feature3.1">
<dt><span class="GUI">Residue name</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>Enter the 3-letter name for the residue. A name is automatically
generated for new residues. The name must be different from any other name in
the table in the <span class="GUI">Manage Database</span> tab, i.e. it must be
unique in the current nonstandard residues database. The icon to the right
indicates the status of the residue name:</p>
<ul>
<li>green check mark for a valid unique name: the residue can be added to the database</li>
<li>yellow exclamation point for valid existing name: the residue can replace
the existing residue in the database on confirmation </li>
<li>red X for an invalid name or locked existing residue: the name exists in the
database and the residue it belongs to cannot be replaced </li>
</ul>
</dd>

<a name="feature3.2">
<dt><span class="GUI">1-letter code</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>Specify the 1-letter code for the residue. The code does not have to be
unique, but it cannot be blank. A green check mark to the right indicates a
valid code.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature3.3">
<dt><span class="GUI">Description</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>Enter a description of the residue in this text box. You can add any
information you want about the residue. 
</p></dd>

<a name="feature3.4">
<dt><span class="GUI">Add to Database</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Add the residue to the database. When you click this button, the residue
is added to the table (after you resolve any issues), and the structure is
converted to 3D. The residue remains in the sketcher and this button is disabled
until you have set a new name for the residue. This allows you to make multiple
edits on the same template to produce a series of related residues, naming each
one and adding it to the database.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature3.5"></a>
<dt>Toolbar</dt>
<dd><p>The main toolbar has three sets of buttons. The first set of buttons is for
performing actions, which are described below. The second set is a collection of
rings that you can add to the structure. The third set is a collection of
elements, which you can use to change atoms to a chosen element. The selection
of the element can also be done by typing the element symbol (case insensitive).

<dt>Drawing area</dt>
<dd><p>The drawing area shows the structure and is used to build or edit
structures. You can pan the view with the right mouse button, and rotate
it with the middle mouse button. You can zoom in and out with the mouse wheel,
and you can scroll the drawing area with the scroll bars. The area is large, so
it is possible to place a number of structures in it.
</p>
<p>When the pointer is over an atom, it becomes the active atom, to which
drawing operations are applied: bonding to a new carbon atom,
changing element (by typing the element symbol), adding or replacing the
functional group (by typing a group name or SMARTS string and pressing <span
class="Keys">Enter</span>).
</p>
<p>When the pointer is over a bond and you are drawing with one of
the three bond types, the bond becomes active. You can change it to a wedge
or dashed bond, or increase the bond order, depending on the bond type.
</p>

<p>When a ring is selected, the ring is shown in blue. As you move the pointer
in the drawing area, the ring &quot;snaps&quot; to positions that show a
potential attachment of the ring to the structure.  Clicking when the ring is in
one of these positions places the ring at that position, and its color changes
to black.
</p>

<p>Right-clicking on an atom displays a shortcut menu that allows you to make
settings for that atom:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Set stereochemistry to R</span>&mdash;Set the
stereochemistry at this atom to R. This option is only available for chiral
centers. The appropriate bonds are changed to wedge or dotted to reflect the
stereochemistry. 
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Set stereochemistry to S</span>&mdash;Set the
stereochemistry at this atom to S. This option is only available for chiral
centers. The appropriate bonds are changed to wedge or dotted to reflect the
stereochemistry.
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Set allowed atoms</span>&mdash;Enter a list of atoms
that are allowed at the current center in the <span class="GUI">Edit
Atom</span> dialog box, which opens when you choose this item.
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Set as any wildcard</span>&mdash;Allow any atom to be
present at this center. The atom symbol is set to Q<i>n</i>, where <i>n</i> is a
numerical suffix to distinguish different &quot;wildcard&quot; atoms. A text
label is also placed in the Workspace reading &quot;Q<i>n</i> = Any atom&quot;.
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Set as any wildcard</span>&mdash;Allow any atom to be

<li><p><span class="GUI">Add unpaired electron</span>&mdash;Mark the atom as a
radical, and place a dot next to the atom.
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Set R group</span>&mdash;Mark the atom as an R group.
The submenu has items for <span class="GUI">R1</span> through 
<span class="GUI">R6</span>, and an <span class="GUI">Rn</span> item to set the
index if needed to a value greater than 6. You can label more than one center
with the same R group label.
