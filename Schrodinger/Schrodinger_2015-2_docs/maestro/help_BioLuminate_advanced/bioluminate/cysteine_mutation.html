<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>This panel allows you to find residues that can be mutated to Cys and form
disulfide bonds, and to mutate Cys to other residues to break disulfide bonds.
</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Cysteine Mutation Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Cysteine Mutation</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Tasks &rarr; Cysteine Mutation</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
</ul>


<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Cysteine Mutation Panel</h2> 


<p>The basic workflow for using this panel is as follows:
</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Display the protein you want to analyze in the Workspace. You should
ensure that it is properly prepared (with the 
<a href="../workflows/protein_preparation.html"><span class="GUI">Protein
Preparation Wizard</span></a>).
</p></li>
<li><p>If you want to analyze only part of the protein, select the residues that
you want to analyze, and select <span class="GUI">Analyze only selected
Workspace residues</span>.
</p></li>
<li><p>Click <span class="GUI">Analyze Workspace</span> or <span
class="GUI">Analyze MD Trajectory</span></p>
<p>When the analysis finishes, the <span class="GUI">Residue pairs for
mutation</span> table is populated with the residue pairs that were found.
</p></li>
<li><p>Filter the list to show only the mutations you are interested in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the display options to display the mutation types that you are
intereseted in.
</li>
<li>Use the menus below the table to select the residues that you want to
mutate to or from. The table is updated to show only those residues. 
</li>
<li>Use the cutoffs to filter out pairs that do not meet specified criteria.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Select the pairs that you want to mutate. Each pair is mutated
independently to produce a structure and an energy evaluation. 
</p></li>
<li><p>Decide whether you want to optimize residues near to the mutated residues
by selecting from the <span class="GUI">Minimization shell</span>
options, and choose a minimization method. The mutated residues are always
optimized.  
</p></li>
<li><p>Click the <span class="GUI">Settings</span> button,</p>
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/settings.png" />
<p>set the job parameters in the <span class="GUI">Job Settings</span> dialog
box, and click <span class="GUI">Run</span> to run the job; or 
click <span class="GUI">Run</span> to run the job with the current job settings.
</p></li> 
<li><p>When the job finishes, go to the <span class="GUI">Results</span> tab. If
the results are not listed in the <span class="GUI">Mutations</span> table,
click <span class="GUI">Load Results from Previous Run</span>, navigate to and
open the output Maestro file from the job.
</p></li>
<li><p>Click a row in the <span class="GUI">Mutations</span> table to show the
mutated residues in the Workspace, rendered in ball-and-stick. If you want to
see the original residues as well, select <span class="GUI">Display original
structure in gray</span>. 
</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The output structures are included in the project, so you can use them for
other purposes. Depending on how many residues you included in the optimization
around the mutated pair, you might want to minimize the structure with fewer
constraints before using it in another application.

specify the interval at which the analysis is performed on the trajectory, as 
a number of steps. The analysis takes some time, and is run under job control.
