<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>This panel allows you to set up and run a job to dock peptides to a protein
using Glide. The protein is treated as a rigid structure, but with some
softening of the potentials for flexibility; the peptides are treated as
flexible structures.
</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Peptide Docking Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Peptide Docking</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Tasks &rarr; Peptide Docking</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
</ul>


<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Peptide Docking Panel</h2> 


<p>Peptide docking is done with Glide, which treats the receptor as a rigid
structure but with softening of the potentials in the active site region to
simulate small adjustments of the receptor to the ligand. The peptide ligands
are treated flexibly. As peptides are very flexible compared to more typical
non-peptide ligands, the Glide docking is performed with increased sampling, and
several docking runs are done for each peptide, with different input
conformations, to further increase the sampling.
</p>

<p>With the Glide technology, peptides that have a diameter greater than
80&nbsp;&Aring; cannot be docked due to the grid box size limit. This
corresponds to a linear peptide of about 16 residues. Glide also restricts the
number of rotatable bonds to 100, due to the rapid increase in the number of
conformations with the number of rotatable bonds. The maximum peptide length
that can be docked in practice will depend on the conformation and the residue
types.
</p>

<p>Docking peptides is time consuming as there are many conformations to
explore. A single peptide can take a few hours to dock. It it recommended that
you run the job across multiple processors if you can, especially if you want to
dock several peptides.

<dl>

<a name="feature1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Define protein receptor region</span> section</dt>
<dd><p>In this section, you define the binding site for the peptides on the
protein. The grids that are generated for the docking are centered on the
location that you choose for the binding site. 
</p>

<dl>

<dt><span class="GUI">Centroid of Workspace ligand</span> option and <span class="GUI">Pick</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Center the binding site and thus the docking grids at the centroid of the
ligand molecule that you pick in the Workspace. Use this option if your receptor
has a ligand that occupies the binding site. To pick the ligand molecule,
select <span class="GUI">Pick</span> and click on a ligand atom in the
Workspace. Information on the ligand is shown in the box once you have picked
the ligand.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Centroid of selected residues</span> option and <span class="GUI">Select Residues</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Set the center of the binding site at the centroid of a set of residues
that you select. This option is useful if you don't have a bound ligand. You
should choose residues whose centroid is approximately where the centroid of a
bound ligand should be.</p>
<p>To select the residues:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <span class="GUI">Select Residues</span>.</li>
<li>Click the <span class="GUI">Residues</span> tab.</li>
<li>Pick the residues in the Workspace.</li>
<li>Click <span class="GUI">Add</span>, then click <span class="GUI">OK</span>.</li>
</ol>
</dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">X</span>, <span class="GUI">Y</span>, <span class="GUI">Z</span>, text boxes</dt>
<dd><p>These noneditable text boxes show the coordinates of the center of the
binding site.
</p></dd>

</dl>

<p>The maximum number of residues in any peptide that will be docked is reported
below the coordinates of the active site center. This value is used for Glide
grid generation, to define the size of the grids. The maximum possible linear
peptide length is 16 residues, but it is likely that such peptides could have
too many rotatable bonds to be docked with Glide. The limit on the number of
rotatable bonds is 100.
</p></dd>

<a name="box"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Peptide docking box dimensions</span> section</dt>
<dd><p>Define the box in which the peptide ligands can be placed during docking
(the <i>outer box</i> or <i>grid box</i>). There are two options:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><span class="GUI">Set automatically based on peptide ligand set</span></dt>
<dd><p>Select this option if you want the box size to be determined
automatically once the peptide ligand set is defined. This option ensures that
the box size is no larger than is necessary, and is the default.
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Outer box fully accommodates linear peptide of <i>N</i>
residues</span></dt>
<dd><p>Specify the maximum number of residues in the peptides that you want to 
dock. This option sets the box size so that it accommodates the longest peptide
in a linear conformation. The box may be larger than necessary to dock the
actual conformations. 
</p></dd>
</dl>

</dd>

<a name="feature2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Define peptides to dock</span> section</dt>
<dd><p>In this section you choose the peptides to dock, which can be taken from
the Project Table or a file, or can be entered by hand.
</p>

<dl>

<dt><span class="GUI">Add sequences from</span> buttons</dt>
<dd><p>To add peptides to the list, click one of the buttons. You can click any
of the buttons multiple times, to add peptides to the list.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="GUI">File</span>&mdash;Add peptide sequences from a
file. Opens a file selector in which you can locate and open the file.
The file must be a plain text file (<code>.txt</code>) with one sequence per
line, or a PDB file (<code>.pdb</code>) with a single structure. </li>
<li><span class="GUI">Project Table</span>&mdash;Use the peptide
sequences from the selected entries in the Project Table. You should select the
entries in the Project Table first. Only the sequences are used: the structures
are generated as part of the process.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Text</span>&mdash;Enter the sequence of the peptide to be
docked as a string of one-letter standard residue codes. Opens a dialog box in
which you can type in the sequence.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt>Peptide list</dt>
<dd><p>The peptides to be docked are listed in this area. You can select
multiple rows to remove them. You can edit individual rows by double-clicking on
the row, then editing the text. If the sequence is colored red, it contains an
invalid single-letter residue code, and must be corrected.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Delete</span> and <span class="GUI">Delete All</span>
buttons</dt>
<dd><p>Remove the selected peptides or all peptides from the list.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Export</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Export the sequences from the peptide list to a plain text file, one
sequence per line.
</p></dd>

</dl>

</dd>

<a name="feature3"></a>
<dt>Docking options and settings</dt>
<dd><p>
</p>Set options for conformer generation, docking runs and results.

<dl>

<dt><span class="GUI">When generating conformers from sequences</span> options</dt>
<dd><p>Select options for the types of conformers that can be generated from the
sequences.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="GUI">Neutralize termini</span>&mdash;Neutralize the terminal
acid and amine groups, rather than allowing them to be charged (zwitterionic). 
Capping groups (NMA and ACE) are not added to the termini. <p>
</p>
This option is turned off and cannot be changed in the current release, so the
termini are charged.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Allow cis amide bonds</span>&mdash;Allow peptide linkages
in the cis conformation rather than the usual trans conformation.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Number of independent docking runs per peptide</span> box</dt>
<dd><p>Specify the number of indpendent docking runs to perform for each
peptide. Each docking run for a given peptide uses a different input
conformation, which helps to increase the sampling of conformations in the
docking process, and thus produce a better set of poses for the peptide.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Number of poses to return for each independent docking run</span> box</dt>
<dd><p>Specify the number of poses to return from each independent docking
run. The poses from each run are combined and sorted to give a set of poses
for the peptide. If the number specified is too small, you risk losing good
poses. For example, if the first ten poses from a particular run are lower than
any of the poses from the other runs, and you only allow one pose from each run,
you would lose nine of the best poses.
</p></dd>

</dl>

</dd>

<a name="feature4"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Scoring method</span> options</dt>
<dd><p>Set options for scoring the docked poses. 
</p>

<dl>

<dt><span class="GUI">MM-GBSA</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Use the MM-GBSA ligand binding energy as the score. This option involves
an extra calculation to evaluate the binding free energy in implicit solvent. 
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Glidescore</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Use the GlideScore value from the docking run to score the peptide poses.
</p></dd>

stops when there are no more jobs running. If a job fails to start, it changes
to an exclamation point. 
</p>
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/job_status.png" />
<p>
Clicking the button shows a small job status window that lists the job name and
status for all active jobs submitted from the current panel (for Jaguar and
MacroModel this means all jobs from any of the application panels). You can
double-click on a row to open the <a href="../misc/monitor_panel.html"><span
class="GUI">Monitor</span> panel</a> and monitor the job, or click the <span
