<h3>Import button</h3>
<p>To import a perturbation map from a file, click this button. A file selector
opens, in which you can navigate to and open the FEP map file
(<code>out.pkl</code>).</p>

<p>You can import more than one map at a time, by selecting multiple files in
the file selector, or by clicking <span class="GUI">Import</span> for each map.
The results from each imported map are merged into a single graph. There must be
common ligands so that the map can be merged into a single map. If this is not
the case, an error message is displayed and the import is canceled.</p>

<p>If you want to examine a new map rather than merging maps,
click <span class="GUI">Reset</span> first, then import the new map.
</p>

<a name="feature2"></a>
<h3>Results tab</h3>
<p>This tab displays the results for the binding free energies of the ligands.
It has a single table, whose columns are described below.
</p>

<table cellpadding=5>
<tr>
<td style="padding-right: 10px;"><span class="GUI">Ligand</span></td>
<td>Title of the ligand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="padding-right: 10px;"><span class="GUI">Experimental &Delta;G
(kcal/mol)</span></td> 
<td>Experimental binding free energy. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="padding-right: 10px;"><span class="GUI">Predicted &Delta;G
(kcal/mol)</span></td>
<td>Final predicted &Delta;G for a set of ligands. This prediction requires the
experimental binding free energy for at least one of the ligands, which is used
as the reference. If the experimental binding free energies for multiple ligands
are available, then all these ligands are used as the reference to convert the
relative &Delta;G to the final predicted &Delta;G, forcing the average of the
predicted dGs and average of the experimental dGs to be equal among the ligands
with experimental binding free energies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="padding-right: 10px;"><span class="GUI">Predicted Error
(kcal/mol)</span></td> 
<td>Minimum error along all paths from the reference ligand to the ligand.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<a name="feature3"></a>
<h3>Hysteresis tab</h3>
<p>This tab reports hysteresis values around various cycles (closed paths in the
graph).
</p>

<table cellpadding=5>
<tr>
<td style="padding-right: 10px;"><span class="GUI">Hysteresis</span></td>
<td>Value of the hysteresis around a cycle. The value is colored according how
well it has converged: green is good, yellow is acceptable, red is poor. The
thresholds depend on the length N of the loop: 0.5&#8730;N for good,
0.5&#8730;N for poor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="padding-right: 10px;"><span class="GUI">Cycle</span></td>
<td>Information on the cycle for which the hysteresis was evaluated.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<a name="feature4"></a>
<h3>Raw Data tab</h3>
<p>This tab presents the &Delta;&Delta;G values and errors estimated from the
raw results of the individual perturbation calculations. 
</p>

<table cellpadding=5>
<tr>
<td style="padding-right: 10px;"><span class="GUI">Ligand1</span></td>
<td>Title of the first ligand in a perturbation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="padding-right: 10px;"><span class="GUI">Ligand2</span></td>
<td>Title of the second ligand in a perturbation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="padding-right: 10px;"><span class="GUI">Experimental &Delta;&Delta;G 
(kcal/mol)</span></td>
<td>Experimental relative binding free energy difference for the two
ligands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="padding-right: 10px;"><span class="GUI">Bennett &Delta;&Delta;G 
(kcal/mol)</span></td>
<td>Free energy difference between two ligands directly connected in an
FEP_mapper graph, estimated with the Bennett Acceptance Ratio method. This
estimate relies only on data for the two ligands, and not on any other
perturbation in the graph. </td>  
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="padding-right: 10px;"><span class="GUI">Bennett Error
(kcal/mol)</span></td>
<td>Analytical statistical uncertainty estimate for the calculated Bennett
&Delta;&Delta;G between a pair of ligands that are directly connected in an FEP
mapper graph. The esitmate is calculated based on the assumption that all the
important regions of the phase space have been sample, and usually it estimates
the real error in the predicted free energy.  This estimate relies only on data
for the perturbation of the two ligands, and not on any other perturbation in
the graph.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="padding-right: 10px;"><span class="GUI">Cycle Closure Corrected
&Delta;&Delta;G (kcal/mol)</span></td>
<td>Cycle closure prediction of the free energy difference between two
ligands. The cycle closure algorithm takes the Bennett &Delta;&Delta;G of all
the pairs of ligands connected in the graph as input, and calculates the
statistically most proper values of &Delta;&Delta;G using the maximal likelihood
method. The bennett_ddG results may have hysteresis, while the Cycle Closure
Corrected &Delta;&Delta;G results do not have hysteresis, i.e. the free energy
difference between any pair of ligands is independent of the path.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="padding-right: 10px;"><span class="GUI">Cycle Closure Corrected
Error (kcal/mol)</span></td>
<td>Estimate of the error in the cycle closure prediction of the free energy
difference. The error is calculated from the Bennett &Delta;&Delta;G for all the
pairs of ligands connected in the graph, and it is related to the hysteresis of
the Bennett &Delta;&Delta;G of the closed thermodynamic cycle.</td>
</tr>

<h3>Export button</h3>
<p>This button has a menu that allows you to export the map to a file, export an
image of the map to a PDF file, or export the table data to a CSV file or an
Excel spreadsheet.
</p>

<a name="reset"></a>
<h3>Reset button</h3>
<p>Clear all data from the panel and reset it to its default state. Use this
button if you want to replace the existing map with another map, rather than
merge the results.
</p>

<a name="feature7"></a>
<h3>Display Edge &Delta;&Delta;G button</h3>
<p>This button has a menu from which you can choose to display the
&Delta;&Delta;G values on the edges of the graph: the raw (Bennet) predicted
values, the (cycle closure) corrected predictions, and the experimental
values. The values are color-coded, with the experiment in black, the raw
predictions in blue and the corrected predictions in red.
</p>

<a name="feature6"></a>
<h3>Map display area</h3>
<p>This area displays the perturbation graph.</p>
<p>You can drag the ligands to reposition them on the graph.</p>

<p>You can zoom in or out with the scroll wheel or use the + and - buttons at
the top left of the display area. When zoomed out, the ligands are represented
by a number in a box. As you zoom in, the number is replaced by the 2d structure
when the resolution is high enough to display it.  Double-clicking on a
connection zooms in to that connection.</p>

<p>When you pause the pointer over a ligand, the parts of the graph to which it
is not connected are dimmed. When zoomed out, the 2D structures are also
displayed in a tooltip.
</p>
<p>Right-clicking on a connection displays a menu, with two items, 
<span class="GUI">Delete connection</span> and <span class="GUI">Explore
connection</span>. The latter displays a panel at the bottom of the display area
that contains the 2D structures for the connection, with tools for annotating
the structures:
<ul>
<li><span class="GUI">Mutation</span>&mdash;highlight the
mutation. The mutated atoms are marked with red circles and the changed bonds
are colored red.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Atom mapping</span>&mdash;Show the atom numbering on
the structures.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Common core</span>&mdash;Mark the common core with
green bonds.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">None</span>&mdash;Show the structures without any
annotation.</li>
</ul>
