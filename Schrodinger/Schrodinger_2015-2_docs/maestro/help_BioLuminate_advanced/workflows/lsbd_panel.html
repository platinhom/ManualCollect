<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
This panel is used to generate ligand and structure-based descriptors for a
structure-based QSAR model of ligand binding to a receptor. These descriptors
can be used as input to the model-generation facility in Strike.
</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Ligand and Structure-Based Descriptors Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Ligand and Structure-Based Descriptors</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Tasks &rarr; Small Molecule Tasks &rarr; Ligand and Structure-Based Descriptors</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
</ul>


<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Ligand and Structure-Based Descriptors Panel</h2> 


<p>
This panel provides a convenient interface to several Schr&ouml;dinger programs,
which are used to generate descriptors for a QSAR model. The focus is on
generating descriptors for a set of ligands that are docked to a receptor.
Three of the programs, Liaison, Prime MM-GBSA, and the Embrace module of
MacroModel, operate on the ligand and the receptor. The other two, QikProp and
Ligparse, operate on the ligand only. The descriptors extracted from Liaison,
Prime MM-GBSA, and Embrace are energetic properties related to ligand
binding. QikProp generates ADME properties, and LigParse generates
structure-based properties such as functional group counts.
</p>

<p>To set up a calculation, you must select a receptor and a source of ligands.
The receptor and ligands can come from a pose viewer file, or from separate
files, or from the current project. The selections are made in the <span
class="GUI">Source of Ligands and Receptor</span> section.
</p>

<p>After choosing a receptor and ligands, you can choose the descriptors you
want to generate. For each of the five programs, there is an option in the
<span class="GUI">Select descriptors to generate</span> section of the
panel. The programs are run with default options that were chosen to produce
reasonable descriptors. If you want to change any of these options or change
some of the job options, click the <span class="GUI">Advanced Options</span>
button, and make your choices in the <span class="GUI">Ligand and
Structure-Based Descriptors - Advanced Options</span> dialog box.
The settings available in this dialog box are a limited set of the full range of
settings, designed to provide useful descriptors for a QSAR model. </p>

<p>If you want to clear all custom settings and return to the default settings,
click <span class="GUI">Reset</span> in the <span class="GUI">Ligand and
Structure-Based Descriptors</span> panel. The settings for all programs are
returned to their defaults.</p>

<p>When you have made all your selections, you can click <span
class="GUI">Run</span> to run the job with the current settings, choose
<span class="GUI">Job Settings</span> from the <span class="GUI">Settings</span>
button menu to make job settings, or choose <span class="GUI">Write</span> to
write the input files without running the jobs.  When you choose <span
class="GUI">Write</span>, the settings that you made are saved, and can be
retrieved by choosing <span class="GUI">Read</span>. The input files are
written, the directories set up for each kind of job, and the jobs are
started.</p>
<p>
The main master job and the master jobs for each program run on the local host,
even if you selected a different host to run the calculations on. Jobs for
different programs are run concurrently if the host selection and number of
processors allows it (for example, if the host is a queue). Jobs for individual
programs can be distributed over multiple processors if the program allows
it. Settings for distributing individual programs can be made in the <span
class="GUI">Advanced Options</span> panel: these settings override those made in
the <span class="GUI">Job Settings</span> dialog box. There is one restriction on host
selection: the launch directory (current working directory) must be mounted on
all hosts to which jobs are submitted.
</p>

<p>The results are collected as a set of descriptors in a <tt>.csv</tt> file,
and the properties are merged with the input ligand structures in the output
file, <i>jobname</i><code>-out.mae</code>. The output from the Prime MM-GBSA,
Liaison, and Embrace calculations is also returned, in
.<i>jobname</i><code>-</code><i>product</i><code>-out.mae</code>.
If you chose entries from the Project Table, the descriptors are imported into
the project when the calculations finish. </p>

<a name="job_toolbar"></a>
<h3>Job toolbar</h3>
<p>The Job toolbar is used to make settings for a job and to start it. </p>

<dl>
<dt><span class="GUI">Job name</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>Enter a name for the job in this text box.
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Settings</span> button menu</dt>
<dd><p>This button opens the <a href="../misc/job_settings.html"><span
class="GUI">Job Settings</span> dialog box</a>. The arrow to the right opens
a menu, from which you can make settings or perform actions that are related to
the job. </p>
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/settings.png" />
<p>The menu items are described below.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="GUI">Job Settings</span>&mdash;Make and save settings for the
incorporation of the job into the Maestro project, the job name, the host,
the distribution of subjobs, and any other application-specific job settings.
Opens the <span class="GUI">Job Settings</span> dialog box.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Preferences</span>&mdash;Set general preferences for
running jobs. Opens the <span class="GUI">Preferences</span> panel at the <a
href="../maestro_menu/preferences.html#jobs_starting"><span class="GUI">Jobs - 
Starting</span> section</a>.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Read</span>&mdash;Read an inputfile and apply the settings in the file to the panel controls.
Opens a file selector in which you can navigate to the desired input file.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Write</span>&mdash;Write the input files for the job but do not start it. 
The file names are based on the current job name, and the files are written to
a subdirectory of the current working directory that is named with the job
name.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Reset Panel</span>&mdash;Reset the values in the panel to 
their defaults.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Job status</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>This icon indicates when there are jobs running for the application that
belong to the current project. It starts spinning when the first job starts, and
stops when there are no more jobs running. If a job fails to start, it changes
to an exclamation point. 
</p>
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/job_status.png" />
<p>
Clicking the button shows a small job status window that lists the job name and
status for all active jobs submitted from the current panel (for Jaguar and
MacroModel this means all jobs from any of the application panels). You can
double-click on a row to open the <a href="../misc/monitor_panel.html"><span
class="GUI">Monitor</span> panel</a> and monitor the job, or click the <span
class="GUI">Monitor</span> button to open the <span class="GUI">Monitor</span>
panel and close the job status window. The job status is updated while the
window is open. If a job finishes while the window is open, the job remains
displayed but with the new status.  The rows are colored according to the
status: yellow for submitted, green for launched, running, or finished, red for
incorporated, died, or killed.  Click anywhere outside the window to close it.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Run</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Run the job with the current job settings.
</p></dd>
</dl>


<a name="status_bar"></a>
<h3>Status bar</h3>
<p>The status bar displays information about the current job settings for the
panel. This includes the job name, task name and task settings (if any), number
of subjobs (if any) and the host name and job incorporation setting. It also
displays a message for a short time when you start a new job.</p>
<p>The status bar also contains the <span class="GUI">Help</span> button, which
opens the help topic for the panel.</p>
