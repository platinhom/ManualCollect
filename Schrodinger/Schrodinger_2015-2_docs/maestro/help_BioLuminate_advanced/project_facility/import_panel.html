<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>The <span class="GUI">Import</span> panel allows you to import structures and
their properties into the current project from Maestro files and a wide variety
of other file formats, including PDB, MDL SD, and Sybyl Mol2 formats, files
containing a list of SMILES strings, MacroModel and Jaguar input and output
files, MCPRO input files, Desmond CMS files; and from many other file
formats supported by the OpenBabel file conversion utility. If you are importing
structures from Maestro files, you can also import various settings. When the
structures are imported, you can control which structures, if any, are displayed
in the Workspace. You can import structures from multiple files at the same
time. Multiple structures from any single file can be added as an entry group to
the Project Table, with the group named after the file.</p>

</ul>


<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Import Dialog Box</h2> 


<p>To import structures from one or more files, you can either enter the file
names directly into the <span class="GUI">File name</span> text box or use the
<span class="GUI">Look in</span> tools to navigate to and select files.</p>

<p>Maestro opens and reads the files using the current settings, which are set in
the <span class="GUI">Options</span> section of the panel. To display this
section, click <span class="GUI">Options</span>.  Maestro accepts both absolute
(e.g. <tt>/home/joe/file1.dat</tt>) and relative (e.g. <tt>file1.dat</tt>) file
names.</p>

<p>Maestro adds two properties to the structures on import: the full path to the
file from which the structures were imported (<span class="GUI">Source
Path</span>), and the file name without the path <span class="GUI">(Source
File</span>). If these properties already exist in the imported structures, they
are overwritten.
</p>

<p>You can drag and drop Maestro, SD, PDB, XYZ, and MOL2 files from your window
manager's file explorer onto the Workspace to import the structures in the
file. When you do so, the first structure in the first file is added to the
Workspace (rather than replacing it) and the new entries are added to the entry
selection in the Project Table. </p>

<p>On Windows, you can double-click on Maestro, SD, PDB, and MOL2 files to
import them into the most recent Maestro session, or a new session if Maestro is
not running.
</p>

<p>If the structures you want to import are in another project, you can import
them by choosing <span class="GUI">File &rarr; Advanced File Options &rarr; Import from Project</span>. A
project selector opens, so you can select the project, and then a dialog box
opens that lists the entries in the project, displaying the title and the PDB ID.
</p>

<p>If you want to import structures from a file that you have recently imported
from, you can choose <span class="GUI">File &rarr; Import Recent Structures</span> &rarr; <i>filename</i>. 
The file is imported with the current import settings. This is especially useful
when importing into a different project, as the list records all recent imports
in any Maestro session or project.
The number of files displayed on the list can be set in the  
<a href="../maestro_menu/preferences.html#general_history"><span
class="GUI">General &ndash; History</span> tab</a> of the <span
class="GUI">Preferences</span> panel.  
</p>

<p>You can import structures by entering a text command in the <span
class="GUI">Command Input Area</span> in the main window. To import structures
from a file, enter:</p>
<p><tt>entryimport </tt><i>filename</i> </p>
<p>including any appropriate option or path name.</p>

<h2>Import Dialog Box Features</h2> 


<p>The <span class="GUI">Import</span> panel has the standard file selection
tools that usually appear in <a href="../misc/fileselector.html">File
Selectors</a>, including a custom file filter. Options for display, 
structure selection, grouping of structures, and so on, are hidden by default,
but can be displayed by clicking <span class="GUI">Options</span>. The options
are described below. Other settings for import are available in the 
<a href="../maestro_menu/preferences.html#project_import"><span
class="GUI">Preferences</span> panel</a>.
</p>  

<ul>
<li><a href="#section4.1"><span class="GUI">Import all structures</span>
option and range controls</a></li>

</ul>

<dl>

<a name="section4.1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Import all structures</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Select this option to import all structures from the specified
file. Deselect this option to specify the structures to import. To specify
the structures, enter the starting index in the <span class="GUI">Start</span>
text box, and either select <span class="GUI">End</span> to import to the end of
file, or deselect <span class="GUI">End</span> and enter the number of
structures to import in the <span class="GUI">Total</span> text box.</p>

<p>The start index is automatically reset to 1 when a different file is
selected. These capabilities only apply to file formats that allow multiple
structures, and not, for example, to PDB files.
</p></dd>

<a name="section4.6"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Import associated data files</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>If the structure file has other data associated with it, such as volume
data for surfaces, the data can be imported into the project and associated with
the relevant entries, by selecting this option. The mapping of the data to the
entries is done in a file with the suffix <code>.smap</code>. This option is
selected by default.
</p></dd>

<a name="section4.2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Replace Workspace</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Select this option to clear the Workspace before opening the new file,
and display in the Workspace the structures specified with the <span
class="GUI">Include in Workspace</span> option menu.  If this option is not
selected, the new structures are added to the current project and the Workspace
remains as it is.
</p></dd>

<a name="section4.3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">For Maestro files, modify property mapping</span>
option</dt>
<dd><p>Modify the mapping of properties in the imported file to the properties
in the project. This allows resolution of property types as well as creation of
a single project property from multiple sources. The <a
href="map_properties.html"><span class="GUI">Map Properties</span> dialog
box</a> opens when you click <span class="GUI">Open</span>. 
</p></dd>

<a name="section4.9"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">For Desmond files, import only first structure</span>
option</dt>
<dd><p>When importing from a <span class="GUI">.cms</span> file, import only the
first structure. There is no need in this case to use the 
<span class="GUI">Start</span> and <span class="GUI">Total</span> text boxes.
</p></dd>

<a name="section4.7"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">For PDB files, read alternate locations</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Select this option to read alternate locations from a PDB file. If
deselected, the coordinates for the atoms with the highest occupancy are read,
and the rest are ignored. You can display alternate locations from the <span
class="GUI">Workspace</span> menu.
</p></dd>

<a name="section4.8"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">For SD files, create titles from</span> options</dt>
<dd><p>Specify the property to be used as the title in Maestro:
</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="GUI">SD molecule name</span>&mdash;This is the default, and
corresponds to the first row in the CT block. </li>
<li><span class="GUI">SD property</span>&mdash;Select this option to use a
specified property for the title, and enter the property name in the text box. </li>
</ul>
</dd>

<a name="section4.5"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Create groups for</span> option menu</dt>
<dd><p>When you import structures, they can be added to the Project Table as
entry groups. This option menu allows you to create a group for each file with
multiple structures (the default) or for all files, to create a single group for
all files, or to import structures without placing them in an entry group (<span
class="GUI">None</span> option). This choice applies whether you are importing
from a single file or from multiple files. If you choose to create a single group
for all imported files, you can provide a name in the <span class="GUI">Group
name</span> text box.
</p></dd>

</dl>

<a name="progress"></a>
<h2>Import Progress and Reporting</h2>

<p>If the import takes more than a few seconds, or there are errors on import,
the <span class="GUI">Import Progress</span> dialog box opens. The dialog box
shows which file is being read and how many structures have been read. It also
shows whether there have been any errors or warnings on import, and shows the
related messages in a text area. You can show or hide these messages by clicking
the <span class="GUI">Details</span> button. You can also copy and paste the
messages into another application with the usual key strokes.</p>
<p>You can suspend import by clicking the <span class="GUI">Pause</span> button.
This allows you to examine any messages that were generated, and choose whether
to continue with the import or cancel it. The button changes to <span
class="GUI">Resume</span>, so you can continue the import. </p>
<p>If you cancel the import, the structures imported successfully are kept. If
you want to delete these structures, click the <span class="GUI">Undo</span>
button, or choose <span class="GUI">Edit &rarr; Undo</span> in the main window.
</p>
<p>When the import finishes, the dialog box remains open if there were any
errors or warnings, or if the messages area is displayed. The <span
class="GUI">Cancel</span> button changes to <span class="GUI">OK</span> so that
you can dismiss the dialog box when you have finished examining the messages.
</p>

<h2>Importing Compressed Files</h2>

<p>Maestro can read compressed Maestro, SD, PDB, and SMILES files in gzip
format, and uncompress them while reading. It recognizes these files
automatically by the extension <code>.maegz</code> or <code>.mae.gz</code> for
Maestro files, <code>.sdfgz</code> or <code>.sdf.gz</code> for SD files,
<code>.pdb.gz</code> for PDB files, and
<code>.smigz</code> or <code>.smi.gz</code> for SMILES files. To read
compressed files in other formats, you must uncompress them first, for example
using <code>gunzip</code> on Linux, or one of the zip applications on
Windows. If the compressed files do not have the appropriate extensions, rename
them to include the proper extensions. This renaming step may be necessary
particularly when downloading PDB files from internet sites.</p>
