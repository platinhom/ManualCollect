<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>The Glide <span class="GUI">Ligand Docking</span> panel is used to set up and
run docking jobs using previously calculated receptor grids. To generate
receptor grids, see the <a href="receptor_grid_generation.html">Receptor Grid
Generation Panel</a> topic.</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Ligand Docking Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Ligand Docking</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Applications &rarr; Glide &rarr; Ligand Docking</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Tasks &rarr; Small Molecule Tasks &rarr; Docking &rarr; Ligand Docking</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
</ul>


<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Ligand Docking Panel</h2> 


<p>Glide ligand docking jobs require a set of previously calculated receptor
grids and one or more ligand structures. Preparation of the ligands before
docking is strongly recommended. LigPrep or MacroModel can be used to prepare
ligands. If a correct Lewis structure cannot be generated for a ligand, it will
be skipped by the docking job.</p>

<p>When you have chosen settings for the options in the tabs, you can choose
<span class="GUI">Job Settings</span> from the <span class="GUI">Settings</span>
button in the lower left corner of the panel.</p>
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/settings.png" />
<p>
This opens the <span class="GUI">Ligand Docking - Job Settings</span> dialog
box.  Along with the standard controls, this dialog box includes controls for
distributed processing: options and text boxes for specifying the number of
subjobs or the maximum number of ligands per subjob, and a table of hosts, in
which you can select hosts and specify the number of processors to use on
each. For details, see the <a href="../misc/job_settings.html">Job Settings
Dialog Box</a> topic. The number of subjobs cannot be set to fewer than the
number of processors: if you specify more processors, the number of subjobs is
adjusted upward to match. The ligands are divided evenly between the subjobs
when the job is run.</p>

<p>You can also incorporate the docking results into the project by
choosing from the <span class="GUI">Incorporate</span> option menu; however,
incorporating a large number of ligands can take a long time. </p>

<p>Default values are used for all other command-line options. For example, the
range of ligands that is divided into subjobs is the entire range of ligands to
dock as specified in the <span class="GUI">Range</span> text boxes in the <span
class="GUI">Ligands</span> tab.  If you are using the default range (dock all
ligands in the file), <tt>glide</tt> creates <i>j</i> subjobs starting with the
first ligand in the file and ending with the last. If you have specified
multiple files, all ligands in all files are distributed among the subjobs. To
use different settings for this and other options, run <tt>glide</tt> from the
command line, as described in the <a href="../../../glide/glide_user_manual.pdf"
target="pdfmanuals"><i>Glide User Manual</i></a>.
</p>

<p>If the grid files are not available on the host from which you submit the
job, the job will not be submitted, as a check is done to confirm the
availability of the grid. If you want to submit a job with a grid that is not
available on the local host, you can do so from the command line.
</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can choose <span class="GUI">Write</span> from the <span
class="GUI">Settings</span> button menu to write the input files without
starting the job. In addition to the input file, a shell script is written that
you can use to run the job. The script is written with the current settings
from the <span class="GUI">Job Settings</span> dialog box. The files are
written to a subdirectory in the current directory. Both the subdirectory and
the files are named using the job name.</p>

<p>To restore the default settings in all tabs, choose <span class="GUI">Reset
Panel</span> from the <span class="GUI">Settings</span> button menu.</p>

<h2>Ligand Docking Panel Features</h2> 


<p>The main part of the <span class="GUI">Ligand Docking</span> panel
contains several tabs, which are described in separate topics, linked
below. The remaining features are described in this topic.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#feature1"><span class="GUI">Receptor grid</span> text box and <span class="GUI">Browse</span> button</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature2"><span class="GUI">Display receptor</span> option</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature3"><span class="GUI">Show grid boxes</span> option</a></li>
<li><a href="dock_ligands.html"><span class="GUI">Ligands</span> tab</a></li>
<li><a href="dock_settings.html"><span class="GUI">Settings</span> tab</a></li>
<li><a href="dock_core.html"><span class="GUI">Core</span> tab</a></li>
<li><a href="dock_constraints.html"><span class="GUI">Constraints</span> tab</a></li>

</ul>

<dl>
<a name="feature1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Receptor grid</span> text box and <span class="GUI">Browse</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Click <span class="GUI">Browse</span> to open a file selector and choose
a grid for your docking job to use. The grid files are stored in compressed
form, in a <code>.zip</code> file. The file name is displayed in
the <span class="GUI">Receptor grid</span> text box. You can also enter the 
file name directly into the text box. The grid file must be accessible to the
host on which you are running Maestro.</p> 
<p>If you plan to use <span class="GUI">SP-Peptide</span> docking, you must
select a grid that was generated for this docking mode
(with <span class="GUI">Generate grid suitable for peptide docking</span>
selected in the <span class="GUI">Receptor</span> tab of
the <span class="GUI">Receptor Grid Generation</span> panel). If you plan to use
any of the other three docking modes, you must not select a grid generated
for <span class="GUI">SP-Peptide</span> docking.
</p>
<p>If you want to use grids from earlier releases in which the grid was not
compressed, you can also choose the <tt>.grd</tt> file for the grid to use that
grid.

Starting</span> section</a>.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Write</span>&mdash;Write the input files for the job but do not start it. 
The file names are based on the current job name, and the files are written to
a subdirectory of the current working directory that is named with the job
name.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Reset Panel</span>&mdash;Reset the values in the panel to 
their defaults.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Job status</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>This icon indicates when there are jobs running for the application that
belong to the current project. It starts spinning when the first job starts, and
stops when there are no more jobs running. If a job fails to start, it changes
to an exclamation point. 
</p>
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/job_status.png" />
<p>
Clicking the button shows a small job status window that lists the job name and
status for all active jobs submitted from the current panel (for Jaguar and
MacroModel this means all jobs from any of the application panels). You can
double-click on a row to open the <a href="../misc/monitor_panel.html"><span
class="GUI">Monitor</span> panel</a> and monitor the job, or click the <span
class="GUI">Monitor</span> button to open the <span class="GUI">Monitor</span>
panel and close the job status window. The job status is updated while the
window is open. If a job finishes while the window is open, the job remains
displayed but with the new status.  The rows are colored according to the
status: yellow for submitted, green for launched, running, or finished, red for
incorporated, died, or killed.  Click anywhere outside the window to close it.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Run</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Run the job with the current job settings.
</p></dd>
</dl>


<a name="status_bar"></a>
<p>The status bar displays information about the current job settings for the
panel. This includes the job name, task name and task settings (if any), number
of subjobs (if any) and the host name and job incorporation setting. It also
displays a message for a short time when you start a new job.</p>
<p>The status bar also contains the <span class="GUI">Help</span> button, which
opens the help topic for the panel.</p>
