<h2>Summary</h2>

<p> SiteMap is a tool for finding, visualizing and characterizing protein
binding sites. Sites are represented as collections of site points at or near
the surface of a protein that are contiguous or are separated in solvent-exposed
region by short gaps that could plausibly be spanned by ligand functionality.
The visualization uses a grid of points to identify potential hydrophobic and
hydrophilic regions; the hydrophilic regions are further classified into
hydrogen-bond donor, hydrogen-bond acceptor, and metal-binding regions, and the
surface of the protein is contoured. These regions can be displayed in the
Workspace.</p>

<p>Key properties, including an overall SiteScore that gauges the propensity of
the site to bind ligands tightly, are returned to the Project Table.
Other properties measure the exposure of the site to solvent, its degree of
enclosure by the protein, the tightness with which the site points interact with
the protein (&quot;contact&quot;), the degree of hydrophobicity of the site, the
degree of hydrophilicity, the balance between the two, and the extent to which a
ligand would be likely to donate, rather than accept, hydrogen bonds
(&quot;don/acc&quot;). SiteScore and the contact, phobic, and philic properties
are expressed relative to the average value found for a large number of protein
sites that bind ligands tightly.</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the SiteMap Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">SiteMap</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Applications &rarr; SiteMap</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
</ul>


<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the SiteMap Panel</h2> 


<p>
To set up a SiteMap calculation:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Display the protein in the Workspace. If you want to find all sites,
ensure that only the protein is displayed, without cofactors, waters, or
ligands. If you want to map a particular site that is defined by a molecule,
include that molecule in the Workspace along with the protein.
</p></li>
<li><p>Open the <span class="GUI">SiteMap</span> panel.
</p></li>
<li><p>Select the task in the <span class="GUI">Specify task</span> section.
If you want to characterize a single region, you must also select a molecule or
entry to be used to define the region to be characterized. The atoms of this
molecule or entry must not be part of the protein.
</p></li>
<li><p>Make any settings in the <span class="GUI">Settings</span> section
to define the sites and the output.
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Job Settings</span> from the <span
class="GUI">Settings</span> button menu,</p>
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/settings.png" />
<p>set the job parameters in the <span class="GUI">Job Settings</span> dialog
box, and click <span class="GUI">Run</span> to run the job.
</p></li>
</ol>
<p>When the job is finished, the site maps are incorporated and displayed in the
Workspace. The <span class="GUI">Manage Surfaces</span> panel is also opened so
that you can manage the display of the site maps.

<a name="feature2"></a>
<h3>Task Section</h3>

<p>In this section you can choose whether to examine the entire protein for
potential binding sites, or restrict the search to a given region.
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#feature2.1"><span class="GUI">Identify top-ranked
potential receptor binding sites</span> option</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature2.2"><span class="GUI">Evaluate a single
binding site region</span> option</a></li>
</ul>

<dl>

<a name="feature2.1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Identify top-ranked potential receptor binding
sites</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Identify potential binding sites on the surface of the receptor, rank
them  and return the top-ranking sites. The atoms in the Workspace are taken to
be the receptor, so you should ensure that only the receptor is displayed. 
This is the default option.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature2.2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Evaluate a single binding site region</span> option</dt>

<dd><p>This option allows you to evaluate the region of the receptor that is
within a specified distance of selected non-receptor atoms, such as a
ligand. You can set the distance in the <span class="GUI">Region about selected
atoms plus <i>N</i>&nbsp;&Aring; buffer will be examined</span> text box. The
atoms can be selected in the <span class="GUI">Select non-receptor atoms
defining region to evaluate</span> section. You can pick an entry or a molecule
using the <span class="GUI">Pick</span> menu. The identity of the structure you
pick is shown in the <span class="GUI">ASL</span> text box. The <span
class="GUI">X</span> button clears the ASL expression. If you have <span
class="GUI">Show markers</span> selected, the picked atoms are marked in the
Workspace. You must have only the receptor and the picked structure in the
Workspace, as everything that is not the picked structure is taken to be the
receptor.
</p></dd>

<h3>Settings Section</h3>

<p>This section provides basic controls for the site search and display of the site maps.
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#feature3.1"><span class="GUI">Require at least <i>n</i> site
points per reported site</span> text box</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature3.2"><span class="GUI">Report up to <i>n</i>
sites</span> text box</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature3.3"><span class="GUI">Use definition of
hydrophobicity</span> option menu</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature3.4"><span class="GUI">Use grid</span> option
menu</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature3.5"><span class="GUI">Crop SiteMaps at <i>d</i>
&Aring; from nearest site point</span> text box</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature3.7"><span class="GUI">Detect shallow binding sites</span>
option</a></li>
</ul>

<dl>

<a name="feature3.1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Require at least <i>n</i> site points per reported
site</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>Set the minimum number of site point required to define a site. The default value
is 15 site points; with default settings the average number in examined sites
that bind ligands tightly is
150. This minimum applies to the second and subsequent sites; SiteMap always reports
at least one site that contains the minimum number of points required to recognize a
site, which is 3. This setting is not relevant when you select
<span class="GUI">Characterize a single binding site region</span>.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature3.2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Report up to <i>n</i> sites</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>Specify the number of sites to report in the output. Sites are ordered by the
number of points they contain. The default is 5 sites. This option is not available if
<span class="GUI">Characterize a single binding site region</span>
is selected.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature3.3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Use definition of hydrophobicity</span> option menu</dt>
<dd><p>Choose from <span class="GUI">more restrictive</span> and
<span class="GUI">less restrictive</span>. The more restrictive option
excludes points that border on too many assigned philic points, that have too
few neighbors that are classified as phobic or inside the protein, or that border
on too many points that occupy free space. In addition, regions that are exposed
to solvent are assigned reduced hydrophobicity. The less restrictive option
includes all points that are initially classified as phobic and does not apply these
exclusions and modifications.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature3.4"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Use grid</span> option
menu</dt>
<dd><p>Set the size of the grid to use in computing the displayed site maps. The choices of
<span class="GUI">coarse</span>, <span class="GUI">standard</span>,
and <span class="GUI">fine</span> correspond to grid spacings of
1.0&nbsp;&Aring;, 0.7&nbsp;&Aring;, and 0.35&nbsp;&Aring;. This choice has no effect
on the grids used for locating and analyzing sites.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature3.5"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Crop SiteMaps at <i>d</i> &Aring; from nearest site
point</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>The default distance from the nearest site point at which to crop the
individual site maps for display. The default choice is 4&nbsp;&Aring;. This
option does not affect the data, only the display. A different value can be
specified later in the <span class="GUI">Manage Surfaces</span> panel.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature3.7"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Detect shallow binding sites</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Detect shallow binding sites suitable for protein-protein interactions,
by decreasing the amount of enclosure and the threshold for van der Waals
interactions. 
</p></dd>

</dl>

<a name="job_toolbar"></a>
