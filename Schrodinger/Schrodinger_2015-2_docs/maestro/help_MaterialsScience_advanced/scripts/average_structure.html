<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Calculate the weighted average structure from a set of conformers selected in
the Project Table. Either the average structure (which might not have physical
geometry) is added to the Project Table, or the input structure closest to the
average structure (the &quot;representative&quot; structure) is selected and
placed in the Workspace. The RMSD from the average structure can be added as a
property to each structure.</p>  

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Calculate Average Structure Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Calculate Average Structure</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Tools &rarr; Scripts &rarr; General Tools &rarr; Average Structure</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
</ul>

<a name="feature1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Average calculation mode</span> options</dt>
<dd><p>Select the option for the result you want from the calculation. The
weighted average structure is always calculated. 
</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="GUI">Generate average structure</span>&mdash;Add the
weighted average structure to the Project Table. This structure is likely to be
unphysical, as it involves averaging the coordinates of each atom.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Select representative structure</span>&mdash;Select the
structure with the smallest RMSD from the average structure and place it in the
Workspace.</li>
</ul>

</dd>

<a name="feature2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Weighting method</span> options</dt>
<dd><p>Select an option for weighting the structures in the average structure. 
</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="GUI">Uniform weighting</span>&mdash;Use the same weight for
each structure.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Property weighting</span>&mdash;Weight the structures by
the value of a property. Clicking <span class="GUI">Choose Property</span> opens
a property selector, in which you can choose the property from those available
in the project. Filtering by family and by text matching is available in the
property selector. The property is displayed in the text box next to the
button.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Boltzmann weighting</span>&mdash;Weight the structures by
their Boltzmann population at a specified temperature. You can set the
temperature in the <span class="GUI">Temperature</span> text box. The
populations are calculated from a specified energy property, which you choose by
clicking <span class="GUI">Choose Property</span> and making a choice from the
project properties in the property selector that opens. Filtering by family and
by text matching is available in the property selector. The energy units can be
set by choosing one of the <span class="GUI">Property scale</span> options.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<a name="feature3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Before calculation, superimpose all on first selected entry</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Superimpose the selected entries on the first selected entry before
calculating the average structure. This action changes the coordinates of all of
the selected structures except the first (which is used as the reference).
</p></dd>

<a name="feature4"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Atoms for RMSD</span> options</dt>
<dd><p>Select an option for superimposing the structures and calculating the
RMSD for the structures, from <span class="GUI">All atoms</span>, 
<span class="GUI">Heavy atoms and polar hydrogens</span> (all atoms except
nonpolar hydrogens), and <span class="GUI">Heavy atoms</span> (no hydrogens).
The RMSD calculation is used for selecting the representative structure. 
</p></dd>

<a name="feature5"></a>
<dt>Check symmetry in RMSD comparisons</dt>
<dd><p>When comparing structures for the RMSD, check for local symmetry in the
connectivity (such as ring orientation) that could reduce the RMSD, and use the
lowest RMSD value.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature6"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Create RMSD-to-Avg property in Project Table</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Create a project property that stores the RMSD between the structures and
the average structure, named <span class="GUI">RMSD-to-Avg</span>.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature7"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Close after running</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Close the panel after the job has been run.

<dt><span class="GUI">Job name</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>Enter a name for the job in this text box.
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Settings</span> button menu</dt>
<dd><p>This button opens the <a href="../misc/job_settings.html"><span
class="GUI">Job Settings</span> dialog box</a>. The arrow to the right opens
a menu, from which you can make settings or perform actions that are related to
the job. </p>
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/settings.png" />
<p>The menu items are described below.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="GUI">Job Settings</span>&mdash;Make and save settings for the
incorporation of the job into the Maestro project, the job name, the host,
the distribution of subjobs, and any other application-specific job settings.
Opens the <span class="GUI">Job Settings</span> dialog box.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Preferences</span>&mdash;Set general preferences for
running jobs. Opens the <span class="GUI">Preferences</span> panel at the <a
href="../maestro_menu/preferences.html#jobs_starting"><span class="GUI">Jobs - 
Starting</span> section</a>.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Write</span>&mdash;Write the input files for the job but do not start it. 
The file names are based on the current job name, and the files are written to
a subdirectory of the current working directory that is named with the job
name.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Job status</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>This icon indicates when there are jobs running for the application that
belong to the current project. It starts spinning when the first job starts, and
stops when there are no more jobs running. If a job fails to start, it changes
to an exclamation point. 
</p>
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/job_status.png" />
<p>
Clicking the button shows a small job status window that lists the job name and
status for all active jobs submitted from the current panel (for Jaguar and
MacroModel this means all jobs from any of the application panels). You can
double-click on a row to open the <a href="../misc/monitor_panel.html"><span
class="GUI">Monitor</span> panel</a> and monitor the job, or click the <span
class="GUI">Monitor</span> button to open the <span class="GUI">Monitor</span>
panel and close the job status window. The job status is updated while the
window is open. If a job finishes while the window is open, the job remains
displayed but with the new status.  The rows are colored according to the
status: yellow for submitted, green for launched, running, or finished, red for
incorporated, died, or killed.  Click anywhere outside the window to close it.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Run</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Run the job with the current job settings.
</p></dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<a name="status_bar"></a>
<dt>Status bar</dt>
<dd><p>The status bar displays information about the current job settings for the
panel. This includes the job name, task name and task settings (if any), number
of subjobs (if any) and the host name and job incorporation setting. It also
displays a message for a short time when you start a new job.</p>
<p>The status bar also contains the <span class="GUI">Help</span> button, which
opens the help topic for the panel.</p>
