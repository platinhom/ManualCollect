<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>This panel allows you to humanize an antibody by mutating residues to create
a more human-compatible protein.  Appropriate sites for mutation can be found by
comparing the antibody to homologs and identifying residues that satisfy various
criteria, such as solvent accessibility, maximum number of side-chain
interactions with either the antigen or with the antibody itself.</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Antibody Humanization: Residue Mutation Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Antibody Humanization: Residue Mutation</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Applications &rarr; More Applications &rarr; BioLuminate &rarr; Antibody Modeling &rarr; Humanization &rarr; Residue Mutation</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
</ul>


<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Antibody Humanization: Residue Mutation Panel</h2> 


<p>The basic workflow in this panel is:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Import a structure into the workflow, either from the Workspace or from a
Maestro file (<span class="GUI">Import structure from</span>).
</p></li>
<li><p>Select the chains to be treated as the &quot;ligand&quot;.
</p></li>
<li><p>Click <span class="GUI">Homology Criteria</span>. 
</p></li>
<li><p>(Optional) Choose the antibody databases that are used to search for
homologs.
</p></li>
<li><p>Run the search (<span class="GUI">Search Antibody Database for
Homologs</span>) and align the homologs (<span class="GUI">Align
Homologs</span>).
</p></li>
<li><p>(Optional) Select an option for the chain to show, and examine the
alignment for that chain.
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose the regions that you want to substitute residues in. 
</p></li>
<li><p>Specify the criteria for automatic selection of residues, in the 
<span class="GUI">Selection by homology criteria</span> and <span
class="GUI">Parent structure 3D criteria</span> sections. 
</p></li>
<li><p>Click <span class="GUI">Save</span>.</p>
<p>The <span class="GUI">Homology Suggestions</span> dialog box closes, and the
mutations identified from the homology model and the applied criteria are set in
the residues table. The mutants are set to the variations seen in the homologs.
</p></li>
<li><p>Make any changes to the residues marked for mutation, by clicking in
the <span class="GUI">Mutations</span> column of the table and selecting from
the popup that is displayed. You can also use the tools above the table.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose the properties to calculate. <span class="GUI">Affinity</span> and
<span class="GUI">pKa</span> are not selected by default as they take longer
than the other properties.
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Job Settings</span> from the <span
class="GUI">Settings</span> button menu,</p>
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/settings.png" />
<p>set the job parameters in the <span class="GUI">Job Settings</span> dialog
box, and click <span class="GUI">Run</span> to run the job.
</p>
<p>The mutated structures are incorporated into the project as new entries, and
the <span class="GUI">Humanize Antibody Viewer</span> opens.
</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Only one site is mutated at a time to produce a mutated structure: multiple 
simultaneous mutations are not performed. The number of structures is linear in
both the number of sites mutated and the number of mutations at each site (it is
in fact the sum of the number of mutations at each site).  The number of
mutation sites and the total number of mutations is reported below the table. 
</p>
<p>If you want to perform mutations on other parts of the antibody, for example
to mutate the antigen and the antibody at the same time, you can use the 
<a href="residue_scanning.html"><span class="GUI">Residue Scanning</span>
panel</a>.

<h3>Import tools</h3>
<p>The import tools allow you to import a protein structure into the workflow for
residue mutation. You can choose an option from the <span class="GUI">Import
structure from</span> option menu to use the entire structure in the Workspace,
the selected residues in the Workspace, or a structure from a Maestro file. For
the first two options, click the <span class="GUI">Import</span> button to
import and analyze the structure. If importing from a file, the button changes
to <span class="GUI">Browse</span>, and you can click this button to open a file
selector to locate and open the file.
</p>

<a name="suggestions"></a>
<h3>Homology Criteria button</h3>
<p>Select residues to mutate based on suggestions from homologous
proteins. When you click this button, the 
<a href="antibody_mutation_homology_suggestions.html"><span class="GUI">Homology
Suggestions</span> dialog box</a> opens, in which you can build a homology model
for a chain and select residues by conservation or structural criteria. Clicking
<span class="GUI">Save</span> in this dialog box selects the suggested residues
in the residue table of the <span class="GUI">Residues</span> tab and sets the
mutations for the residue to the residues in the homologs that differ from the
query.
</p>
<a name="residues"></a>
<h3>Residues tab</h3>
<p>In this tab you select the residues for mutation, and choose the mutations
for each of these residues.

Residues</span> dialog box, in which you can limit the selection of residues by
chain, solvent exposure, or residue type (including nonstandard residues). All
residues that meet the criteria are selected in the residues table when you
click <span class="GUI">OK</span> in the dialog box. The setting on
the <span class="GUI">Mutate</span> option menu is switched
to <span class="GUI">Selected residues</span>, as the dialog box is 
simply a means of selecting residues. 
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Atom selection</span>&mdash;Select residues for
setting up mutations by general atom selection procedures. Opens the 
<a href="../misc/asd.html"><span class="GUI">Atom Selection</span> dialog box</a>,
in which you can make selections by combinations of criteria. All residues that
meet the criteria are selected in the residues table when you
click <span class="GUI">OK</span> in the dialog box. The setting on
the <span class="GUI">Mutate</span> option menu is switched
to <span class="GUI">Selected residues</span>, as use of the dialog box is
simply a means of selecting residues.

the menu, and click <span class="GUI">Apply</span> to apply these mutations to
the residues that are selected in the table. The popup allows selection of
individual residues, selection by type, and the selection can include

<dt>Residues table</dt>
<dd><p>Table containing a list of all the residues in the Workspace that were
included in the analysis, and so can be considered for mutation. This table can
be used to define and list the mutations for each residue. You can select
multiple rows in the table, for example to set a common set of mutations. The
number of residues selected and the total are reported below the table. Residues
that are selected in the table are also selected in the Workspace. The table
lists properties of the residues that may be useful for choosing residues to
mutate.</p>

class="GUI">Surface Complementarity</span></td>
<td>If the residue is at the interface between two chains, the surface
complementarity of the residue to residues in the other chain is evaluated and
displayed in this column. The surface complementarity measures how well the
shape of one surface matches the shape of the other. It is calculated from the
scalar product of the normal to one surface at each surface point and the normal
to the other surface at the point nearest to the first surface, with a weighting 
factor for the distance between the points. The score is the normalized sum over
surface points, such that perfect complementarity (parallel normals) has a value
of 1, and no complementarity has a value of 0. It is evaluated over the buried
solvent-accessible surface area. (See Lawrence, M. C.; Colman, P. M. <i>J. Mol. 
Biol.</i>, <b>1993</b>, <i>234</i>, 946&ndash;950.) <br/>
