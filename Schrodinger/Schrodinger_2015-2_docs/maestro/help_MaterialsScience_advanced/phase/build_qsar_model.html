<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
In this step, you build QSAR models for the selected hypotheses, using the
activity data for the ligands that match the hypotheses. You can choose
different training sets and test sets, and visualize the model results. The
models are built by a partial least squares (PLS) regression, in which
progressively more PLS factors are included in the model. When you have built
the models, you can use them to visualize parts of the ligands that contribute
positively or negatively to activity, and to predict activities of matches to
the hypotheses. The model is stored in the run, and can be used to predict
activities during a database search. When you have completed this step, you can
export the hypotheses used to build the models to an external file for use with
other projects, and you can continue directly to a search for matches
to the hypothesis.
</p>


<a name="working"></a> 
<h2>Working in the Build QSAR Model Step</h2> 

<p>The main tasks in this step are to build a set of QSAR models for each
hypothesis selected in the <span class="GUI">Score Hypotheses</span> step
and use them to visualize parts of the ligands that contribute positively or
negatively to activity. The models are stored in the run, and can be used to
predict activities during a search for matches.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> To make hypotheses with their QSAR models available in the
<a href="find_matches.html"><span class="GUI">Advanced Pharmacophore Screening
</span> panel</a>, you must either export them, or select them and click
<span class="GUI">Search for Matches</span>.</p>

<a name="BuildQSAR3.1"></a>
<h3>Choosing a Training Set and a Test Set</h3>

<p>The first task in this step is to choose a training set and a test set, and
exclude ligands that you do not want in either set. Initially, all ligands are
selected for the training set. You can change the status of a ligand by clicking
in the <span class="GUI">QSAR Set</span> column for the
ligand in the <span class="GUI">Alignments</span> table. The status
cycles between <span class="GUI">training</span>, <span class="GUI">test</span>, and blank, which means that the ligand is
excluded from both sets. You can change the status of all selected ligands by
control-clicking in the <span class="GUI">QSAR Set</span> column for
one of the ligands. It does not matter which set of alignments is displayed
in the Alignments table: all ligands are listed, and the choice of QSAR sets
applies to all hypotheses. </p>

<p>You can select a random fraction of the included ligands for the training set by
entering a percentage in the <span class="GUI">Random training
set</span> text box and clicking <span class="GUI">Apply</span>. The
specified percentage of ligands is selected at random from the existing training
and test sets and assigned to the training set. The remainder are assigned to
the test set. The seed for the random selection can be set in the
<a href="build_qsar_model_options.html"><span class="GUI">Build QSAR
Model &mdash; Options</span> dialog box.</a> </p>

<a name="BuildQSAR3.2"></a>
<h3>Choosing a QSAR Model Type</h3>

<p>Phase offers two types of QSAR model: an atom-based model and a
pharmacophore-based model. The selection of the model can be done in the
<a href="build_qsar_model_options.html">
<span class="GUI">Build QSAR Model &mdash; Options</span> dialog box,</a>
which you open by clicking <span class="GUI">Options</span>.
</p>

<p>To choose which kind of model you want to build, select
<span class="GUI">Atom-based</span> or
<span class="GUI">Pharmacophore-based</span> under
<span class="GUI">Model type</span>.
The default model is an atom-based model.</p>

<p>The atom-based model uses a van der Waals model of atoms, and divides them into
six classes as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>D -- Hydrogen-bond donor</li>
<li>H -- Hydrophobic or nonpolar </li>
<li>N -- Negative ionic </li>
<li>P -- Positive ionic </li>
<li>W -- Electron-withrawing (includes hydrogen-bond acceptors) </li>
<li>X -- Miscellaneous (all other types) </li>
</ul>
<p>The atom-based model therefore treats the entire molecule. It is useful when
features other than the pharmacophores are important to activity, such as steric
clashes. However, its performance generally decreases as the diversity of the
training set increases. </p>

<p>The pharmacophore-based model uses pharmacophore features with a specified
radius as the basis of the model. Only the pharmacophore features that are
present in the hypothesis are used in the QSAR model. To specify the radii of
the pharmacophore features, edit the values in the <span class="GUI">Tolerance</span> column.</p>

<p>The pharmacophore-based model assumes that the activity is explained entirely
by the pharmacophore model itself, and therefore cannot predict activities where
other features are important to activity, such as steric clashes.</p>

<a name="BuildQSAR3.3"></a>
<h3>Specifying Options for the Models</h3>

<p>Options for the QSAR model are specified in the
<a href="build_qsar_model_options.html">
<span class="GUI">Build QSAR Model &mdash; Options</span> dialog box,</a>
which you open by clicking <span class="GUI">Options</span>.</p>

<p>The QSAR model partitions the space occupied by the ligands into a cubic
grid. Any atom or feature can occupy part of one or more cubes. A cube is
occupied by an atom or a feature if the centroid of the cube is within the van
der Waals radius of the atom or the radius of the feature. You can set the size
of the cubes by changing the value in the <span class="GUI">Grid spacing</span>
text box, and view the grid by clicking <span class="GUI">Preview</span>. </p>

<p>The occupancies of the cubes by different classes of atoms or different
features are used as variables in the partial least squares regression.  The
regression is done by constructing a series of models with an increasing number
of partial least squares (PLS) factors. The accuracy of the models increases
with increasing PLS factors until over-fitting starts to occur. The default
number of PLS factors is N/5, where N is the number of ligands. You can adjust
this to a lower value in the <span class="GUI">Maximum PLS factors</span> text
box.</p>

<a name="BuildQSAR3.4"></a>
<h3>Examining the QSAR Model</h3>

<p>If you have more than one PLS factor, you should examine the models produced
to select the best model. For example, you can examine the predicted activities
for the test set, and see at what point they begin to degrade, or you can
compare the the training set errors with the experimental uncertainty in the
data.</p>

<p>You can also visualize the QSAR model in the Workspace, and break it down
into its components for each atom or feature type. To visualize the model, click
the <span class="GUI">View QSAR model</span> button on the toolbar, or choose
<span class="GUI">QSAR Model</span> from the <span class="GUI">Display</span>
menu. The cubes that represent the model are displayed in the Workspace, colored
according to the sign of their coefficient values.</p>

<p>To adjust the display appearance and to select features for display, click
<span class="GUI">QSAR Visualization Settings</span>. The <a
href="qsar_vis_settings.html"><span class="GUI">QSAR Visualization
Settings</span> panel</a> is displayed. In this panel you can choose to view
volumes for the QSAR models or for the ligands, view volumes for each atom class
or feature separately or for all atom classes or features, change the number of
PLS factors to view the different models, adjust thresholds for display of
coefficients and adjust the transparency of the cubes.</p>

<p>The visualization tools allow you to identify features of ligand structures
that are likely to contribute to higher or lower activity. For example, if you
select <span class="GUI">Workspace ligands</span> under <span class="GUI">View
volume occupied by</span> and choose an atom type from the <span
class="GUI">Selected atom class</span> list in the <span class="GUI">QSAR
Visualization Settings</span> panel, you can include the ligands in the
Workspace one by one and see which parts of all ligands have a positive or a
negative contribution to the activity due to the chosen atom type. This might
give some clues to what functional groups are desirable or undesirable at
certain positions in a molecule. </p>

<p>You can also view the hypothesis, including distances and angles between
features, and excluded volumes, using the toolbar buttons.</p>
