<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Calculate the passive membrane permeability of a set of congeneric ligands.

<h2>Opening the Membrane Permeability Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Membrane Permeability</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Applications &rarr; More Applications &rarr; Physics-Based ADME/Tox &rarr; Membrane Permeability</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
</ul>


<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Membrane Permeability Panel</h2> 


<p>This panel allows you to calculate the passive membrane permeability of a set
of molecules. It is primarily intended for use on congeneric series of ligands
to evaluate the relative permeability of similar ligands.</p>
<p>The calculations are based on a physical model with the assumptions that the
permeability is dominated by the free energy of desolvation and change of state
(neutralization and tautomerization) on passing into the membrane. The membrane
is modeled as a low-dielectric continuum, and water as a high-dielectric
continuum. A conformational search is performed in both the high-dielecric and
low-dielectric continuum and the low-energy conformers from each are evaluated.
Macrocycles are treated with a special algorithm. The highest value of the
permeability found from this ensemble is used as the permeability for that
molecule.
</p>
<p>The calculations can take several minutes per molecule. The molecules should
be all-atom 3D structures in a reasonable geometry. You can use LigPrep to
convert 2D structures or SMILES strings to 3D structures.
</p>

<p>For further details, see Leung et al., <i>J. Chem. Inf. Model.</i>
<b>2012</b>, <i>52</i>, 1621.
</p>

<p>The main results of the calculation are the structures of the ligands in the
conformation that is predicted to be the most likely conformation inside
the membrane, four Maestro free energy properties, given in kcal/mol, and the
logarithm of the predicted RRCK permeability in cm/s:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="GUI">Membrane dG Insert</span>&mdash;The total free energy
penalty for the ligand to change state and enter the membrane. This
is the sum of <span class="GUI">Membrane HDLD</span> and <span
class="GUI">Membrane StatePenalty</span>, described below.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Membrane HDLD</span>&mdash;The free energy penalty for the
neutral form of the ligand in its conformation inside the membrane to enter the
membrane (i.e., move from the high dielectric region to the low dielectric
region, hence HDLD).</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Membrane StatePenalty</span>&mdash;The free energy penalty
for neutralizing (or tautomerizing) the ligand.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Membrane HDLD alternate</span>&mdash;The free energy
penalty for the neutral form of the ligand to enter the membrane and change
conformation between the most likely conformation in each phase. This is an
alternative that allows for conformational change on entering the membrane.</li> 
<li><span class="GUI">Log Perm RRCK</span>&mdash;Logarithm of the RRCK
permeability in cm/s. This property is optimized to reproduce RRCK permeability
assay results, with fitted energy and volume terms.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can visualize the contributions to the Membrane HDLD property by atom in
the <a href="../prime/energy_visualizer.html"><span class="GUI">Prime Energy
Visualizer</span> panel</a>.
</p>
<p>If you want to run the calculations from the command line, use the following
command:</p>
<p><code>structurebased_adme permeability </code><i>structure-file</i>
</p>
<p>Enter this command with the <code>-h</code> option for information on options.

<dt><span class="GUI">Job status</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>This icon indicates when there are jobs running for the application that

<p>
Clicking the button shows a small job status window that lists the job name and
status for all active jobs submitted from the current panel (for Jaguar and
MacroModel this means all jobs from any of the application panels). You can
double-click on a row to open the <a href="../misc/monitor_panel.html"><span
class="GUI">Monitor</span> panel</a> and monitor the job, or click the <span
class="GUI">Monitor</span> button to open the <span class="GUI">Monitor</span>
panel and close the job status window. The job status is updated while the
window is open. If a job finishes while the window is open, the job remains
displayed but with the new status.  The rows are colored according to the
status: yellow for submitted, green for launched, running, or finished, red for
incorporated, died, or killed.  Click anywhere outside the window to close it.
