<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>The <span class="GUI">Constraints</span> tab of the <span
class="GUI">Receptor Grid Generation</span> panel is used to define Glide
constraints for the receptor grids to be generated.  Glide constraints are
receptor-ligand interactions that you believe to be important to the binding
mode. Up to ten constraints can be defined in a grid generation job.  When you
run Glide docking jobs, you can select as required interactions a subset of the
constraints defined in the receptor grids, up to a limit of four.  By setting
such requirements, you can often significantly enrich the final results and
speed up docking, as Glide is able to discard ligands, conformations, or
poses that do not meet these criteria early on in their evaluation for docking
suitability.</p>

<p>
There are five types of constraints available: positional constraints, NOE
constraints, H-bond constraints, metal constraints, metal coordination
constraints. </p>
<ul>
<li>A positional constraint is a requirement that an atom in the ligand lies in a
sphere whose center is at a particular position. This is the most general kind
of constraint.</li>
<li>An NOE constraint is similar to a positional constraint, requiring that an
atom in the ligand lies in a spherical shell centered at a particular
position. It only differs from a positional constraint in having a smaller sphere
from which the ligand atom is excluded.</li>
<li>An H-bond constraint is a requirement that a ligand atom interact with a
specified receptor atom (or one related to it by symmetry), through a hydrogen
bond.</li>
<li>A metal constraint is a requirement that a ligand atom lies in a sphere
around a specified receptor metal atom. The constraint on the ligand atom 
has no directionality.</li>
<li> A metal coordination constraint is a requirement that a ligand atom lie
within a given distance of an optimal coordination site for a metal atom. It
differs from a metal constraint in that the constraint sphere is centered on 
a potential ligand coordinating atom rather than the metal, and is thus
directional. </li>
</ul>
<p>The H atoms in flexible receptor groups cannot be used for constraints.

<h2>Constraints Tab Features</h2> 


<ul>
<li><a href="#feature1">Defined constraints counter</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature2"><span class="GUI">Positional/NOE</span> subtab</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature3"><span class="GUI">H-bond/Metal</span> subtab</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature5"><span class="GUI">Metal Coordination</span> subtab</a></li>
</ul>

<a name="feature1"></a>
<h3>Defined Constraints Counter</h3>

<p>The total number of constraints that have been defined so far is
displayed at the top of the tab:</p>

<p><i>N</i><span class="GUI"> constraints have been defined (limit is
10 total)</span>
</p>

<p>The number <i>N</i> is the sum of the numbers of positional or NOE,
H-bond/metal, and metal coordination constraints. These numbers are
displayed in parentheses in the tabs of each subtab.</p>

<a name="feature2"></a>
<h3>Positional/NOE Subtab</h3>

<p>This subtab provides tools for defining positional and NOE (nuclear
Overhauser effect) constraints. Positional constraints are defined as spheres 
that specified atoms of the ligands must occupy. NOE constraints are similarly
defined as spherical shells (the region between two spheres) that specified
atoms of the ligands must occupy.</p>

</ul>

<dl>
<a name="feature2.1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Positions</span> table</dt>
<dd><p>
This table displays the positional constraints you have chosen, giving the name
and coordinates of the sphere center. For positional constraints a maximum
distance is shown, which is the radius of the constraint sphere; for NOE
constraints a minimum and a maximum distance are shown. The coordinates and the
radius are given in angstroms.  You can select a single constraint in the table,
and edit the coordinates and radii of the spheres by clicking in the table cell
and changing the value, or delete the constraint by clicking the <span
class="GUI">Delete</span> button.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature2.2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Show markers</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>
This option is selected by default. The selected constraint is marked by a
yellow sphere. The other positional constraints are marked by red spheres.
Deselect this option to remove the markers.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature2.3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Label positions</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>
This option is selected by default. If <span class="GUI">Show
markers</span> is selected, this option displays the name of the constraint in
the Workspace. The labels are colored the same as the constraints.
Deselect this option to remove the labels.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature2.4"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">New</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>
To add a positional constraint or an NOE constraint, click the <span
class="GUI">New</span> button. This button opens the <span class="GUI">New
position/NOE</span> dialog box, in which you can pick atoms with the standard
<a href="../misc/picking_controls.html">picking controls</a> to
define the centroid of the constraint; name the constraint; select the
constraint type (<span class="GUI">Position</span> or <span
class="GUI">NOE</span>); specify the radius for a positional constraint, or the
minimum and maximum distance for an NOE constraint.  The position is the
centroid of the selected atoms, and must be inside the enclosing box. While
picking is in progress, the constraint is marked with a gray sphere. For NOE
constraints, both spheres are displayed. When you click OK, the constraint is
added to the table if it is inside the enclosing box; otherwise a warning is
displayed.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature2.5"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Delete</span> and <span class="GUI">Delete All</span>
buttons</dt>
<dd><p>
To delete a single positional constraint, select it in the table and click 
<span class="GUI">Delete</span>. To delete all the listed constraints, click
<span class="GUI">Delete All</span>.

<h3>H-bond/Metal Subtab</h3>

<p>The <span class="GUI">H-bond/Metal</span> subtab contains controls
for setting up hydrogen-bonding or metal constraints:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#feature3.1"><span class="GUI">Receptor atoms</span> table</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature3.2"><span class="GUI">Pick atoms</span> option</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature3.3"><span class="GUI">Show markers</span> option</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature3.4"><span class="GUI">Label atoms</span> option</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature3.5"><span class="GUI">Delete</span>
and <span class="GUI">Delete All</span> buttons</a></li>
</ul>

<dl>

<a name="feature3.1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Receptor atoms</span> table</dt>
<dd>
<p>As you select atoms in the receptor, they appear in this table. Each
constraint is identified by a name and an atom specification. A default
constraint name is supplied. You can change the name by editing the table
cell. The atom specification is given in the following format:</p>
<pre>
atom_number:chain: residue_name residue_number : atom_name : symmetry_set
</pre>
<p>where</p>
<ul>
<li><tt>atom_number</tt> = Maestro atom number</li>
<li><tt>chain</tt> = chain name</li>
<li><tt>residue_number</tt> = residue number + insertion code</li>
<li><tt>atom_name</tt> = PDB atom name</li>
<li><tt>symmetry_set</tt> = atom name or symmetry-equivalent atom set</li>
</ul>

<p>For example:</p>
<p><span class="GUI">341:C:ASN 239 : OD1: OD1</span></p>
<p>If the picked atom is part of a symmetry-equivalent set,
its identification is followed by square brackets
enclosing the number and name of each atom in the set,
separated by commas:</p>
<p><span class="GUI">2203:C:GLU 192 : OE2:[2203: OE2,2202: OE1]</span>
</p>

<p>Symmetry can be turned on or off by selecting or clearing the check box in
the <span class="GUI">Use Symmetry</span> column. If you clear the check box,
only the atom that you pick is used for the constraint, and the symmetry
information is removed from the <span class="GUI">Atom</span> column. Symmetry
is on by default.
</p>

</dd>

<a name="feature3.2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Pick atoms</span></dt>
<dd><p>
When this option is selected, you can define H-bond/metal constraints by picking
appropriate atoms in the receptor, which must be displayed in the Workspace.  To
define hydrogen bonds, pick any polar H, N, or O atom in the receptor.
(The atom is identified in the status bar when the pointer is over the atom,
as described in the <a href="../workspace/statusbar.html">Status Bar</a> topic.)
Glide automatically identifies symmetry-equivalent atoms as well, for example
the other oxygen in a carboxylate group. The symmetry can be turned on or off in
the <span class="GUI">Use Symmetry</span> column. If it is on, any one of the
symmetry-equivalent atoms will satisfy the constraint. If it is off, the atom
that you picked is used for the constraint. 
To define metal sites, pick the metal atom.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature3.3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Show markers</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>
This option is selected by default. A cross and padlock appear next to each atom
picked, colored light blue for the selected constraint (the last one picked),
and red for unselected constraints. If the picked atom is one of a set of
symmetry-equivalent atoms, all the atoms in the set are marked. Deselect this
option to remove the markers.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature3.4"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Label atoms</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>
This option is selected by default. If <span class="GUI">Show
markers</span> is selected, this option displays the name of the constraint in
the Workspace. The labels are colored the same as the constraints.
Deselect this option to remove the labels.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature3.5"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Delete</span> and <span class="GUI">Delete All</span> buttons</dt>
<dd><p>
To delete a single H-bond or metal constraint, select it in the table
and click the <span class="GUI">Delete</span> button.
To delete all the listed constraints, click the
<span class="GUI">Delete All</span> button.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<a name="feature5"></a>
<h3>Metal Coordination Subtab</h3>

<p>This subtab provides tools for defining constraints to possible coordination
sites of a metal. For each metal, the available coordination sites are
identified, based on the coordination of the metal to the receptor. A constraint
sphere is placed at the ideal location of a ligand donor atom at the available
site. This differs from the metal constraint feature, in which a constraint
sphere is placed on the metal. The metal coordination constraint has
directionality with respect to the metal, whereas the metal constraint has
none. You can choose to use any or none of the sites found for a given metal.

</ul>

<dl>
<a name="feature5.1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Receptor metal atoms</span> table</dt>
<dd><p>
This table displays the metal coordination constraints you have chosen, giving
a name for the set of coordination sites associated with the metal, the
coordinates of the ideal coordination sites, and the maximum distance of a
constrained ligand atom from that site. You can edit the constraint name, the
coordinates and the radii of the spheres by clicking in the appropriate table
cell and changing the value.</p>
<p>When you select a row in the table, the rows for all the other sites
associated with the metal atom are also selected, and the spheres are
highlighted in the Workspace.  Each table row has a column of check boxes
that you can select or deselect to use or ignore each site. When you clear one
of the check boxes, to ignore the site, the sphere in the Workspace is colored
gray and made more transparent.</p>
<p>
To delete the set of sites for a given metal, select a table row for the metal
and click <span class="GUI">Delete</span>.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature5.0"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Pick metal atoms</span></dt>
<dd><p>
Pick receptor metal atoms in the Workspace to define metal coordination
constraints. (The atom is identified in the status bar when the pointer is over
the atom, as described in the <a href="../workspace/statusbar.html">Status
Bar</a> topic.) When a metal is picked, the possible coordination sites are
identified and rows are added to the <span class="GUI">Receptor metal
atoms</span> table with the coordinates of the sphere and the maximum
distance. All of them are selected for use by default. 
</p></dd>

<a name="feature5.4"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Rotate</span></dt>
<dd><p>
Rotate the set of coordination sites around the metal center. This may be
necessary to adjust the orientations of the sites from their
initial locations, so that the constraint spheres cover the desired regions of
space. As coordination orientations can vary considerably in a complex structure
such as a protein, it may be necessary to make some adjustments. 
</p></dd>

<a name="feature5.2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Show markers</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>
This option is selected by default. The selected set of coordination sites are
marked with red spheres, and the other sets are marked with 
yellow spheres. Deselect this option to remove the markers.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature5.3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Label regions</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>
This option is selected by default. If <span class="GUI">Show
markers</span> is selected, this option displays the name of the corresponding
coordination site set in the Workspace on each sphere.
Deselect this option to remove the labels.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature5.5"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Delete</span> and
<span class="GUI">Delete All</span> buttons</dt>
<dd><p>
To delete a single set of coordination sites, select one of the sites in the
table and click the <span class="GUI">Delete</span> button.
To delete all the listed constraints, click the
<span class="GUI">Delete All</span> button.
