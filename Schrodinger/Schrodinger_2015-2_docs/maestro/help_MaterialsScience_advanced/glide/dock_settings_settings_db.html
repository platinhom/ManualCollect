<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>The options in this dialog box define the manner in which Glide
processes the ligand <i>poses</i>
(combinations of position, orientation, and conformation) it generates.
Poses that pass these initial screens enter the final stage of the algorithm,
which involves evaluation and minimization of a grid approximation to the
OPLS-AA nonbonded ligand-receptor interaction energy.</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Settings - Advanced Settings Dialog Box</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Settings - Advanced Settings</span> dialog box, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Click <span class="GUI">Advanced Settings</span> in the 
<span class="GUI">Settings</span> tab of the <span class="GUI">Ligand Docking</span> panel.</p></li>

<h3>Conformer generation section</h3>

<p>This section contains settings related to the generation of conformers of
each ligand. 
</p>

<dl>
<dt><span class="GUI">Energy window for ring sampling</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>The threshold for keeping or discarding ring conformations can be set
in this text box. Ring conformations are discarded if their energies are higher
than that of the lowest conformation by more than the amount specified.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Canonicalize input conformation</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Ensure that the same starting conformation is always used for a given
ligand, regardless of the input conformation or orientation, so that the output
poses do not depend on details of the input structure. This is done by
generating a new set of coordinates for the ligand based only on the
connectivity and stereochemistry.</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Use enhanced sampling</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Enhance the sampling of conformational space by adding variations on the
input structure to the conformational search. 
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Enhance conformational sampling by N times</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>Enhance the conformational sampling by the factor specified in the text
box. This is done by generating variations on the input structure, and using
these as seed structures for conformational sampling.
</p></dd>

</dl>

<h3>Selection of initial poses section</h3>

<p>The options in this section control the way poses pass through the filters
for the initial geometric and complementarity fit between the ligand and
receptor molecules. The grids for this stage contain values of a
<i>scoring function</i> representing how favorable or unfavorable it
would be to place ligand atoms of given general types in given
elementary cubes of the grid. These grids have a constant spacing of
1 &Aring;. The <i>rough score</i> for a given pose (position and
orientation) of the ligand relative to the receptor is simply the sum
of the appropriate grid scores for each of its atoms. By analogy with
energy, favorable scores are negative, and the lower (more negative)
the better. </p>

<p>The initial rough scoring is done on a coarse grid, on which the possible
positions for placing the ligand center are separated by 2 &Aring;, twice
the elementary cube spacing, in X, Y, and Z.  The <i>refinement</i> step
rescores the successful rough-score poses after the particular rigid
translational repositioning of -1, 0, or +1 &Aring; in X, Y, and Z, which
gives the best possible score.  This procedure effectively doubles the
resolution of the scoring screen.</p>

<p>This section contains the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#feature1.1"><span class="GUI">Keep <i>n</i> initial poses per
ligand for the initial phase of docking</span> text box</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature1.2"><span class="GUI">Scoring window for keeping initial
poses</span> text box</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature1.3"><span class="GUI">Keep best <i>m</i> 
poses per ligand for energy minimization</span> text box</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature1.4"><span class="GUI">Use expanded sampling</span>
option</a></li>
</ul>

<dl>
<a name="feature1.1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Keep</span> <i>n</i> <span class="GUI">initial poses per
ligand for the initial phase of docking</span></dt>
<dd><p>This text box sets the maximum number of poses per ligand to pass to the
grid refinement calculation.  The default setting depends on the type of docking
specified and whether Glide constraints have been applied:</p>

<ul>
<li>5000 poses for flexible docking jobs in general.</li>
<li>500 poses for flexible docking jobs to which Glide constraints are applied.</li>
<li>1000 poses for rigid docking jobs
(Glide constraints do not change this value.)</li>
</ul>

<p>You can change the default by entering any integer greater than zero.</p></dd>

<a name="feature1.2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Scoring window for keeping initial poses</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>This text box sets the rough-score cutoff (relative to the best rough score
found so far) for keeping initial poses. The default cutoff window is 100.0,
meaning that to survive, a pose must rough-score within 100.0 of the best pose.
Using the default window, for example, if the best pose found so far has a score
of -60.0, poses with a score more positive than 40.0 will be rejected. You can
change this value from the default to any number greater than zero.</p></dd>

<a name="feature1.3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Keep best</span> <i>m</i> <span class="GUI">
poses per ligand for energy minimization</span> text box</dt>
<dd>
<p>This value allows at most the number of poses specified per ligand to be
energy-minimized on the receptor grid.  The default setting
depends on the type of docking specified:</p>

<ul>
<li>400 poses for flexible SP docking jobs, 800 poses for flexible XP docking
jobs.</li> 
<li>40 poses for flexible docking jobs to which Glide constraints are applied.</li>
<li>100 poses for rigid docking jobs (Glide Constraints do not change this value.)</li>
</ul>

<p>The range for this value for SP docking is 1 to <i>n</i>, where <i>n</i> 
is the value in the <span class="GUI">Keep</span><i>n</i> <span
class="GUI">initial poses per ligand for the initial phase of docking</span>
text box. For XP docking, the range is 800 to 1000.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature1.4"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Use expanded sampling</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Expand the sampling in the rough scoring stage by bypassing the
elimination of initial poses based on the rough score. This option passes many
more poses to the later stages, which is especially useful for fragment
docking to ensure that good poses are found.
</p></dd>

</dl>

<a name="feature2"></a>
<h3>Energy minimization section</h3>

<p>This stage of the docking algorithm evaluates and minimizes poses that are
passed through the <a href="#feature1">Selection of initial poses
</a> scoring phase.</p>

<p>This section contains two settings:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#feature2.1"><span class="GUI">Distance-dependent
dielectric constant</span> text box</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature2.2"><span class="GUI">Maximum number of minimization
steps</span> text box</a></li>
</ul>

<dl>
<a name="feature2.1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Distance-dependent dielectric constant</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>Glide uses a distance-dependent dielectric model in which the effective
dielectric &quot;constant&quot; is the supplied constant multiplied by the
distance between the interacting pair of atoms.  The default setting is 2.0,
and Glide's sampling algorithms are optimized for this value.
Although this text box allows you to 
set the dielectric constant to any real value greater than or equal to
1.0, changing this setting is not recommended.</p></dd>

<a name="feature2.2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Maximum number of minimization steps</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>This text box allows you to alter the maximum number of minimization steps
that are used by the conjugate gradient minimization algorithm. The default
number of steps is 100 but you are allowed to choose any value greater than or
equal to 0.  A &quot;minimization&quot; of 0 steps does a single-point energy
calculation on each pose that survives rough-score screening, or on the single
initial pose if no screening was done.</p></dd>

</dl>

<a name="feature3"></a>
<h3>Count aromatic H and halogen H-bonds section</h3>

<p>These settings control whether aromatic hydrogens are considered to form
hydrogen bonds, whether halogens can form hydrogen bonds as an acceptor or weak
bonds with electronegative atoms (like oxygen) as a donor. These bonds are
treated like other hydrogen bonds: they are included in the rough scoring, in
the final scoring function, and are considered for hydrogen-bond constraints.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><span class="GUI">Include aromatic H as donors</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Select this option to include aromatic ligand hydrogen atoms as donors
during docking.  You can set a cutoff for the partial charge, to filter out
hydrogens that have small partial charges, in the <span class="GUI">Partial
charge cutoff</span> text box. 
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Partial charge cutoff</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>To be considered as a donor, the partial charge on an aromatic hydrogen
must be greater than the value given in this text box.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Include halogens as</span> options</dt>
<dd><p>Select this option to include nonbonded interactions with ligand
halogens. You can choose one of two possibilities for halogen interactions:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="GUI">acceptors</span>&mdash;Treat halogens as acceptors of
hydrogen bonds.
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">donors</span>&mdash;Treat halogens as donors of
nonbonded interactions with electronegative atoms, such as oxygen. This effect
originates in the positive potential on the halogen in line with the bond axis
(sigma hole).
</p></li>
</ul>

</dd>
