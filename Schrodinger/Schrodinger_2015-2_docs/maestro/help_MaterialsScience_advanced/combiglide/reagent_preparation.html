<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
In this panel you can set up and run the job that prepares reagent files for use
in combinatorial screening or combinatorial library enumeration.
</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Reagent Preparation Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Reagent Preparation</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Applications &rarr; More Applications &rarr; CombiGlide &rarr; Reagent Preparation</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
</ul>


<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Reagent Preparation Panel</h2> 


<p>Reagent preparation ensures that the input structures are all-atom, 3D
structures, and that they have the appropriate information stored with them to
construct the molecules that are used in screening or are added to the library.
Apart from 2D-to-3D conversion and structure variation and cleanup, which is
performed by LigPrep, the main task in this panel is to select a reagent type (a
functional group) and to identify the bond in the functional group that is
replaced when the reagent is added to the core. </p>

<p>The reagent preparation job attempts to identify the selected functional
group in each structure. Structures that match are then prepared using LigPrep.
The structure source does not therefore need to contain only structures that
have the desired functional group: structures that don't are filtered out.
Duplicates are <i>not</i> filtered out, however, so you should ensure that the
input file does not contain duplicates. The output file contains the prepared
reagents. There might be several output structures per input structure if the
molecule can exist in several low-energy forms. </p>

<p>You must run a reagent preparation job for each reagent type that will be
used in combinatorial screening or combinatorial library enumeration. </p>

<p><b>To set up and run a reagent preparation job:</b></p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Choose the source of reagent structures</p>
<p>You can select structures from the Workspace, the Project Table, or from an
external file. The file must be in Maestro, SD, or SMILES format.
The structures can be 2D or 3D, and are converted to all-atom 3D structures
by the reagent preparation job. </p>
<p>If you selected an SD file, you can also specify the source of the reagent
titles. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the functional group</p>
<p>The icons in the center of the panel define the functional group and the
point at which the bond is to be broken when the reagent is added to the core.
Click on the button that corresponds to the desired combination of a functional
group and a bond to break. The selection is displayed below the scrolling region.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select 2D-to-3D conversion and structure variation options</p>
<p>During the preparation process, you can choose to vary features of the
input structures: the ionization state, the stereochemistry, the
tautomerization, and the conformation of rings. The grow bond is <i>not</i>
altered in any way during structural variation. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Job Settings</span> from the <span
class="GUI">Settings</span> button menu,</p>
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/settings.png" />
<p>set the job parameters in the <span class="GUI">Job Settings</span> dialog
box, and click <span class="GUI">Save and Run</span> to run the job.
</p></li>

<a name="feature2"></a>
<h3>Functional group section</h3>

<p>The available functional groups are displayed in the center of the
panel, in a scrolling pane. The icon for each functional group marks the bond
that is broken to attach the reagent to the core with a red line across the
bond. The part of the reagent that is discarded is shown in red.</p>

<p>To select a functional group, click on an icon. The  &quot;short name&quot;
and the &quot;long name&quot; of the selected functional group are displayed
below the icon area. Both names consist of a part that identifies the type of
compound (acid chloride, primary amine, and so on) and a part that identifies
the bond that is broken, separated by an underscore The part that identifies the
bond consists of two atom names separated by an underscore. For example,
Acid_Chloride_C_C is the long name for acid chlorides in which the carbon-carbon
bond of the acid chloride group is broken.</p>

<p>A single class of compounds can have multiple icons, corresponding to
different bonds that are broken. You should make sure that you have selected
the icon with the bond to be broken that is the most appropriate for your
molecular system.
</p>

<p>The chosen functional group might be matched multiple times in a reagent
molecule, and a decision must be made about how to handle these occurrences of
the functional group. Three choices are offered on the <span
class="GUI">Treatment of multiple occurrences</span> option menu:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Produce all variants</span>&mdash;Prepare the reagent
molecule by annotating each occurrence of the functional group as a separate
structure. The title of the input structure has the text
&quot;,match-<i>n</i>&quot; appended, where <span class="GUI">n</span> indexes
the occurrences of the functional group in the order found.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Ignore the molecule</span>&mdash;Discard the reagent
molecule. This choice produces a reagent file in which there is only one
occurrence of the functional group in each structure.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Produce a structure only if all are
equivalent</span>&mdash;If the occurrences of the functional group are all
equivalent (as for example the acid group in oxalic acid), annotate the
functional group for one of the occurrences, otherwise discard the
molecule.</p></li>
</ul>


<a name="feature3"></a>
<h3>LigPrep Options Section</h3>
<p>In this section you can specify options for LigPrep. These options are used
to vary the ionization state, tautomeric state, stereochemistry and ring
conformations, so that the appropriate forms are available.
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#feature3.0"><span class="GUI">Ionize, using
pH</span> option and text boxes</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature3.1"><span class="GUI">Generate
tautomers</span> option</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature3.2"><span class="GUI">Use Epik for ionization and
tautomerization</span> option</a></li>
<li><a href="#metal_binding"><span class="GUI">Include metal-binding states</span> option</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature3.3"><span class="GUI">Generate
stereoisomers</span> text box</a></li>

<dt><span class="GUI">Ionize, using pH</span> option and text boxes</dt>
<dd><p>Protonate or deprotonate the reagents to represent the actual form in water
in the given pH range. If deselected, the structure's initial ionization state
is retained.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature3.1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Generate tautomers</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Select this option to generate tautomers of the input structures. Ionized
structures might have a different tautomeric form from the un-ionized structures.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature3.2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Use Epik for ionization and tautomerization</span>
option</dt> 
<dd><p>Select this option to use Epik for ionization and tautomerization rather
than the ionizer and the tautomerizer. Epik produces superior results, but
requires a separate license. 
</p></dd>

<a name="metal_binding"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Include metal-binding states</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>When generating states with Epik, generate states that are suitable for
binding (ligating) to metals. Only available if you select <span class="GUI">Use
Epik for ionization and tautomerization</span>.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature3.3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Generate stereoisomers</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>Enter the number of stereoisomers to generate. If the input structures are
2D and have chiral centers but do not have chirality information, you should
ensure that the number specified covers the possible combinations.
