<p>The <span class="GUI">Delete Properties</span> panel can be used to delete
properties from the Project Table. The properties to be deleted must be selected
from the <span class="GUI">Properties</span> list, which is a standard 
<a href="../project_facility/property_selection.html">property selection</a>
tool that includes filtering by subset or by text matching. </p>

<p>Selection of properties can be done with the usual shift-click and
control-click actions in the list. You can also select properties with
the <span class="GUI">Select properties</span> buttons. </p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="GUI">All</span>&mdash;Select all the properties that are
shown in the list. Properties that are not shown are deselected. 
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">All Empty</span>&mdash;Select the properties for which
none of the entries have a value. All of the empty properties are selected,
including any that are not shown in the list. 
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">None</span>&mdash;Clear the selection of properties. 
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>When you are satisfied with your selection, click <span class="GUI">Delete
Selected Properties</span> to delete the properties. You can repeat the
selection and deletion as many times as you like.</p>

<p>You can also delete properties from the <span class="GUI">Property
Tree</span> panel, by right-clicking on a property and
choosing <span class="GUI">Delete Property</span>.
