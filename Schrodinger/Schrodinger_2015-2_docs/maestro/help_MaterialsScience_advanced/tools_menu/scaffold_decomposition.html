<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>This dialog box can be used to set up and run a job to decompose a set of
structures into its constituent scaffolds. 
</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Scaffold Decomposition Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Scaffold Decomposition</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Tools &rarr; Scaffold Decomposition</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
</ul>


<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Scaffold Decomposition Panel</h2> 


<p>The scaffold decomposition performs two tasks: detecting scaffolds in the
structures, and then for each scaffold, finding the structures that
contain the scaffold.
</p>
<p>The largest scaffold is obtained by removing all side chains from any ring
system in the structure. Subscaffolds are then identified by breaking all
possible combinations of links between ring systems, except for fused rings.</p>
<p> Fused rings are not decomposed into smaller scaffolds. However, if the
structure set contains a combination of fused ring systems and their subsystems
(such as benzimidazoles and imidazoles), you can select <span class="GUI">Allow
embedded matches</span> to identify the subsystems of a fused ring system as
scaffolds when matching scaffolds to structures, e.g. imidazoles as scaffolds
in a benzimidazole.

<a name="feature1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Analyze structures from</span> option and menu</dt>
<dd><p>Select this option to start a new scaffold decomposition job, and choose
the source of the structures to decompose into scaffolds. You can take
structures from the Project Table or a file.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Restore results from previous run </span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Select this option to read the results from a previous scaffold
decomposition job, and examine the results. 
</p></dd>

<a name="feature3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">File name</span> text box and <span
class="GUI">Browse</span> button</dt> 
<dd><p>If analyzing structures from a file or restoring results from a previous
run, enter the file name in the text box, or click <span
class="GUI">Browse</span> and navigate to the file.</p>
<p>For new scaffold decomposition jobs, the file must be a structure file in
Maestro, SD, CSV, or SMILES format. </p>
<p>When restoring results, the file must be named 
<i>jobname</i><code>_scaffolds.dat</code>, and there must be a corresponding
structure file that contains the structures used in the decomposition.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature4"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Wait for results</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>If this option is selected, the results of the decomposition are
displayed in the <a href="scaffold_decomposition_viewer.html"><span
class="GUI">Scaffold Decomposition of <i>jobname</i></span> panel</a> when the
job finishes. If you deselect this option, you can display the results by
selecting <span class="GUI">Restore results from previous run </span>,
specifying a results file, then clicking <span class="GUI">Restore</span>.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature5"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Allow embedded matches</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Allow subsystems of a fused ring system to be matched to scaffolds when
identifying structures that contain the set of scaffolds. This only applies to
matching, not to detection of scaffolds. If the subsystem of a fused ring system
does not exist independently in the set of structures, it is not detected as a
scaffold. For example, if the structure set contains imidazoles and
benzimidazoles, then the imidazole scaffold is identified in the benzimidazoles
when finding the structures that contain each scaffold. However, if the
structure set contains benzimidazoles but not imidazoles, imidazole is not
detected as a scaffold and is therefore not identified in the benzimidazoles.

<dt>Action button</dt>
<dd><p>The action button at the lower left chages according to the option chosen
at the top of the panel.
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Start</span>&mdash;If <span class="GUI">Analyze
structures from</span> is selected, this button is displayed, and you can use it
to start the scaffold decomposition job. It opens a <span
class="GUI">Start</span> dialog box, in which you can set job options and start
the job.
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Restore</span>&mdash;If <span class="GUI">Restore
results from previous run </span> is selected, this button is displayed, and you
can use it to read in the results from a previous run and display them in the 
 <span class="GUI">Scaffold Decomposition of <i>scaffold</i></span> panel.
