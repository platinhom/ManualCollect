<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Calculate high-spin and low-spin states of transition metal complexes,
exploring some or all of the possible states produced by Jaguar's transition
metal initial guess code. Calculations can also be done on organic molecules and
on complexes with more than one transition metal. 
</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Spin States Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Spin States</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Tasks &rarr; Spin States</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Applications &rarr; Materials Science &rarr; Spin States</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
</ul>


<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Spin States Panel</h2> 


<p>This panel enables you to generate spin states for transition metal
complexes. It is primarily intended for complexes with a single metal, where the
possible occupations of the d orbitals can be explored. You can search for the
ground state, a specific spin state, or all spin states, either for the default
initial guess of the orbital occupations, or for all occupations generated from
the open d shell.  
</p>
<p>It is also possible to generate spin states for organic molecules. In this
case, the unpaired electrons go into the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals
after the paired electrons have been assigned to orbitals. 
</p>
<p>For mononuclear transition metal complexes, you must assign formal charges to
the metal center and the ligands so that the ligands are represented as
closed-shell molecules. Assigning atomic formal charges helps Jaguar to
construct initial guesses for metal complexes that sample different arrangements
of electrons in the d orbitals of the metal center. The spin states facility was
designed to sample only the open-shell character of the d orbitals, and requires
the ligands to be closed shell. The formal charge on the entire complex is
ignored: only the atomic formal charges are taken into account. The charge on
the complex can of course be constructed from the atomic formal charges.</p>

<p>To prepare a complex with the correct charges, you can use the tools on the
<span class="GUI">Build</span> toolbar.
</p>


<p><b>To assign formal charges to a complex:</b></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Ensure that all metal-ligand bonds are of zero order.</p>
<p>You can use the <span class="GUI">Decrement bond order</span> button on the
<span class="GUI">Build</span> toolbar to do this. 
</p>
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/build_decrement_bond.png">
</li>
<li><p>Display formal charges on the atoms.</p>
<p>Choose <span class="GUI">Formal Charge</span> from the <span 
class="GUI">Label All</span> button menu on the <span class="GUI">Labels</span>
toolbar. Also ensure that <span class="GUI">Reapply when Workspace
Changes</span> is selected on the same button menu, so that the charge label is
updated as you change it.
</p>
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/labelatoms.png" />
</li>
<li><p>Set the formal charges on the ligand atoms and the metal atom.</p>
<p>You can use the <span class="GUI">Increment formal charge</span> and<span
class="GUI"> Decrement formal charge</span> buttons on the <span
class="GUI">Build</span> toolbar to do this.
</p>
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/build_increment_formal.png">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/build_decrement_formal.png">
<p>You should consider the bonding as ionic, and make the ligands negative and
the metal positive. For example, halogens should have a charge of &minus;1, and
the two nitrogens in a porphyrin that bond to the metal should have a charge of
&minus;1. The nitrosyl ligand would generally be treated as
NO<sup>&minus;</sup>, but may be treated as NO<sup>&plus;</sup> when studying
solvation effects. The overall charge of the complex is reported in the status
bar. 
</p>
</li>

</ol>
<p>These classical atomic formal charge and closed shell ligand assignments are
used simply to provide flexibility in the SCF initial guesses. They have no
relation to the final converged wave functions, which can have any distribution
of atomic charges and spins.

<dt><span class="GUI">Optimization</span> section</dt>
<dd><p>Select <span class="GUI">Minimize geometry</span> if you want to find the
geometry of each spin state. The energy differences between the states are then
the adiabatic excitation energies.  By default, only an energy calculation is
done, and the energy differences are the vertical excitation energies. If you
choose to minimize the geometry, you can also obtain vibrational frequencies by
selecting <span class="GUI">Calculate frequencies</span>. Each option you select
substantially increases the time taken for the job.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature6"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Solvent</span> section</dt>
<dd><p>Choose a solvent model from the <span class="GUI">Model</span> option
menu. The choices are <span class="GUI">None</span>, which requests a
calculation in vacuum, and <span class="GUI">PBF</span>, which uses the
Poisson-Boltzmann solver with a continuum solvent. If you select the latter
option, you can then choose the solvent from the <code>Solvent</code> option
menu.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature7"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Run type</span> section</dt>
<dd><p>Choose the states for which you want to perform calculations in this
section. The first option menu allows you to choose whether to do calculations
for just the selected spin state or all spin states, and for the default
initial guess of the d-orbital occupations, or all possible initial guesses.
If you are running the calculation on an organic molecule or a complex with more
than one transition metal, the initial guess options are not available. </p>

<p>If you choose to select the spin state, the <span class="GUI">State</span>
option menu is activated, and you can choose to optimize the low-spin state
(singlet or doublet) or the high spin state (triplet or quartet for organics or
systems with more than one metal, highest allowed spin state for single-metal
complexes). For octahedral complexes with a single 3d transition metal, a third
option, <span class="GUI">ground</span>, is available, which uses a spin
multiplicity value that has been predicted by a physical model to be that of the
ground electronic state. In the case of spin-crossover systems, choosing <span
class="GUI">ground</span> selects all of the relevant quasi-degenerate spin
multiplicities.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature8"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Extra sections</span> section</dt>
<dd><p>Specify extra sections for the Jaguar input file. You can add the text
for these sections in the text box. The <span class="GUI">Generate &amp;atomic
section</span> option adds an <b>atomic</b> section with formal charge
(<b>formal</b>) and multiplicity (<b>multip</b>) for the metal atom. 
You could, for example include <b>zvar</b> and <b>coord</b> sections to do a
coordinate scan. 
</p></dd>

<a name="feature9"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Additional keywords</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>Specify additional keywords for the <b>gen</b> section of the input
file. For example, adding <code>iplotspn=1</code> requests a spin-density
calculation.
