<h2>Opening the Optoelectronics Calculations Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Optoelectronics Calculations</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Tasks &rarr; Optoelectronics &rarr; Perform Calculations</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Applications &rarr; Materials Science &rarr; Optoelectronics &rarr; Perform Calculations</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Using the Optoelectronics Calculations Panel</h2> 


<p>One of the main intended uses of this panel is to screen a set of related
molecules for properties that are of importance in optoelectronics. For this
purpose, it is useful to generate the set of related molecule by varying a
functional group at a particular position on a reference molecule. This can be
done in the <span class="GUI"><span class="GUI">Interactive Enumeration</span>
panel, which you can open by clicking the Enumerate Structures</span>
button. You can also open this panel from <span class="GUI">Applications &rarr;
Materials Science</span>. Since the structures are optimized as part of the
procedure, any structural deficiencies in the enumeration should be removed when
the properties are calculated. The results can be used as the basis for a QSPR
model, or simply examined directly to locate structures that show improvements
in key properties. The <a href="optoelectronics_results.html"><span
class="GUI">Optoelectronics Results</span> panel</a> allows you to show scatter
plots of any two properties, and the <a
href="../jaguar/spectrum_plot.html"><span class="GUI">Spectrum Plot</span>
panel</a> allows you to plot multiple spectra for comparison.
</p>
<p>Although the chosen set of properties is fixed, you can customize the methods
used to calculate the properties, in the <span class="GUI">Advanced
Options</span> dialog box. The properties and the methods used to calculate them
are described in detail in the next section.
</p>
<p>A video on optoelectronics screening, which uses this panel, is available at
<a href="http://www.schrodinger.com/videos/optoelectronics_workflow_matsci/">http://www.schrodinger.com/videos/optoelectronics_workflow_matsci/</a>
(in Korean at <a href="http://www.schrodinger.com/videos/optoelectronics_workflow_matsci_kor/">http://www.schrodinger.com/videos/optoelectronics_workflow_matsci_kor/</a>).

<h2>Optoelectronics Properties</h2>

<p>This section describes the properties calculated and the methods used for the
calculation.
</p>

<p>All calculations begin with a gas phase optimization of the ground state,
neutral molecule. This calculation is only performed once and used for all
properties.  All successive calculations are run with the same method and basis
set. If calculations on the cation or anion are required for more than one
property, they are only calculated once. For the anion calculations, it may be
advisable to add diffuse functions to the basis set. 
</p>

<h3>Screening Calculations</h3>

<p>The <span class="GUI">Screening</span> calculation method is intended to
produce high quality results with a small basis set. This method uses the MIDI!
basis set (Jaguar basis MIDIX). Because this basis set lacks d functions on
carbon atoms, calculations generally run much faster with this basis set than
with more common basis sets such as 6-31G*.  Because d functions are included on
other heavy atoms including N, O and F, results are similar to 6-31G* in quality
and significantly improved over 3-21G(*).  However, MIDI! does not have coverage
for many elements in the periodic table, so by default the following algorithm
is used to assign the basis set for screening calculations so that they can be
run over most of the periodic table.  For any element for which MIDI! is not
defined, 6-31G* is used if it is defined for that element; if 6-31G* is not
defined for that element, LACV3P is used.  If the basis set for screening is
changed to any basis set other than MIDI! (basis=midix), this algorithm is not
applied.</p>


<h3>Oxidation and Reduction Potentials</h3>

<p>Two different methods can be used for oxidation and reduction potentials: a
Koopmans' approximation and an adiabatic method. The selection of the methods
can be made in the <span class="GUI">Advanced Options</span> dialog box.</p>

<p>For the Koopmans Approximation, the potential is calculated with the
following formula.</p>

<p>Potential = slope * Orbital_energy + intercept
</p>

<p>The value of Orbital_energy is taken to be the HOMO energy from the neutral
molecule for the oxidation potential, and the LUMO energy for the reduction
potential. The values of the slope and intercept were obtained by linear
regression against experimental oxidation and reduction potentials over a wide
range of OLED materials, including hole and electron transporting materials,
emitting materials, organics and organometallic complexes.  These values were
developed using B3LYP with the default basis set for screening calculations (see
<i>Screening Calculations</i> above) and are not directly applicable to other
methods and basis sets.</p>

<p>Koopmans' approximation only requires a single calculation on the neutral
molecule in the ground state. It is the default method for <span
class="GUI">Screening</span> calculations.  It is significantly faster and more
robust than the adiabatic method.  In addition, because it has been
parameterized to experimental data, it is likely to produce results that are as
good as or better than the adiabatic method.</p>

<p>The adiabatic potentials are calculated with the following formulae:</p>
<p>
Oxidation Potential = -(E_electrode + E_electron + E_ion - E_neutral)<br/>
Reduction Potential = -(E_electrode + E_ion - E_neutral - E_electron)
</p>
<p>This method requires calculations on the neutral species and the ions. The
ion geometries are optimized in the gas phase, just as for the neutral
molecule. Single-point calculations are performed with aqueous continuum
solvation (PBF) at the optimized gas-phase geometries. E_electron is taken as
-4.44 eV and E_electrode is the potential of the electrode chosen in the
<span class="GUI">Advanced Options</span> dialog box.
</p>
<p>It may be advisable to include diffuse functions in the basis set when
calculating reduction potentials with the adiabatic method.
</p>


<h3>Hole and Electron Reorganization Energies</h3>

<p>The reorganization energy is the difference between the energy required for
the neutral molecule to relax from the ion geometry to the neutral geometry and
the energy required for the ion to relax from the neutral geometry to the ion
geometry.</p>

<p>E_reorg = (E_opt_neutral &minus; E_vert_neutral) &minus; (E_opt_ion &minus; E_vert_ion)
</p>

<p>Geometry optimizations are performed on the neutral and the ionic species,
and single-point calculations for the neutral at the ion geometry
(E_vert_neutral) and the ion at the neutral geometry (E_vert_ion) are then
performed, all in the gas phase.</p>

<h3>Triplet Energy and Triplet Reorganization Energy</h3>

<p>The triplet energy property is the energy of the relaxed lowest triplet state
relative to the energy of the relaxed ground state. The formula used includes
corrections that can be parametrized:
</p>
<p>E_trip = slope * (E_triplet_state &minus; E_ground_state) + intercept
</p>
<p>The energy of the triplet state is calculated using unrestricted DFT (UDFT)
to optimize its geometry. The slope and intercept were parametrized for the
<span class="GUI">Screening</span> calculation method, using B3LYP and the
default screening basis set.
</p>
<p>The triplet reorganization energy is defined in a similar manner to the hole
and electron reorganization energies:</p>

<p>E_trip_reorg = (E_opt_ground &minus; E_vert_ground) &minus; (E_opt_triplet &minus;
E_vert_triplet)</p>

<p>Geometry optimizations are performed on the ground state and the triplet
state, and single-point calculations for the ground state at the triplet
geometry (E_vert_ground) and the triplet at the ground state geometry
(E_vert_triplet) are then performed, all in the gas phase.</p>

<h3>Absorption Spectrum</h3>

<p>The absorption spectrum is calculated from vertical excitation energies
computed with TD-DFT (<code>itddft=1</code>) in the Tamm-Dancoff approximation
(<code>itda=1</code> ) at the neutral molecule geometry. Five states are
calculated (<code>nroot=5</code>). The spectrum can be viewed by importing the
spectrum file (<i>jobname</i><code>_uvv.spm</code>) into the <span
class="GUI">Spectrum Plot</span> panel, accessible from <span
class="GUI">Applications &rarr; Jaguar &rarr; Plot Spectra</span>.</p>
<p>In addition, this calculation computes properties based on the full spectrum.
This full spectrum is obtained by line-broadening the computed transitions.  The
broadening is done by placing a Lorentzian curve centered on each transition.
Each curve has a line width of 40 nm and a height equal to the oscillator
strength of the transition.  The sum of all curves is then taken to form the
full absorption spectrum.  The same method is used when plotting the spectrum on
the <span class="GUI">Spectrum Plot</span> panel.  From this full spectrum, the
following properties are computed.</p>

<ul>

<li><p><span class="GUI">Lmax</span>&mdash;The wavelength in the visible region
for which the spectrum has the highest intensity. This might not correspond to
the wavelength of the lowest energy transition because a) a higher energy
transition may have higher intensity, or b) two transitions may add together to
form a peak centered on neither transition.  Since 390 nm is considered the
short wavelength cutoff of the visible spectrum, an absorption spectrum with no
or only trivial peaks in the visible spectrum will typically show an Lmax value
of 390.</p></li>

<li><p><span class="GUI">Red Area/Green Area/Blue Area</span>&mdash; These are
the integrated areas under the absorption spectrum in the stated red, green or
blue region.  For the purposes of these properties, the region definitions are:
</p>
<p>
blue: 390-490<br/>
green: 490-590<br/>
red: 590-750</p>
<p>
These areas are useful in a relative comparison of the shifting absorption
window between structures. They can, for instance, offer a quick analysis of
which structure in a series has the most (or least) absorption in the green
region.  Since the spectra are scaled by the computed oscillator strength of the
transitions, a change in area can occur due to a change in intensity or a
shifting of the peak to shorter or longer wavelengths.</p>
</li></ul>

<h3>TADF S1-Tx gaps</h3>
<p>The energy gap between the lowest three triplet states (T1, T2, and T3) and
the first excited singlet state (S1) state is calculated using TDDFT, using the
S0 (ground) state as the reference. The gap can be calculated either at the
equilibrium geometry of the T1 state or the equilibrium geometry of the S0 state. 
This gap is useful for assessing the possibility of thermally-activated
delayed fluorescence.
