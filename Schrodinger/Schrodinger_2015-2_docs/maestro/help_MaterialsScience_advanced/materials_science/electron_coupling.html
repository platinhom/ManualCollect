<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Compute the charge transfer rate between molecules in a structure that
consists of multiple molecules (monomers). The structure could be generated from
a molecular dynamics simulation with Desmond, for example. Marcus theory is used
for the hopping rate, based on DFT calculations for the electron transfer
between donors and acceptors with either full wave function or dimer frontier
orbital splitting calculations of the coupling matrix element.

<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Tasks &rarr; Optoelectronics &rarr; Electron Coupling</span> 
in the main window.

<h2>Using the Electron Coupling Panel</h2> 


<p>This panel can be used to calculate carrier hopping rates in an
amorphous structure. It is mainly designed for the results of an MD simulation
with a homogeneous system, but it can be used for any structure consisting of
multiple molecules. To set up the structure with MD, you can use the <a
href="../materials_science/disordered_system_builder.html"><span
class="GUI">Disordered System Builder</span> panel</a> and then run a simulation
with the <a href="../desmond/molecular_dynamics_panel.html"><span
class="GUI">Molecular Dynamics</span> panel</a>. You can also import structures
from other sources into Maestro. The structures must consist of multiple
molecules. 
</p>

<p>As well as supplying the structures, you must also supply the reorganization
energy. You can calculate the reorganization energy with the  
<a href="optoelectronics_calculations.html">Optoelectronics Calculations</a>
panel. The reorganization energy is assumed to have been calculated for the
isolated, ground state relaxed molecule, and is assumed to be independent of the
geometry in the mixture. If you have a heterogeneous system, you must decide how
to treat the reorganization energy, which is specified here as a single value
and thus cannot be given for different components.
</p>

<p>The matrix elements for the hopping are calculated using QM wave functions
based on DFT calculations. The two alternatives are to run calculations on the
donor and acceptor in a pair independently, with the charge localized on one or
the other of the two, or to run calculations on the dimer and constrain the
charge to lie on either the donor or acceptor. The former is done with normal
DFT methods; the latter is done with constrained DFT (CDFT). All calculations
are run as single-point Jaguar calculations at the geometry of the input
structure. 
</p>

<p>There is a chance that a QM calculation can result in an excited state rather
than the ground state. CDFT calculations appear to be particularly susceptible
to this issue. Therefore, it is always important to check the HOMO and LUMO
values listed in the Project Table for the initial and final states to verify
that the HOMO energy is lower than the LUMO energy. If these values are
reversed, the calculation should be repeated, adding the setting
<code>vshift=0.0</code> in the <span class="GUI">Keywords</span>
text box. By default, the value is 0.2 for hybrid DFT functionals and 0.3 for
pure DFT. 
</p>

<p>When the job is run, each Jaguar job is run sequentially, but you can run
individual Jaguar jobs in parallel. Doing this is useful if the molecule or the
basis set is large. You cannot run CDFT (dimer) jobs in parallel, but you can
run dimer splitting jobs or DFT (monomer) jobs in parallel.
</p>

<p>The results of the calculation depend on the coupling method chosen. For each
dimer, a set of structures is produced. For the dimer frontier orbital splitting
method, the structural output consists of a dimer structure, and includes
properties for the hopping rate and the coupling matrix element (in eV), as well
as the Jaguar properties for the neutral dimer. For the full wave function
treatment, the output includes two dimer structures in addition to the DFT or
CDFT structures. The dimer structures have the rate properties, one for the
forward rate and one for the reverse rate. The properties are the charge
transfer coupling (T_i->f in the Jaguar output) and the hopping rate. If you
choose to calculate both hole and electron rates, there is one set of structures
for each carrier type.
</p>

<p>The hopping rate is defined by
</p>
<p>
K = (2&pi;/&hbar;) e<sup>&minus;L/(4kT)</sup> (H<sub>ab</sub>)<sup>2</sup>/&radic;(4&pi;LkT) 
</p>
<p>where L is the reorganization energy, H<sub>ab</sub> is the electron transfer
coupling matrix element, k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature,
and all energies are given in joules. The rate is in units of s<sup>&minus;1</sup>.
