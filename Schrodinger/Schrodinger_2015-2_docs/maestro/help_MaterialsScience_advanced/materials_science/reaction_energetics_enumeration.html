<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Calculate reaction barriers or reaction enthalpies for a series of related
compounds, based on a prototype unimolecular rearrangement reaction. The
structures for the reactions are enumerated by addition of functional groups to
the structures for the prototype reaction. 
</p>

<h2>Opening the Reaction Energetics Enumeration Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Reaction Energetics Enumeration</span> panel, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Tasks &rarr; Reaction Energetics Enumeration</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Applications &rarr; Materials Science &rarr; Reaction Energetics Enumeration</span> 
in the main window.
</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Using the Reaction Energetics Enumeration Panel</h2> 


<p>This panel allows you to evaluate either the reaction barrier or the reaction
enthlapy for a series of related unimolecular reactions. The reactions must be
based on a prototype reaction, in which substitutions are made on the structures
in the prototype reaction. For useful results, the reaction pathway and products
should not depend very much on the substituents: the transition states and the
products must have similar geometries to those of the prototype structures for
the common atoms. 
</p>
<p>Prior to using this panel, you should optimize the geometry of the prototype
reactant molecule, and do a transition state search or optimize the prototype
product geometry. All three structures must be unimolecular: reactant,
transition state, and product. The geometries of these structures are held fixed
during the remainder of the calculations. When the structures are enumerated,
the geometry of the additional functional groups is optimized in each structure
before the energies are calculated. </p>

<p>The atom numbering in the prototype reactant and the prototype transition
state or product must be the same. This is necessary because the attachment
points for the substituents must be on the corresponding atoms in these
structures. For a transition state, the atom numbering must be the same as that
of the reactant used in the search. For a product that is not used in a
transition state search, the numbering is not required to be the same, so you
must make sure that it is. One way to do this is to build the product from the
reactant in the Workspace with the build tools, breaking and forming bonds
<i>without deleting any atoms</i>. To ensure that no automatic deletion of
hydrogens is done, deselect <span class="GUI">Adjust number of hydrogens
following additive build operations</span> under <span class="GUI">Builder
&ndash; Behavior</span> in the <a
href="../maestro_menu/preferences.html#builder_behavior"><span
class="GUI">Preferences</span> panel</a>.
</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Choose the type of calculation.</p>
<p>The choices are <span class="GUI">Reaction barrier</span> or <span
class="GUI">Reaction enthalpy</span>. The choice determines whether you need a
transition state structure or a product structure in the second enumeration.
</p></li>
<li><p>Enumerate the reactant structures. </p>
<p>When you click <span class="GUI">Enumerate Reactant</span>, the <a
href="interactive_enumeration.html"><span class="GUI">Interactive
Enumeration</span> panel</a> opens. In this panel you should import the reactant
structure that you optimized, specify the bonds at which you want to substitute
other functional groups, and define the set of functional groups to
substitute. The structures are enumerated combinatorially when you click <span
class="GUI">Enumerate</span>: all possible substitutions are made, to create a
combinatorial library. This set of structures is used for the reactants.
</p></li>
<li><p>Enumerate the transition state structures or the product structures.</p>
<p>First choose the source of the structure from the <span
class="GUI">Structure</span> option menu. If you choose <span
class="GUI">File</span>, click <span class="GUI">Import</span> to import the
structure, which is then added to the project. When you click <span
class="GUI">Enumerate Transition State</span> or <span class="GUI">Enumerate
Product</span>, the same sets of functional groups that you chose for the
reactant are added to the same bonds in the transition state or the product, to
create a combinatorial library.
</p></li>
<li><p>(Optional) Pick atoms to freeze during geometry optimization.</p>
<p>Select <span class="GUI">Pick in Workspace to select atoms to freeze during
optimization</span>. The prototype reactant structure is placed in the
Workspace, and you can pick the atoms to freeze. These atoms are marked in the
Workspace and listed in the <span class="GUI">Frozen atoms</span> text box. If
you want to clear the frozen atom list, click the X button in this text box. The
atoms are frozen in all reactant and product structures. This feature is only
available for reaction enthalpies.
</p></li>
<li><p>Run the job.</p>
<p>When the reactant and transition state or product structures have been
enumerated, you can start the calculation. Choose a calculation quality, and
make any keyword settings that you want to add. Before you click <span
class="GUI">Run</span> to run the job, click the <span
class="GUI">Settings</span> button (gear icon) to make settings for the job. You
can distribute the job over multiple processors to reduce the turnaround time,
as well as selecting a host on which to run the job. For each structure, a
partial geometry optimization is run, so the calculations can take some time. 
</p></li>

</ol>
<p>When the job finishes, the reactant structures and either the transition state
structures or the product structures are added to the Project Table, if you
chose the output option to append new entries in the job settings dialog box.
The reaction enthalpy or the reaction barrier in kcal/mol is added to the
reactant structures as a property.
