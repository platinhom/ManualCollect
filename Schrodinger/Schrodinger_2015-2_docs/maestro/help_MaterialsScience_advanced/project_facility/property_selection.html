<p>Property selection tools are available in a number of panels, and also in
dialog boxes whose purpose is to choose properties (usually named <span
class="GUI">Choose Property</span>). There are two sets of property selection
tools: one for selecting a single property, and one for selecting multiple
properties.
</p>

<p>For both single and multiple property selection, there is a 
<span class="GUI">Subset</span> option menu and a <span
class="GUI">Filter</span> text box below the list of properties. 
For single property selection, you simply choose a property from the list.
For multiple property selection, you choose multiple properties from the
available properties list and transfer them to the list of properties to which
the designated action will be applied. 
</p>

<p>The tools are described in some more detail below.
</p>

<dl>

<dt>Property list (single selection)</dt>
<dd><p>List of properties for selection for the designated action. The
list can be restricted by using the <span class="GUI">Subset</span> option menu
or by filtering, or both. You can select a single item in this list.</p></dd>

<dt>Available properties list (multiple selection)</dt>
<dd><p>List of properties that are available for the desired action. The
list can be restricted by using the <span class="GUI">Subset</span> option menu
or by filtering, or both. You can select items with click, shift-click and
control-click. You can select all items with <span class="Keys">Ctrl+A</span> (<span class="Keys">&#x2318;A</span>).
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Subset</span> option menu</dt>
<dd><p>Restricts the range of properties shown in the <span
class="GUI">Available properties</span> list for multiple property selection, or
the property list for single property selection, to those belonging to the
chosen subset. This option menu lists the defined property families and two
other items, <span class="GUI">All properties</span>, and <span class="GUI">
Properties shown in Project Table</span>. 
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Filter</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>Filter the contents of the <span class="GUI">Available properties</span>
list so that only the items that match the expression in the text box are
displayed. You can use the wildcard characters <code>*</code> for zero or more
characters and <code>?</code> for a single character, and square brackets to
enclose a range of characters. The filtering is done as soon as you type in the
text box. To remove the filter, clear the text box. 
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Sort</span> option menu</dt>
<dd><p>Sort the property list according to the option selected from the menu:
<span class="GUI">Alphabetically</span> or <span class="GUI">By project table
order</span>.
</p></dd>

<dt>Arrow buttons (multiple selection)</dt>
<dd><p>These buttons are used to transfer properties between the source list
(available properties) and the destination list (properties for action). The
upper button (pointing right) moves the properties that are selected in the
source list to the destination list; the lower button (pointing left) moves the
properties that are selected in the destination list to the source list. You can
also use the left and right arrow keys to transfer the properties between the
lists. 
</p></dd>

<dt>Properties for action list (multiple selection)</dt>
<dd><p>List of properties to which the designated action will be applied. You
can select items with click, shift-click, and control-click. You can select all
items with <span class="Keys">Ctrl+A</span> (<span class="Keys">&#x2318;A</span>).
