        <p>Display information on protein-ligand interactions derived from a simulation, in graphical form. The diagrams show RMSD and RMSF measures for proteins, including backbone, side-chain, and secondary structure changes; ligands, including internal and external motions; and protein-ligand contacts, including H-bonds, hydrophobic, ionic, and water-bridge contacts.</p>
        <p class="opening">To open this panel, choose <span class="GUI">Tasks → Classical Simulation → Molecular Dynamics → Simulation Interactions Diagram</span> in the Task Tool.</p>
        <h2><a name="using"></a>Using the Simulation Interactions Diagram Panel</h2>
        <p>The purpose of this panel is to display graphically information about the behavior and interactions of proteins and ligands during the course of a simulation. For example, you can examine to what extent a hydrogen bond between a ligand and a protein residue is maintained during the simulation, whether the ligand moves in and out of the binding site, what are the more rigid regions of the protein and what are the flexible regions, how well is a water bridge maintained, how flexible the ligand is in the binding site. This information could be used to validate a ligand pose, or propose modifications to the ligand or to the protein.</p>
        <p>To generate the analysis data, you can click the <span class="GUI">Load</span> button and select an output <code>-out.cms</code> file that has an associated trajectory, and run the analysis. Once the analysis is run, you can load the event analysis file (<code>.eaf</code>) and examine the various graphical representations of the RMSD, RMSF, contacts, and torsions.</p>
        <p>You can create a PDF file that contains all the charts in the panel, along with explanatory text, or you can export just the charts as images. You can also export the data to a plain text file if you want to do your own analyses or processing of the data.</p>

        <p>Load the results of an analysis of the simulation interactions, from an event analysis file (<code>.eaf</code>), or load a simulation that has a trajectory (<code>-out.cms</code> file) and run the analysis. When you load a simulation, the <span class="GUI">SID Analysis Setup</span> dialog box opens, in which you can specify ASL expressions that define the protein and the ligand, and select the analysis types that you want to run.

There are four choices, <span class="GUI">C-alphas</span>, <span class="GUI">Backbone</span>, <span class="GUI">Side chains</span>, and <span class="GUI">Heavy atoms</span>. The superposition is done for the chosen atom set, except that the backbone is used for superposition for side-chain measurements. Each RMSD is plotted in a different color, shown in the legend.</p>
                <p>If the simulation has equilibrated, the protein RMSD should be fluctuating around some thermal average, by around 1-3 Å. If the RMSD is still increasing or decreasing, the simulation has not equilibrated, and the simulation may not be long enough for rigorous analysis. Large changes in the protein RMSD may indicate conformational changes.</p>

For <span class="GUI">Aligned on ligand</span>, the RMSD measures the internal fluctuations of the ligand. A large change may indicate a ligand conformational change. For <span class="GUI">Aligned on protein</span>, the RMSD measures the fluctuations of the ligand with respect to the protein.

        <h3><a name="feature4"></a>P-RMSF tab</h3>
        <p>This tab displays root-mean-square fluctuations (RMSF) for each residue in the protein chain. The RMSF for the residues is the time-averaged fluctuation of the square deviation of a designated set of residue atoms over the entire simulation time, after superposition on the reference frame. Peaks indicate areas of the protein that fluctuate most. These usually include the termini. Helices or strands usually fluctuate less.</p>

                <p>The polar plots show the conformation of the ligand as a function of time, where the radial coordinate is the simulation time, and the angular coordinate the torsional angle. The bar charts show the probability of the torsions as a function of angle. They represent the average over the simulation time. If the torsional potential information is available, this is plotted on the bar charts. The color of the plot matches the color coding of the rotatable bond on the ligand structure.</p>
                <p>These plots give information on the conformational stability of the ligand, and with the torsional potential, give information on possible ligand strain in the protein-bound conformation.</p>

        <h3><a name="LProperties"></a>L-Properties tab</h3>
        <p>This tab shows plots and bar charts of six ligand properties: polar surface area (PSA), solvent-accessible surface area (SASA), molecular surface area (MolSA), intramolecular hydrogen bonds (intraHB), radius of gyration (rGyr), and ligand RMSD with respect to the initial conformation (the same as in the PL-RMSD tab). For each property there is a chart that shows the value of the property as a function of time; to the right there is a bar chart that shows the proportion of time spent in each of 10 value ranges, divided equally over the range of property values.</p>
