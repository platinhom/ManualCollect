        <h1>FEP Ligand Mutation Tutorial</h1>
        <p>In this tutorial, you will set up an FEP calculation in which a ligand molecule is transformed by addition of a functional group, in the presence of a receptor. The receptor is an engineered version of the protein lysozyme containing an artificial non-polar cavity. The ligand is benzene, and it is transformed to ethyl benzene, to determine if ethyl benzene is a better ligand than benzene. This is a system where ligand docking calculations often fail, since the complexes fall outside the narrow range of typical drug-like molecules binding to common targets that their scoring functions are trained on. The system represents a rather small receptor and a simple ligand, chosen to make the tutorial simple and relatively fast.</p>
        <h3>Preparing the Receptor and Ligand</h3>
        <p>The structure of the ligand-receptor complex is taken from the PDB. X-ray structures usually need preparation for modeling, to assign bonds, add hydrogens, remove unwanted molecules, optimize the hydrogen bonding, and preminimize the structure. This is done in the <a href="../protein_prep_help/protein_preparation.html"><span class="GUI">Protein Preparation Wizard</span> panel</a>.</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>Click <span class="GUI">Protein Preparation Wizard</span> on the <span class="GUI">Favorites</span> toolbar.</p>
                <p>The <span class="GUI">Protein Preparation Wizard</span> panel opens.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>In the PDB text box, type <code>181L</code> and press <span class="Keys">Enter</span>.</p>
                <p>The structure of 181L is imported from the PDB and displayed in the Workspace. It is colored by the PDB conversion status, which can indicate problems in the structure. The orange molecules are het groups (nonstandard residues).</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>In the <span class="GUI">Delete waters beyond</span> text box, enter <code>0</code>.</p>
                <p>All waters are removed, as the system will be solvated later in preparation for the MD simulations. Water does not play a role in binding here. If it does, you may want to keep structural waters.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p>Click <span class="GUI">Preprocess</span>.</p>
                <p>The stages of the preprocessing are reported in the status area at the bottom of the panel as they occur. If any problems are found, a dialog box opens reporting on these problems. No problems should be reported for this structure.</p>
                <p>When the preprocessing is complete, a new structure is displayed in the Workspace, colored by element, with green carbons for the het groups.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="5">
                <p>Click the <span class="GUI">Review and Modify</span> tab.</p>
                <p>This tab shows the chains, waters, and het groups, and gives you an opportunity to delete any unwanted groups.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="6">
                <p>Select all except the A:BNZ het group in the table.</p>
                <p>The Workspace view zooms to the het groups as you select them. You can disable the zooming by deselecting <span class="GUI">Fit on select</span>.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="7">
                <p>Click <span class="GUI">Delete</span> (above the tables).</p>
                <p>The view zooms out to show the entire structure. The only molecules left are the protein and the benzene.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="8">
                <p>Click the <span class="GUI">Refine</span> tab.</p>
                <p>This tab provides tools to refine the protein structure.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="9">
                <p>In the <span class="GUI">H-bond assignment</span> section, click <span class="GUI">Optimize</span>.</p>
                <p>The optimization takes several seconds, and is reported in the status area. The protein is labeled with the results of the optimization, which include flips of terminal amides, neutralization of GLU108, and tautomerization of a histidine.</p>
                <p>If you want to review and change any of these settings, click <span class="GUI">Interactive Optimizer</span>. To remove the labels, click the <span class="GUI">Annotations</span> button on the <span class="GUI">Configuration</span> toolbar.
<br class="image" /><img src="../Resources/Images/Toolbuttons/delete.png" /><br class="image" /></p>
            </li>
            <li value="10">
                <p>In the <span class="GUI">Restrained minimization</span> section, click <span class="GUI">Minimize</span>.</p>
                <p>When the minimization is done, a new structure is added to the Project Table and displayed in the Workspace.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Setting Up the Workspace View</h3>
        <p>Before setting up the calculation, you will need to orient the ligand and zoom in so you can identify the bond that is to be transformed.</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>Click the <span class="GUI">Style</span> button, then click <span class="GUI">Ribbons</span>.<br class="image" /><img src="../Resources/Images/Toolbuttons/ribbon.png" /><br class="image" /></p>
                <p>Ribbons are displayed for the residues.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>Choose <span class="GUI">Workspace → Appearance</span>.</p>
                <p>The <span class="GUI">Appearance</span> panel opens.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>In the <span class="GUI">Fog</span> tab, for <span class="GUI">Display fog</span>, choose <span class="GUI">Off</span>. </p>
                <p>The fogging effect (depth perception) is turned off, and you can see all the ribbons clearly.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p>Choose <span class="GUI">Molecules</span> from the <span class="GUI">Ball &amp; Stick</span> button menu on the <span class="GUI">Representation</span> toolbar <br class="image" /><img src="../Resources/Images/Toolbuttons/ballnstick.png" /><br class="image" /> and click on the ligand molecule.</p>
                <p>The ligand is displayed in ball-and-stick representation.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="5">
                <p>Right-click on a ligand atom, then zoom in to show only the parts of the ribbon that are blue and green.</p>
                <p>Right-clicking on an atom places it at the center of the Workspace, and also sets the axes for rotation.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="6">
                <p>Rotate the view (middle mouse) until the view looks like the figure below.</p>
                <p>Note the position of the benzene over the blue-green loop with the bright green helix to the right, and the phenyl ring to the upper right.</p>
            </li>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/desmond/181l_ligand_bond.png" />
        </ol>
        <h3>Setting Up the Ligand Transformation</h3>
        <p>Now that the view is oriented, the ligand transformation can be set up.</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>Choose <span class="GUI">Tasks → Free Energy Calculations → Ligand FEP</span>.</p>
                <p>The <a href="ligand_fep.html"><span class="GUI">Ligand FEP - Ligand Functional Group Mutation</span> panel</a> opens.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>Select <span class="GUI">Pick the attachment bond</span>, then pick the C-H bond on the benzene that is circled in the figure above. When you pick the bond, click near the H.</p>
                <p>This is the C4-H4 bond. You can see the atom names in the status bar below the Workspace if you pause the cursor over the atom.</p>
                <p>A green arrow appears on the bond (the "attachment" bond), pointing to the hydrogen. The hydrogen will be replaced in the FEP calculation. The table of fragments is now available for selection of the replacement group. If you clicked closer to the C than the H, the arrow points in the wrong direction, and you should click again, closer to the H.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>Select the <span class="GUI">ethyl</span> row in the table (the second row).</p>
                <p>The hydrogen is replaced by an ethyl group in the Workspace, drawn as lines (wire frame). We will adjust the orientation of this ethyl group.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p>Choose <span class="GUI">Dihedral</span> from the <span class="GUI">Adjust</span> button menu on the <span class="GUI">Edit</span> toolbar.
<br class="image" /><img src="../Resources/Images/Toolbuttons/adjust.png" /><br class="image" /></p>
            </li>
            <li value="5">
                <p>In the Workspace, pick the following atoms in order: C3 (below the attachment C), C4 (the attachment carbon), the first ethyl C, then the second ethyl C.</p>
                <p>As you pick, markers are placed on the atoms. When you pick the last atom, an arrow is placed on the attachment bond, and the dihedral angle is shown next to the arrow.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="6">
                <p>Adjust the dihedral angle (either by dragging or with the scroll wheel of the mouse) until it is approximately 90°.</p>
                <p>This minimizes clashes with the receptor, and should help the simulations to some extent, though the simulations should sample the conformational space effectively in any case. The structure is now close to that of cocrystallized ethyl benzene (1nhb).</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Setting Up the Calculation</h3>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>Click the <span class="GUI">Plan Calculation</span> tab.</p>
                <p>In this tab you can change some of the simulation options.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>Change the <span class="GUI">FEP protocol</span> to <span class="GUI">Desmond NVT</span> in both the <span class="GUI">In complex</span> section and the <span class="GUI">In pure solvent</span> section.</p>
                <p>Calculations in the NVT ensemble run significantly faster on GPU hardware than calculations in the NPT ensemble. Though the latter are closer to experimental conditions, the differences should be negligible unless the ligand changes substantially in size (and if it does, the change is not suitable for an FEP calculation).</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3" data-mc-conditions="Default.SciSol">
                <p>Ensure that the <span class="GUI">Force field</span> is set to <span class="GUI">OPLS3</span>.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="4" data-mc-conditions="Default.SciSol">
                <p>In the <span class="GUI">REST</span> tab, ensure that <span class="GUI">Use REST</span> is selected.</p>
                <p>The REST method performes enhanced sampling for the changing parts of the molecule.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Setting Up and Running the Job</h3>
        <p>FEP calculations involve running a number of "windows" along the path from the initial ligand to the final ligand, that represent steps in the perturbation. Usually there are 12 windows, each of which can be run separately. The master job takes care of running each subjob and accumulating the results. You can run the master job on your local workstation and submit the subjobs to a queue host that has multiple CPUs or GPUs, so that the subjobs can be run simultaneously, and each subjob can run in parallel.</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>Click the Job settings button.<br class="image" /><img src="../Resources/Images/Toolbuttons/settings.png" /><br class="image" />The <span class="GUI">Ligand Functional Group Mutation by FEP - Start</span> dialog box opens.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>Change the job name if you wish.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>For the master job, set the <span class="GUI">Maximum simultaneous subjobs</span> to 0.</p>
                <p>This value removes the limit on the number of subjobs, so all of the subjobs are submitted to the subjob host. However, if you have a limited number of CPUs on your host, you should set this value in conjunction with the number of processors per subjob so that you do not exceed your resource limits.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p>Choose a multiprocessor host or a GPU host for the subjobs from the <span class="GUI">Host</span> option menu in the <span class="GUI">Subjob</span> section.</p>
                <p>You should run the subjobs on a host with multiple CPUs or GPUs, so that the job runs in parallel. Otherwise the turnaround will be much longer.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="5">
                <p>If you chose a CPU host, set the number of processors per subjob in the <span class="GUI">Use</span> text box in the <span class="GUI">Subjob</span> section.</p>
                <p>You could for example set this to the number of cores on a node in your cluster. With no limit on the subjobs, the total number of cores used would be 12 times this number.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="6">
                <p>If you <MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="Default.SciSol">are using REST and </MadCap:conditionalText>chose a GPU host, set the number of GPUs in the <span class="GUI">Total</span> text box in the <span class="GUI">Subjob</span> section<MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="Default.SciSol">; if you are not using REST, set the number of GPUs</MadCap:conditionalText> to 1.</p>
                <p>FEP calculations do not parallelize well over GPUs<MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="Default.SciSol"> in general, but REST production runs do parallelize well across GPUs</MadCap:conditionalText>.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Once you have set up the job parameters, you can either start the job, or you can write out the input files and then start the job from the command line.</p>
        <p><b>Important!</b> This job may run for many hours, so you should not start the job from a laptop or any other machine that is likely to be disconnected from the network while the job is running. At best, when the job finishes and the machine is reconnected, the results will be immediately uploaded. As the results can be several GB this may be highly undesirable. At worst, the results might not be uploaded at all, and be lost. It is therefore recommended that you copy the input files to your compute machine (cluster, for example), run it there, and transfer the results back when it is convenient to you.</p>

                <p>The <span class="GUI">Ligand FEP - Ligand Functional Group Mutation by FEP - Job Settings</span> dialog box closes.</p>
            </li>

                <p>The job files are written to a subdirectory of the current directory, named with the job name, and with the job name as the base name for the files. Five files are written: an <code>.msj</code> file and a <span class="GUI">.mae</span> file for the transformation in the complex, another <code>.msj</code> file and <span class="GUI">.mae</span> file for the transformation in solvent, and a shell script, named <i>jobname</i><code>.sh</code>. The two simulations can be run independently.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">

            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Examining the Results</h3>
        <p>When the job finishes, you can copy the results back to your local machine, if you copied the results to a compute host. You should have the following files and directories in the subdirectory that contained the input files:</p>
        <p><i>jobname</i><tt>_solvent_multisim.log</tt>
            <br /><i>jobname</i><tt>_solvent-multisim_checkpoint</tt>
            <br /><i>jobname</i><tt>_solvent_9-out.tgz</tt>
            <br /><i>jobname</i><tt>_solvent_10-out.tgz</tt>
            <br /><i>jobname</i><tt>_lig-out.mae</tt>
            <br /><i>jobname</i><tt>_complex_multisim.log</tt>
            <br /><i>jobname</i><tt>_complex-multisim_checkpoint</tt>
            <br /><i>jobname</i><tt>_complex_9-out.tgz</tt>
            <br /><i>jobname</i><tt>_complex_10-out.tgz</tt>
            <br /><i>jobname</i><tt>_cmp-out.mae</tt>
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>If you don't see the <code>_9-out.tgz</code> and <code>_10-out.tgz</code> files but do see some with lower numbers in the name, it means that the job failed. You can restart the job that failed using the checkpoint file.</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>Import the two Maestro files (<code>-out.mae</code>) into Maestro.</p>
                <p>These files contain the final structures from the simulation: the full system and the components (protein, solvent, ligands).</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>Open the <span class="GUI">Project Table</span> panel, and examine the column labeled with <span class="GUI">dG</span>, which contains the ΔG values for each simulation.</p>
                <p>These are free energies for the "alchemical" transformation of benzene into ethyl benzene. The numbers should be similar to the following:</p>

                <p>Transforming benzene into ethyl benzene lowers the energy more in the complex than in the solvent, and hence the relative binding free energy is lowered:</p>
                <p>ΔΔG = ΔG(complex) − ΔG(solvent) = −0.17 kcal/mol.</p>
                <p>The experimental value is −0.49 kcal/mol. The errors given for the simulations represent the statistical error from the data analysis that yields the results, and does not include systematic errors. Agreement of the FEP results with experiment is often in the range of 0.5 kcal/mol.</p>
