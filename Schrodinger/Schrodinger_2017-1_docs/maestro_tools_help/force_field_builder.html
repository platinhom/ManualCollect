                <p>Customize torsions that are not explicitly included in the OPLS3 force field by fitting to quantum-mechanical calculations for a set of molecules.</p>
                <h2><a name="using"></a>Using the Force Field Builder Panel</h2>
                <p>This panel is designed to provide force-field parameters for torsions that are not explicitly represented in the force field. The set of molecules that is provided is analyzed to locate such torsions, and you can then run quantum-mechanical calculations on these molecules, which are fitted to obtain parameters for the torsions. By default, all torsions that are found are fitted simultaneously, but you can exclude selected torsions from the fit and refit the data.</p>
                <p>The torsional energies are calculated by performing coordinate scans with Jaguar, then fitting the resulting energy curves to produce new force-field parameters. These calculations can take a long time. They can be run on multiple processors to decrease the turnaround time.</p>
                <p><b>To generate custom force-field parameters:</b>
