        <h1 class="title">Protein Structure Alignment Panel</h1><a name="summary"></a>
        <p>Use this panel when you would like to bring two or more proteins into a common frame of reference by structurally aligning (superimposing) them.</p>
        <p>It is often difficult to superimpose protein structures. Reasons include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">low structural similarity</li>
            <li value="2">low (or no) sequence identity</li>
            <li value="3">a different number of residues</li>
            <li value="4">different sequence numbering</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This panel greatly facilitates the superimposition of protein structures with an algorithm that attempts to align secondary structure elements.</p>
        <h2><a name="using"></a>Using the Protein Structure Alignment Panel</h2>
        <p>Structure alignment operates on Project Table entries that have been included in the Workspace or are selected in the Project Table. Include in the Workspace or select two or more protein structures, open the <span class="GUI">Protein Structure Alignment</span> panel, and click <span class="GUI">Align</span> to start the alignment calculation. The structure that is used for the frame of reference is the one in the entry that is nearest the top of the Project Table (i.e has the lowest row number). To use a different protein's frame of reference, move the entry for that protein up in the Project Table so that it is above the other entries before starting the alignment job.</p>
        <p>By default, the alignment includes all residues. However, it is often useful to align a subset of residues that have greater similarity than the structures as a whole, or are more informative to compare. Because this program uses matching of secondary structure elements, the subset should have enough contiguous residues to include at least one helix or strand. Very small numbers of residues do not produce useful alignments.</p>
        <p>You might need to try different subsets to obtain the most useful alignment. You can use the picking controls, choose a predefined set of atoms from the selection button menu, or open the <span class="GUI">Atom Selection</span> dialog box (ASD) to specify subsets. In this dialog box you can select a range of residue numbers, specify portions of the residue sequence, or click <span class="GUI">Secondary Structure</span> in the list of options on the left to choose residues based on their location in <span class="GUI">Helix</span>, <span class="GUI">Strand</span>, or <span class="GUI">Loop</span> structures. It might also be helpful to display the sequence viewer with the secondary structure assignment, and pick residues in the sequence viewer.</p>
        <p>When the alignment calculation is complete, the structures are placed in the same frame of reference in the Workspace, and the results of the calculation are displayed in the <span class="GUI">Protein Structure Alignment Results</span> panel. The aligned residues are listed and an <span class="GUI">RMSD</span> and <span class="GUI">Alignment Score</span> are reported. The <span class="GUI">RMSD</span> is calculated based only on those residues that are considered to have been successfully aligned, and therefore does not represent an overall comparison of the structures. It is computed from the C-alpha atoms of the aligned residues.</p>
        <p>An Alignment Score lower than 0.6–0.7 indicates a good alignment. Alignment Scores greater than about 0.7–0.8, or a failure of the structural alignment calculation, indicates there is insufficient structural similarity for a meaningful alignment. For details on the algorithm, see the paper by Honig and Yang (<i>J. Mol. Biol.</i><b>2000</b>, <i>301</i>, 665).</p>
        <p>The RMSD and the alignment score are also added to the structures as Maestro properties, <span class="GUI">StructAlign RMSD</span> (<code>r_psp_StructAlign_RMSD</code>) and <span class="GUI">StructAlign Score</span> (<code>r_psp_StructAlign_Score</code>).</p>
