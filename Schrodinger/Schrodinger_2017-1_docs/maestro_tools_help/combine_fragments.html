        <h1 class="title">Combine Fragments Panel</h1><a name="summary"></a>
        <p>In this panel you can set up and run jobs that attach a set of pre-positioned fragments, either to each other or to a defined core-containing molecule.</p>
        <h2><a name="using"></a>Using the Combine Fragments Panel</h2>
        <p>The <span class="GUI">Combine Fragments</span> panel allows you to run a job to join fragments that are pre-positioned with respect to each other, for example by docking into a receptor site. The fragments can either be joined directly to each other ("direct joining") or they can be joined to defined core-containing molecules ("core linking").</p>
        <p>The fragments are joined by identifying bonds that can be formed between the fragments, or the fragment and the core-containing molecule. The bonds are identified by two criteria:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">The angle between the bond directions must be less than a threshold. The default is 15° This criterion ensures a proper rotational alignment of the fragments .</li>
            <li value="2">The distance between the atom that remains in one fragment and the atom that leaves in the other fragment must be less than a threshold (after adjustment of the bond lengths in each fragment to the ideal bond length for the new bond). The default is 1&#160;Å. This criterion ensures a proper translational alignment of the fragments.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The fragments can overlap, and both internal and peripheral (H and halogen) bonds can considered for breaking to form a bond with another fragment. However, if the distance between the fragment centroids is below a given (settable) threshold, the fragments are not joined: they are considered to occupy the same location in the receptor.</p>
        <p>The thresholds can be set in the <a href="combine_fragments_options.html"><span class="GUI">Combine Fragments - Advanced Options</span> dialog box</a>.</p>
        <p>Direct linking of fragments is done in several rounds. The first round attempts to join pairs of fragments. In the second round, the results of the first round are used as input, so that the results can be combinations of up to four fragments, and so on.</p>
        <p>For fragments that have no atoms that are close enough to create new bonds but are still not far apart, methylene linkers are included to assess whether a bond can be formed. One methlyene is added to each fragment; thus two fragments can be joined by at most two methylene linkers.</p>
        <p>In core linking, the fragments are joined in turn to each core molecule, but are not joined to each other, and no methylene linkers are included. A minimum and a maximum number of fragments to attach to each core can be set; the defaults are 2 and 4. The bonds considered for linking in the core molecule are all terminal bonds (carbon-hydrogen and carbon-halogen). Since there is potentially a large number of combinations, the fragments are randomly sampled in a number of trials, with no repetitions between trials. The number of trials can be set; the default is 20.</p>
        <p>Once the fragments are combined, the resultant structures are passed through a minimization in which all heavy atoms in the fragments are restrained with a restraint of 100&#160;kcal/mol. No restraints are placed on core molecules or linker atoms.</p>
