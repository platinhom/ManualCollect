        <h1 class="title">Clustering Based on Volume Overlap Panel</h1><a name="summary"></a>
        <p>In this panel, you can cluster structures based on their volume overlap, as calculated by the Phase utility <code>phase_volCalc</code>.</p>
        <h2><a name="using"></a>Using the Clustering Based on Volume Overlap Panel</h2>
        <p>This panel generates a matrix of volume scores for all input molecules. The volume score is the overlap volume of two molecules divided by the total volume occupied by the molecules. The use of the volume score rather than the volume overlap normalizes the volume similarity, so that the diagonal elements of the volume score matrix are 1, and the off-diagonal elements represent the fractional overlap.</p>
        <p>Once the matrix is generated, it is used to cluster the molecules using a hierarchical agglomerative clustering method. The output is a set of files for a chosen number of clusters or a specified merging cutoff distance, named <i>jobname</i><code>_</code><i>n</i><code>.mae</code>, where <i>n</i> is the cluster index.</p>
        <p>Volume overlaps are calculated by summing up the occupations of squares on a cubic grid. A cube is occupied if the center of the cube lies inside an atomic sphere. To be included in the volume overlap, each cube must be occupied by atoms from both molecules. The calculated volume is an integer multiple of the cube volume; as such it is not highly accurate (about 0.5% error) but is sufficient for the evaluation of volume overlaps.</p>
        <p>The volume score is the fraction of the total volume that is common to both molecules. The total volume is calculated by adding up the number of cubes that are occupied by either of the molecules. The volue score can be expressed by (A AND B)/(A OR B), where A and B represent the volume occupied by the two molecules. It is in fact the Tanimoto similarity for the volume.</p>
