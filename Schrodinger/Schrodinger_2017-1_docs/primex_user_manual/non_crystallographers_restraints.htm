        <h1 class="Title">Molecular Geometry, Restraints, and Hydrogen Atoms in PrimeX</h1>
        <p>Certain aspects of molecular geometry are more accurately known than can be obtained from protein crystal diffraction. Bond lengths, bond angles, group planarity and non-bonded contacts can be derived from small molecule crystal structures, which are typically known to a much higher resolution than protein structures. Similar information is also available from quantum mechanical calculations or from microwave spectroscopy. This geometric information is applied during the refinement of protein crystal structures as restraints on the relative positions of atoms. The benefit of using this information in refinement is that false minima far from the correct solution are avoided. Another way of looking at this use of geometric restraints is that they bring additional information to the fitting procedure to compensate for the lack of sufficient diffraction data.</p>
        <p>While this use of molecular geometry is easy to understand, the correct weighting of these two types of information during optimization is not always obvious. Protein geometry is usually quantified on the basis of energy terms while crystallographic results are in terms of electrons per Å<sup>3</sup>. A weight factor is required to set the two types of terms to similar levels. Many crystallographers choose the weight that produces the lowest R-free consistent with good geometry. Fortunately, the R-free varies very slowly with changes in the weight near the minimum, so that a change in the weighting by a factor of 2 is barely significant near the optimal weight. In practice, a constant weight of 1 in PrimeX is often an adequate choice. Most structures will require a weight between 5 and 0.05. (See <a class="TopicLink MCXref xref xrefTopicLink" href="reciprocal_space_general.htm#reciprocal_space_2081142045_743694" xrefformat="{paratext}">General Setup for Reciprocal-Space Refinement</a> for information on setting this weight.)</p>
        <p>In the resolution range of most protein crystal structures, no information about the position of hydrogen atoms is obtained from the diffraction experiments. Thus, crystallographic models of proteins usually do not contain coordinates for hydrogen atoms. Even if hydrogen coordinates can only be inferred indirectly from the positions of the other atoms, hydrogen positions are often needed for various calculations and for the interpretation of various chemical phenomena. Hydrogens may be added to protein crystal structures after the completion of refinement, but PrimeX operates with a different philosophy. Refinement of a protein model with hydrogens present helps assure that all of the atomic coordinates are consistent with the observed data and known chemical geometry standards. </p>
        <p>Geometric restraints leave their mark on crystallographic models. Of special concern are non-bonded interactions. All popular protein crystal structure refinement programs, except PrimeX, use relatively weak restraints to try to avoid unrealistic close approach of atoms in forming non-bonded contacts. In molecular mechanics, these close contacts are evaluated as high energy conformations that mask the contribution of other terms in energy calculations. Crystallographers are familiar with the chemical considerations that make these close non-bonded contacts improbable. However, they do not strictly restrain these interactions because of the concern that, if the restraints are expressed as their full extent, atoms may be locked in a false, local minimum and not move past one another during refinement of the structure. Some crystallographers also make the argument that since protein crystallography presents a time-averaged picture of the protein structure, the most highly populated positions for two atoms might be in close contact even though at any given instant, the atoms would never approach that close. PrimeX works with the philosophy that the same rigor should be applied to non-bonded interactions as other known geometric restraints. In practice, enforcement of plausible non-bonded contacts in PrimeX produces molecular models with equally good R and R-free as those with close contacts.</p>
