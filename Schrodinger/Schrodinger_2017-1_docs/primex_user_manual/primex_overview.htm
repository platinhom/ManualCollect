        <h1 class="Title">The PrimeX Process</h1>
        <p>PrimeX has two unique features that change the way that this program is employed in refining a molecular replacement crystal structure solution, as compared to other refinement programs. Although the workflow discussed here for PrimeX will seem familiar to protein crystallographers, the use of the OPLS force field and the availability of strong real-space refinement tools affect workflow in ways that deserve special mention.</p>
        <p>First, because PrimeX uses the all-atom OPLS force field throughout, hydrogens must be part of the refinement. Hydrogen atoms only participate in the calculation of geometric restraints, and not in X-ray calculations. An option in the <span class="GUI">Calculations Settings</span> dialog box determines whether a structure is returned from refinement with or without hydrogens, a choice to be made depending on whether you wish to explicitly refine hydrogen positions or not. Early in the refinement of a structure, you might wish to ignore hydrogens. In that case, hydrogen atoms are added to the structure in an intelligent manner when it is submitted for any type of refinement. After the refinement job finishes, the hydrogens are deleted so that their temporary presence is of no direct concern to the crystallographer. Late in a structure refinement, you might consider refining hydrogen positions over multiple cycles of refinement in order to focus on the details of hydrogen bonding or catalytic mechanism. In this situation, hydrogen coordinates are returned with the structure by selecting that option.</p>
        <p>Second, PrimeX depends on two real-space refinement tools, loop refinement and side-chain prediction. Loop refinement builds into an omit map loops of up to 40 residues in length, and tails (polypeptides anchored only at one end) of up to 20 residues in length. Side-chain prediction can fit multiple side chains into their electron density during a single application of this tool, so that side chains that might occupy the same volume of space in the model can be correctly placed in the electron density. </p>
        <p>The sample workflow presented here is representative of how you might proceed with the refinement of a molecular replacement solution using PrimeX. Any such workflow can be affected drastically by such factors as the high resolution limit of the data and the sequence identity between the starting model and the target sequence. This workflow is relatively simple compared to the possible complications that can develop during any given refinement.</p>
        <p>Starting with a molecular replacement solution obtained from other software, the first PrimeX operation is most likely to be rigid body refinement. Single or multiple groups may be defined according to the complexity of the contents of the asymmetric unit. Early rounds of refinement should normally apply anisotropic B-factor scaling. The mask method for bulk solvent correction is usually the best choice, although one might consider using the Babinet method while the boundary between protein and solvent is still especially uncertain. At these early stages of refinement, you can avoid having hydrogens returned with a refined structure by clearing the <span class="GUI">Include H-atoms in structure output</span> option in the <span class="GUI">Calculation Settings </span>dialog box. </p>
        <p>At some point in the workflow, the individual isotropic temperature factors from the original model should be reset to a constant value to help reduce the bias of the target toward the starting model. For simple molecular replacement solutions, this operation can occur in the <span class="GUI">Input Data </span>panel. This function is also available in the <span class="GUI">General</span> tab of the <span class="GUI">Reciprocal-Space Refinement</span> panel for use at any point in the workflow. Note that resetting B-factors is likely to raise the R-factors to the extent that they have some resemblance to the correct B-factors for the target. Difficult molecular replacement solutions may be made even more tenuous if B-factors are reset too soon. Refinement of individual B-factors is often left until the target structure is substantially complete with respect to the protein backbone. Initial B-factor refinement is usually highly restrained, and may be followed late in the refinement with less-highly restrained B-factor refinement. The appropriate course of action will depend strongly on the resolution of the structure, as well as other details of a particular refinement problem. </p>
        <p>Simulated annealing refinement is often helpful to lower the R-factors for a molecular replacement model at this stage, although use of this function may not be required where the starting model and target are already very similar. The approximate energy model in molecular dynamics refinement is intended to be used in this situation where faster results are more important than strict adherence to the most accurate energy model. Default values should be suitable for most situations.</p>
        <p>Point mutation differences between the starting model and the target sequence may be resolved at this time by using the <span class="GUI">Mutate Model to Sequence</span> tool, which replaces side chains in reasonable conformations without reference to the electron density. The <span class="GUI">Predict Side Chain</span> tool can fit multiple side chains to electron density in one job, and should immediately follow the mutation of one or more residues. Missing residues may be built into electron density with the correct sequence by using the <span class="GUI">Loop refinement</span> tool at this point or in later stages of the refinement. Both of these tools are available in the <span class="GUI">Real-Space Refinement</span> panel.</p>
        <p>Reciprocal-space minimization is frequently used to optimize changes made in the structure introduced by other methods such as side chain prediction. How and when these methods are applied very much depends on details of the structure determination, in ways that are beyond the scope of this software manual. The same good refinement practices that are to be used with other refinement packages also apply to PrimeX.</p>

        <p>Validation tools should help to pinpoint problem areas of the structure that are incorrect and need remedial action beyond what reciprocal-space refinement is able to accomplish. The validation tools available in PrimeX are a Density Fit table, the Protein Reports pages and a Ramachandran plot. The power of real-space loop refinement and side chain prediction make these functions the first choice for improving problematic stretches of residues. If those tools cannot resolve the observed issues, manual adjustment of the model in Maestro may be necessary.</p>
        <p>Once the model is substantially correct, one should begin to consider some of the more subtle issues in structure determination, such as the orientation of the His, Gln and Asn side chains in the context of hydrogen-bonding partners. The correct order of operations is to first select <span class="GUI">Include H-atoms in structure output</span> in the <span class="GUI">Calculation Settings</span> dialog box, if not already set, and then treat the structure with reciprocal-space minimization. At that point in the workflow, hydrogen bonding networks can be considered. The <span class="GUI">Optimize H-bond Networks </span>tool can automatically orient these side chains and all polar hydrogens for optimized hydrogen-bond interactions. You can also manually select and fix the orientation of any hydrogen bond or side chain. </p>
        <p>Ligand placement is best performed when the refinement of the binding site is as complete as possible, before the addition of solvent atoms or water. Once a ligand pose is chosen and refined, water addition can begin using the <span class="GUI">Water placement</span> tool.</p>
        <p>A final round of low-temperature simulated annealing may help position atoms, and especially hydrogens. Since hydrogen positions are influenced strongly by electrostatic interactions, the complete energy model should be used at this stage of the refinement. Final reciprocal-space minimization of the structure will help produce the best possible R-factors and a structure suitable for immediate use in various applications of computational chemistry.</p>
