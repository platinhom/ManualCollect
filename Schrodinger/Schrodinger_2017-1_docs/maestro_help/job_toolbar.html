        <h1>Job Toolbar</h1>
        <p>The Job toolbar is used to make settings for a job and to start it. This toolbar is customized for each panel. The features on the toolbar are listed below, with conditions on when the features are present noted.</p>
        <dl>
            <dt><span class="GUI">Job name</span> text box</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>Enter a name for the job in this text box.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt><span class="GUI">Settings</span> button menu</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>This button opens the <a href="job_settings.html"><span class="GUI">Job Settings</span> dialog box</a>. The arrow to the right opens a menu, from which you can make settings or perform actions that are related to the job.</p>
                <img src="../Resources/Images/Toolbuttons/settings.png" />
                <p>The menu items are described below. Many of these are custom items for particular panels.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li value="1">
                        <p><span class="GUI">Job Settings</span>—Make and save settings for the incorporation of the job into the Maestro project, the job name, the host, the distribution of subjobs, and any other application-specific job settings. Opens the <span class="GUI">Job Settings</span> dialog box.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li value="2"><span class="GUI">Preferences</span>—Set general preferences for running jobs. Opens the <span class="GUI">Preferences</span> panel at the <a href="preferences.html#jobs_starting"><span class="GUI">Jobs - Starting</span> section</a>.</li>
                    <li value="3">
                        <p><span class="GUI">Read</span>—Read an input file (configuration file for Desmond) and apply the settings in the file to the panel controls. Opens a file selector in which you can navigate to the desired input file.</p>
                        <p>For Jaguar panels, this item opens the <span class="GUI">Jaguar Read</span> file selector in which you can select a Jaguar input file to read. The settings in the input file are applied to the panel if you choose to read settings. Note that Maestro discards @, *, and # symbols when a Jaguar input file is read. This means that any counterpoise atoms, atoms for Hessian refinement, and constraints that were set in the input file are no longer set.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li value="4">
                        <p><span class="GUI">Write</span>—Write the input files for the job but do not start it. The file names are based on the current job name, and the files are written to a subdirectory of the current working directory that is named with the job name.</p>
                        <p>For Jaguar panels, this item opens the <span class="GUI">Jaguar Write</span> file selector in which you can write out the input file or a batch file.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li value="5">
                        <p><span class="GUI">Edit</span>—Opens the <a href="../jaguar_help/edit_job.html"><span class="GUI">Edit Job</span> dialog box</a>, in which you can edit the entire input file or just the geometry (structure). Jaguar only.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li value="6">
                        <p><span class="GUI">Reset Panel</span>—Reset the values in the panel to their defaults.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li value="7">
                        <p><span class="GUI">Export Map</span>—Export the FEP perturbation map to a map file. You can import this file into the <span class="GUI">FEP Mapper</span> panel later on. FEP+ only.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li value="8">
                        <p><span class="GUI">Export Map as PDF</span>—Export the FEP perturbation map image to a PDF file. FEP+ only.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li value="9">
                        <p><span class="GUI">Advanced Options</span>—Specify options for the FEP Selectivity MD simulation or FEP+ perturbation calculations. Opens the <span class="GUI">Advanced Options</span> dialog box, in which you can set the buffer size for the unit cell, set the simulation time and random seed, and choose the ensemble. FEP+ only.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </dd>
            <dt><span class="GUI">Job status</span> button</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>This icon indicates when there are jobs running for the application that belong to the current project. It starts spinning when the first job starts, and stops when there are no more jobs running. If a job fails to start, it changes to an exclamation point.</p>
                <img src="../Resources/Images/Toolbuttons/job_status.png" />
                <p>Clicking the button shows a small job status window that lists the job name and status for all active jobs submitted from the current panel (for Jaguar and MacroModel this means all jobs from any of the application panels). You can double-click on a row to open the <a href="monitor_panel.html"><span class="GUI">Monitor</span> panel</a> and monitor the job, or click the <span class="GUI">Monitor</span> button to open the <span class="GUI">Monitor</span> panel and close the job status window. The job status is updated while the window is open. If a job finishes while the window is open, the job remains displayed but with the new status. The rows are colored according to the status: yellow for submitted, green for launched, running, or finished, red for incorporated, died, or killed. Click anywhere outside the window to close it.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt><span class="GUI">Run</span> button</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>Run the job with the current job settings.</p>
            </dd>
