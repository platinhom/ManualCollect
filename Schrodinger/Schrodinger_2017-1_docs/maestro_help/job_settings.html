        <h1 class="title">Job Settings Dialog Box</h1><a name="summary"></a>
        <p>The <span class="GUI">Job Settings</span> dialog box is used to specify settings that are used when starting jobs from Maestro. Settings are stored for each application (with a few exceptions).</p>
        <h2><a name="features"></a>Job Settings Dialog Box Features</h2>
        <p>The features present in the <span class="GUI">Job Settings</span> dialog box depend on the calculation to be carried out. Each instance of this dialog box has a <span class="GUI">Job</span> section and a set of action buttons. If the job produces structural output and properties, the dialog box can also have an <span class="GUI">Output</span> section. Other, job-specific controls are made available as needed. The controls that are common to many instances of the <span class="GUI">Job Settings</span> dialog box are described below.</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1"><a href="#feature1"><span class="GUI">Output</span> section</a>
            </li>
            <li value="2"><a href="#feature2"><span class="GUI">Job</span> section</a>
            </li>
            <li value="3"><a href="#feature3">Action buttons</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3><a name="feature1"></a>Output section</h3>
        <p>The <span class="GUI">Output</span> section, if present, contains an <span class="GUI">Incorporate</span> option menu for choosing the manner in which the structural and property results of the calculation are incorporated into the project. The menu can have one or more of the following options:</p>
        <dl>
            <dt><span class="GUI">Append new entries as a new group</span>
            </dt>
            <dd>
                <p>Each structure in the output file is added to the project as a new entry, and the entries are grouped. The group name is set to the name of the file from which the entries were read, minus the extension. This is the default option.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt><span class="GUI">Append new entries in place</span>
            </dt>
            <dd>
                <p>Each new entry is added to the project immediately below its source entry, i.e. the entry that was used as input for the job. If there is no source entry, the new entry is added to the end of the entry list in the project as an individual entry.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt><span class="GUI">Append new entries individually</span>
            </dt>
            <dd>
                <p>Each structure in the output file is added to the project as a new entry, but the entries are not grouped.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt><span class="GUI">Replace existing entries</span>
            </dt>
            <dd>
                <p>Any entries that served as input for the job are replaced with the new structures returned from the calculation.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt><span class="GUI">Do not incorporate</span>
            </dt>
            <dd>
                <p>No change is made to the project when the job is complete.</p>
            </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>The choice that you make from this menu is persistent for a given job type: the next time you run a job of that type, the incorporation mode that you last used is the default mode. The incorporation mode is stored as a preference by Maestro, so the choice persists across Maestro sessions.</p>
        <h3><a name="feature2"></a>Job section</h3>
        <p>Some of these controls may be absent for a given instance of the dialog box. Jobs that cannot be distributed usually only have a hosts option menu. Jobs that can be divided into a specified number of independent subjobs and distributed over multiple hosts have a text box for the number of subjobs, and a host list for the hosts. Jobs that can be run in parallel or can only be distributed on a single host have a host option menu and a CPUs text box. Jobs that can be run on GPUs have a GPGPU list as well as the host option menu.</p>
        <p>As terminology has changed with the introduction of multicore CPUs, in the descriptions below, both "processor" and "CPU" are taken to mean a single processing unit, such as a core.</p>

                <p>Enter a name for the job. Job names cannot contain spaces or nonprinting characters.</p>
                <p>When a job is started, a subdirectory of the working directory is created using the job name (depending on the application), for writing job files in. Job files are named with the job name as the first part (stem or prefix) of the file names.</p>
                <p>The initial name shown is a standard name for the application, which might include calculation settings. A standard name that contains settings is updated when the settings change. You can modify a standard name; if you do and it still retains some settings, the name is updated if the settings change. You can also replace the entire job name.</p>
                <p>When a standard name or modified standard name is used, the job name is made unique by appending an integer. This is done by checking for job directories or files in the current working directory. However, if you replace the job name to create a custom job name, the name might no longer be unique, and it is not automatically made unique. In that case, a warning is posted before any files are overwritten.</p>
                <p>After a job is submitted, a new job name is automatically created for the next job from the current job name, by appending an integer or incrementing the integer. This is done for custom job names as well as standard or modified names.</p>

            <dd>
                <p>The <span class="GUI">Host</span> menu displays all the hosts defined in the <tt>$SCHRODINGER/schrodinger.hosts</tt> file, with the number of CPUs available on the host in parentheses. To run the selected job on a remote host, choose the host from this menu.</p>
                <p>The host localhost means the host on which you are running Maestro. If you run a job locally, Maestro automatically reduces the priority of the job so that it does not compete with Maestro for resources. The exceptions are Hydrophobic/philic map jobs, and structure cleanup jobs. To change this behavior, set the <code>SCHRODINGER_NICE</code> environment variable (see <a href="../job_control/jobcontrol_envvar.htm" class="MCXref xref" xrefformat="{paratext}">Job Control Environment Variables</a>).</p>
                <p>If you want to submit a job from your laptop and then take the laptop offline, you can choose a host that supports running detached jobs. For more information on setting up this capability, see <a href="../install_guide/job_setup_offline.htm" class="MCXref xref" xrefformat="{paratext}">Configuring Offline Job Management</a>.</p>

            <dd>
                <p>Specify the number of processors to use to run the job. Absent if the job cannot be distributed or run in parallel. The number of processors actually used is limited by the number of licenses available for the type of job, and for some jobs might vary during the course of the job.</p>

            <dt><a name="feature2.3.5"></a><span class="GUI">Distribute subjobs across</span> options and text boxes</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>Choose an option for how to distribute the subjobs for parallel execution. These options apply to Jaguar and Quantum ESPRESSO jobs, which can use OMP threads for parallelization.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li value="1"><span class="GUI">CPUs</span>—Specify only the number of processors to use. The number of threads is determined automatically for some job types, while for others, the subjobs are distributed between the processors, one per processor.</li>
                    <li value="2"><span class="GUI">Threads and subjobs</span>—Specify the number of threads per process to use, and the number of subjobs to run simultaneously. The total number of processors requested is the product of these numbers, as each subjob runs with the specified number of threads. When this option is selected, text boxes for the numbers are displayed, and the total number of CPUs that result from the values in the text boxes is reported below.</li>

            <dd>
                <p>For jobs that can be distributed over multiple CPUs (and multiple hosts), specify the number of subjobs to split the job into. This number can be larger than the number of processors used, and it is often a good idea to choose a number that is several times the number of processors for optimal load balancing. The number of subjobs should not be smaller than the number of processors: if it is, it is reset to the total number of processors. See <a href="../quick_reference/distributed_jobs.htm">Running Distributed Schrödinger Jobs</a> for more information.  Some job drivers optimize the number of subjobs, so the number actually used might not be exactly the number given.</p>

                <p>The <span class="GUI">Host list</span> table is available for applications that can distribute jobs over multiple hosts. The table displays all the hosts defined in the <tt>$SCHRODINGER/schrodinger.hosts</tt> file, with the number of processors available on the host in the <span class="GUI">Processors</span> column. The <span class="GUI">Use</span> column specifies the number of processors to use from the given host. The default number is the number available, or * if it is a queue host. You can edit this column to set the number of processors, and you can reset the values to the default by clicking <span class="GUI">Reset All</span>.</p>
                <p>To specify the hosts, select the host rows in the table. To set the number of processors on the host, edit the values in the <span class="GUI">Use</span> column as needed. The total number of processors for the job is reported in the <span class="GUI">Total to use</span> text box (which is noneditable).</p>
                <p>When you select hosts for the job, you can only select one queue host, and you cannot select both queue and non-queue hosts. If you select a queue host, all other table rows are deselected.</p>
                <p>To reset the <span class="GUI">Host list</span> table to the default values (use all processors on the local host), click <span class="GUI">Reset All</span>.</p>
