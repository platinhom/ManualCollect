        <h1 class="title">Build Single Complex Panel</h1><a name="summary"></a>
        <p>Build a single organometallic complex with a single metal center, in octahedral, tetrahedral, or square planar geometry.</p>
        <p class="opening">To open this panel, choose <span class="GUI">Tasks → Materials → Build → Single Complex</span> in the Task Tool.</p>
        <h2><a name="using"></a>Using the Build Single Complex Panel</h2>
        <p>There are three main steps to building an organometallic complex:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>Choose the metal and the coordination geometry.</p>
                <p>You can do this in the <span class="GUI">Complex information</span> section. Type in the atomic symbol for the metal, and choose the geometry from the <span class="GUI">Geometry</span> option menu.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>Choose the ligands.</p>
                <p>In this step, you decide how many different ligands you want to use, how many of each ligand to use, and select or sketch the ligands. Each ligand is represented by a row in the <span class="GUI">Ligands</span> section. Each row specifies the number of copies of the ligand, and has a button to assign a ligand structure to this row. For example, for an ML<sub>3</sub>X<sub>3</sub> complex, you would have two rows, one for ligand L and one for ligand X, and for each you would set the number of copies to 3. Rows can be added by clicking <span class="GUI">Add Ligand Row</span>.</p>
                <p>The actual structures can be defined in the <span class="GUI">Ligand sketcher</span> section, either by choosing a template for the ligand, which you can modify, or drawing the ligand structure in the sketcher. To draw a ligand, choose <span class="GUI">Custom</span> from the <span class="GUI">Template</span> option menu. When you have drawn or chosen a ligand, click <span class="GUI">Use Current Structure</span> on the row in the <span class="GUI">Ligands</span> section that you want to assign the structure to. The ligand formula and whether the ligand is monodentate or bidentate is shown in the ligand row. In addition, the number of occupied coordination sites listed above the ligand rows is updated.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>Choose the arrangement of ligands in the complex.</p>
                <p>For octahedral complexes with bidentate ligands, you can automatically arrange them in a facial or meridional conformation, by choosing the isomer in the <span class="GUI">Complex information</span> section. Both isomers are chiral, but only one of the stereoisomers is built. The facial stereoisomer is in the Λ form, the meridional stereoisomer is in the Δ form. The geometry is applied when you save the structure. To convert to the other stereoisomer, display the <span class="GUI">Build</span> toolbar, and double-click the <span class="GUI">R/S</span> button. (If the ligand is symmetric, there are only the two stereoisomers.)</p>
                <p>For tetrahedral complexes with two pairs of monodentate ligands, you can choose either the cis or the trans isomer in the <span class="GUI">Complex information</span> section.</p>
                <p>For any other type of complex, you must pick the sites on the metal atom for each ligating atom on each ligand, by clicking <span class="GUI">Specify Ligand Coordination Sites</span> and using the diagram of the complex in the dialog box that opens to pick the sites for each ligand.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>When you have finished defining the complex, click one of the action buttons to save it, either to the Maestro project with <span class="GUI">Create Project Entry</span> or to a file, with <span class="GUI">Write File</span>.</p>
        <p>If you want to create new ligand templates, choose <span class="GUI">Custom</span> from the <span class="GUI">Template</span> option menu, then draw the new ligand in the sketcher. You must indicate which atoms are the ligating atoms, by adding a bond to them and labeling the terminal atom as R<sub>1</sub> for the first ligating atom, and R<sub>2</sub> for the second. Right-click on the atom and choose <span class="GUI">Set R Group → R1</span> or <span class="GUI">R2</span> to perform the labeling. Click <span class="GUI">Save New Template</span> to save the ligand structure you drew, and name the structure in the dialog box that is displayed. The custom templates are stored in your <a href="../job_control/job_control_glossary.htm#user_resources_directory">Schrödinger user resources directory</a>.</p>
        <p>When you have built the complex, you should consider cleaning it up with the <a href="ligand_cleanup.html"><span class="GUI">Ligand Cleanup</span> panel</a>, and then running a geometry optimization with Jaguar before proceeding with any calculations on the complex.</p>

                <p>If you choose <span class="GUI">Custom</span>, you can draw your own ligand in the sketcher. When you have created your ligand, you must draw in a bond from the ligating atom or atoms to a potential metal atom, and label the terminal atom on the bond with <span class="GUI">R1</span>, or <span class="GUI">R2</span> for the second ligating atom of a bidentate ligand. To label the atom, you can either pause the pointer over the atom and type in the label, or right-click on the atom and choose <span class="GUI">Set R Group → R1</span> (or <span class="GUI">R2</span>). The labeled terminal atom is replaced by the metal when the complex is constructed. If the ligand forms a dative bond, you must still add a bond and label it, even if it violates the valence of the ligating atom.</p>
