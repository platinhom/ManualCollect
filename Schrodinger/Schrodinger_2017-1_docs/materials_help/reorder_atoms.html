        <p>Reorder the atom numbers in a comparison structure to match the ordering in a reference structure either automatically or by manual selection on two diagrams or from two lists.</p>
        <h2><a name="using"></a>Using the Reorder Atoms Dialog Box</h2>
        <p>There are several ways in which you can use this dialog box to map the atoms of the comparison structure to those of the reference structure.</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>Use the automated detection (guess) tools. Select a guess method and click <span class="GUI">Guess</span>. The guessed atoms are marked in light blue. If the guess is good, click <span class="GUI">Accept Guess</span>; if not, click <span class="GUI">Reject Guess</span>. The atoms are marked in green if the guess is accepted; if it is rejected the markers are removed.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>Pick corresponding atoms in the two diagrams. First, pick a reference atom, which is then marked with a yellow square. Then pick the corresponding comparison atom. The atoms are marked with green markers.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>Pick corresponding atoms in the two lists, reference first. The atoms are also marked in the diagrams when you pick them.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>If you make a mistake in the mapping, you can simply select the mis-mapped atom in the reference diagram or list, and then select the correct atom in the comparison diagram or list.</p>
        <p>If you want to clear the entire mapping and start over, click <span class="GUI">Clear Mapping</span>.</p>

                <p>This area displays the 2D structure of the reference. The atom numbering is indicated on the structure, and the numbers are colored by element. Atoms that are mapped are marked with a green sphere; atoms for which the mapping has been guessed but not yet accepted are marked with light blue spheres. You can select an atom to start defining a mapping. The atom can be an unmapped atom or it can be an already mapped atom. The selected atom is marked with a yellow square. If you pause the pointer over a mapped atom, it is marked with a green square, and the mapped atom in the comparison structure is also marked with a green square. This also happens if you select a mapped atom, which allows you to identify which atom it is currently mapped to.</p>
