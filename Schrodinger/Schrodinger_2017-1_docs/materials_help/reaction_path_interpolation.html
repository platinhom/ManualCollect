        <h1 class="title">Reaction Path Interpolation Panel</h1><a name="summary"></a>
        <p>Create a linear synchronous transit reaction path by interpolation between a reactant structure and a product structure. The path is returned as a set of structures with a property that defines the distance along the path.</p>
        <p class="opening">To open this panel, choose <span class="GUI">Tasks → Materials → Reaction Path Interpolation</span> in the Task Tool.</p>
        <h2><a name="using"></a>Using the Reaction Path Interpolation Panel</h2>
        <p>The reaction path interpolation procedure is based on the work of Halgren and Lipscomb, <i>Chem. Phys. Lett.</i><b>1977</b>, <i>49</i>, 225.</p>
        <p>In general, the reaction and product structures should be constructed so that the structures are pre-positioned for reaction (in either direction). It is highly recommended that you build the product structures by modifying the reactant structures, breaking bonds and forming new bonds as necessary but <i>not deleting any atoms</i>. Keeping all the atoms is critical to maintaining the atom ordering, which is critical for constructing the path. If you build the products from the reactants, you should do some kind of restrained minimization of the structures that relieves strain but does not significantly reposition the product structures.</p>
        <p>If you have structures that do not fulfil these conditions, the panel offers you ways to change the atom numbering and position the reactants and products, as explained below.</p>
        <p>You can select an option to form a complex of the reactants and a complex of the products, to assist in defining the path. The reactive atoms are identified and the structures are positioned with respect to each other to form a pre-reactive or post-reactive complex. This is only available for bimolecular reactions in which transfer of atoms happens only from one molecule to the other (not exchange of groups), such as S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions, donation of a group to another molecule, or reaction of two molecules to form a single molecule (and its reverse, unimolecular decomposition). Otherwise, you could consider using the <a href="probe_scan.html"><span class="GUI">Probe Scan</span> panel</a> to pre-position the reactants and the products.</p>
        <p>You can renumber the atoms if the reactant and product numbering schemes do not match, in the <span class="GUI">Reorder Atoms</span> panel. This panel shows a 2D image of the reactant and product complexes, and allows you to visually select the corresponding atoms for renumbering.</p>
        <p>The points along the reaction path can be chosen as an evenly-spaced set or as a list of points. The path is defined with a value of 0 for the reactants and 1 for the products. You can add points around the approximate location of the transition state, spaced at 0.02 in the path coordinate with 5 points on each side, by selecting <span class="GUI">Add extra points clustered in transition state region</span>. The presumed transition state location can be chosen as early (25%), midway (50%) or late (75%) in the reaction path.</p>
        <p>The simplest linear synchronous transit path can be obtained by interpolating the Cartesian coordinates of the corresponding atoms in the reactants and the products. This simple path could involve clashes if the structures were not properly aligned - for example, if the lines between the corresponding atoms all passed close to the same point. Distance and internal coordinates are over-determined sets, so fitting is required. Constraints are imposed so that a smooth change in the coordinates between the reactant and product structures is obtained.</p>
        <p>To obtain an initial reaction path for the optimization, the product structure is superimposed onto the reactant structure before the interpolation begins, using the nonreactive (or least reactive) atoms to perform the superposition. The structure obtained at each step of the interpolation is also superimposed on the reactant structure. This process helps prevent drift (translation or rotation of the entire structure), and also makes visualization of the path easier.</p>
        <p>When the path has been generated, the output Maestro file contains all of the structures: first the reactants, then the reactant complex (if requested), the steps in the path, the product complex (if requested), then the products. The step index and distance along the path (in the range 0 to 1) are included as entry properties, and the reactive atoms are identified with an atom-level property. To see these properties in the Project Table, you will have to choose to show them explicitly, or show all properties, as they are not shown by default.</p>

        <h3><a name="feature3"></a>Reaction complex section</h3>
        <p>Pre-position the reactant molecules for the reaction, and the product molecules for the reverse reaction. Structures that are pre-positioned close to the transition state provide better reaction paths than structures that are at their equilibrium geometries and far from the transition state.</p>
        <p>This feature is limited to unimolecular decompositions that form two molecules and bimolecular combination reactions that do not involve exchange of atoms (any leaving group comes from only one of the original molecules) So, for example, an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction would work as the nucleophile combines with the substrate and the leaving group comes from the substrate, but a hydrolysis reaction would not work because the water donates a hydrogen and accepts another fragment.</p>
