        <h1 class="title">Reaction Energetics Enumeration Panel</h1><a name="summary"></a>
        <p>Calculate reaction barriers, enthalpies, and energies of intermediates for a series of related compounds, based on a prototype reaction, which can include multiple transition states and intermediates. The structures for the reactions are enumerated by addition of functional groups to the structures for the prototype reaction.</p>
        <p class="opening">To open this panel, choose <span class="GUI">Tasks → Quantum Mechanics → Reaction Energetics Enumeration</span> in the Task Tool.</p>
        <h2><a name="using"></a>Using the Reaction Energetics Enumeration Panel</h2>
        <p>For a successful evaluation of reaction energetics, the quality and preparation of the input structures is critical. In addition, there are some conditions that the structures must meet.</p>
        <p>The structures that you use in this panel should be close to the reactant, product, intermediate or transition state structures, especially for the transition states. The reactant and product structures should be the minimized pre-reactive and post-reactive complexes. A molecular mechanics minimization (e.g. with MacroModel) of these complexes might be useful as a starting point (but would not be helpful for the transition states or the intermediates). You can perform the geometry optimizations to the minima and transition states of the prototype reaction using Jaguar directly, then import the structures into the panel for the enumeration and energetics evaluation.</p>
        <p>The atom numbering in all the prototype reaction structures must be the same. This is necessary because the attachment points for the substituents must be on the corresponding atoms in these structures. One way to do this is to start from the reactant structure and build the transition state, intermediate, or product structures in the Workspace with the build tools, breaking and forming bonds <i>without deleting any atoms</i>. To ensure that no automatic deletion of hydrogens is done, deselect <span class="GUI">Adjust number of hydrogens following additive build operations</span> under <span class="GUI">Builder – Behavior</span> in the <a href="../maestro_help/preferences.html#builder_behavior"><span class="GUI">Preferences</span> panel</a>. Structures with a common numbering scheme are also needed if you plan to optimize transition states using the LST or QST methods in Jaguar, before importing them into this workflow.</p>
        <p>When you enumerate structures, it is recommended to select <span class="GUI">Quick-clean substituents</span>. This option performs a force-field minimization of the substituent groups to relieve strain and clashes before doing the quantum-mechanical optimization.</p>
        <p>For a faster evaluation of the energetics when doing an enumeration, you can freeze the core atoms and only optimize the substituents, by choosing <span class="GUI">Core</span> from the <span class="GUI">Atoms to freeze during optimization</span> option menu. The energetics will be less accurate, but if the substituents do not affect the location of the core atoms significantly, this may be sufficiently accurate for comparison of different substituents. For higher accuracy, you can do a full optimization of the structures, including transition state searches, by choosing <span class="GUI">None</span>. You can select the atoms to freeze for a balance between accuracy and speed, by choosing <span class="GUI">Custom</span> and picking the atoms in the Workspace. Transition state searches are only done if you do not freeze any atoms. If you do freeze atoms, a minimization (optimization to lowest energy) is done for the non-frozen atoms.</p>
        <p>The energies produced from this panel obviously depend on which atoms are frozen. When no atoms are frozen, the energies of the reactant and product structures are the energies of the pre-reactive or post-reactive complexes. Any frozen atoms are frozen in all structures at their initial coordinates. So to obtain energies with respect to the isolated reactant or product molecules from this panel, for example, you could place the molecules at large distances in the reactant or product structure by (to simulate infinite distance), and freeze at least one atom in each molecule, to ensure that the optimization did not move the molecules toward each other.</p>
        <p>All of the enumerated structures are returned in the output Maestro file, along with properties as described in the table below.</p>
