        <h1 class="title">Thermophysical Properties Analysis Panel</h1><a name="summary"></a>
        <p>Analyze the density of a solid as a function of temperature to determine the coefficient of thermal expansion and the glass transition temperature. The densities are obtained from MD simulations at a set of temperatures in the NPT ensemble.</p>
        <p class="opening">To open this panel, choose <span class="GUI">Tasks → Materials → Thermophysical Properties → Analyze Results</span> in the Task Tool.</p>
        <h2><a name="using"></a>Using the Thermophysical Properties Analysis Panel</h2>
        <p>To obtain the thermochemical properties, two methods are available:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">A bilinear fit, in which a linear regression is performed on the low temperature (glassy) region and the high temperature (rubbery) region of the plot of density against temperature.</li>
            <li value="2">A hyperbola fit, in which a single hyperbolic curve is fitted to all points of the plot of density against temperature.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The coefficient of thermal expansion is the slope of the fitted line when you do a bilinear fit. The glass transition temperature is the temperature at which the two regression lines or the two asymptotes meet. If you want both properties, but want to do the hyperbola fit for T<sub>g</sub>, do the bilinear fit first and save the properties, then do the hyperbola fit and save, to overwrite the T<sub>g</sub> from the bilinear fit.</p>
        <h4>Bilinear fit</h4>
        <p>The points initially included in each linear regression are adjusted so that the sum of the R<sup>2</sup> values is maximized, with all points included in the fit.</p>
        <p>You can adjust the sets of points that are included in the fits by dragging the vertical boundaries of the two colored areas so that they include more or fewer points. These regions do not need to include all the points—for example, you might want to leave out points in the middle that are not clearly in either region. The regressions are redone when the number of points changes. You can also exclude points from the fit (such as outliers) by selecting the points and then clicking <span class="GUI">Remove Selected Points from Fits</span>. By these means you can adjust the fits to maximize the R<sup>2</sup> values. The coefficient of thermal expansion and the glass transition temperature values are also updated when you adjust the sets of points.</p>
        <p>When you have finished adjusting the points in the fit, you can save the computed coefficient of thermal expansion and glass transition temperature to the structure in the project, by clicking <span class="GUI">Store CTE and Tg</span>.</p>
        <h4>Hyperbola fit</h4>
        <p>The equation of the hyperbola is</p>
        <p>ρ = ρ<sub>0</sub> + 2<i>a</i><i>t</i> + <i>b</i><span style="font-size: 125%;">[</span><i>t</i> + √(<i>t</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>e<sup>c</sup></i>) <span style="font-size: 125%;">]</span></p>
        <p>where <i>t</i> = (T − T<sub>0</sub>)/2; ρ is the density and T is the temperature; ρ<sub>0</sub> and T<sub>0</sub> are the density and temperature at the glass transition. The parameters of the fit are <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, ρ<sub>0</sub>, and T<sub>0</sub>. The parameter <i>c</i> determines how close the hyperbola comes to the intersection of the asymptotes. The asymptotes are the two lines obtained for <i>c</i> = −∞:</p>
        <p>ρ<sub>lo</sub> = ρ<sub>0</sub> &amp;plus; <i>a</i>  (T − T<sub>0</sub>)<br /> ρ<sub>hi</sub> = ρ<sub>0</sub> &amp;plus; (<i>a</i>+<i>b</i>) (T − T<sub>0</sub>)</p>
        <p>where lo and hi refer to the glassy (low-temperature) and rubbery (high-temperature) regions.</p>
        <p>The non-asymptotic region is defined by a parameter P, the "asymptotic convergence threshold". This region is defined as the temperature range from T-<i>h</i> to T+<i>h</i>, where</p>
        <p><i>h</i> = e<sup>−<i>c</i>/2</sup> (2P-1) [P(1-P)]<sup>−1/2</sup></p>
        <p>The asymptotes are regarded as defined if there are temperature points that lie outside this region on both sides. The useful range of P is 0.5 to 1.0, which yields values of <i>h</i> from 0 to ∞.</p>
        <p>This method is described more fully in the following paper:</p>
