        <p>Define the surface that is to be used for the planar interface on which the disordered system is built.</p>
        <h2><a name="using"></a>Using the Define Interface Dialog Box</h2>
        <p>When you choose the plane for the interface, you should make sure that it is on the surface (at least approximately), as no changes are made to the substrate. So if you want a particular crystal plane, for example, you should make sure that the crystal plane is exposed (at the surface) in the structure you choose for your substrate.</p>
        <p>You can specify a gap on both sides of the disordered system. If they are zero, you will get a "sandwich" system, in which layers of substrate and the amorphous substance alternate and are in contact with each other. Specifying a large gap between the top of the amorphous region and the image of the substrate allows you to simulate a system in 3D that approximates a 2D system.</p>

            <dd>
                <p>Select this option to define the interface plane as the best fit to all atoms in the structure. As the fitting on its own will place the plane in the middle of the substrate, the plane is moved after fitting so that it rests on the surface of the structure.</p>

            <dd>
                <p>Select this option to define the interface as the plane that is perpendicular to one of the crystal vectors and at the surface of the substrate, and select the vector (<span class="GUI">a</span>, <span class="GUI">b</span>, or <span class="GUI">c</span>).</p>

                <p>Define the interface plane as the best fit to the chosen atoms. Select <span class="GUI">Pick</span> and pick the atoms in the Workspace. The plane is fit to the atoms as you pick, after the third atom is picked, and the plane and arrow marker in the Workspace are centered at the centroid of the picked atoms. No adjustment is made to place the plane at the surface of the substrate.</p>

            <dd>
                <p>Flip the direction of growth of the disordered system. The arrow indicates the direction of growth; the plane indicates the location of the interface between the substrate and the disordered system. If you chose <span class="GUI">Crystal vector</span> or <span class="GUI">Best fit to all atoms</span> to define the interface, the opposite side of the structure is used for the interface: the plane is moved in the Workspace to the opposite surface of the substrate structure and the arrow points in the opposite direction. If you picked atoms to define the plane, it is assumed that you chose the desired interface plane, but the direction of growth is incorrect. In this case, the plane stays where it is but the arrow direction changes.</p>

                <p>Specify the minimum distance of any atom in the substrate in its image in the next cell above the surface to any atom in any molecule in the disordered system. This allows you to create a gap between the top of the disordered system and the next occurrence in that direction of the substrate in a periodic system. By making this value large, you can obtain an approximation to an isolated surface rather than one that is periodic in 3D.</p>
