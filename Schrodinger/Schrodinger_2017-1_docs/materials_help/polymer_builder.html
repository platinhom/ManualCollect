        <h1 class="title">Polymer Builder Panel</h1><a name="summary"></a>
        <p>Build a polymer from one or more monomer units. The polymer can be linear, branched, or dendritic; with different monomers it can also be a periodic or block copolymer or a random copolymer. You can specify the composition, arrangement and configuration of the monomers; the initiator, cascader (if any), and terminator; backbone dihedrals and nonstandard couplings.</p>
        <p class="opening">To open this panel, choose <span class="GUI">Tasks → Materials →  Build : Polymer</span> in the Task Tool.</p>
        <h2><a name="using"></a>Using the Polymer Builder Panel</h2>
        <p>This panel can be used to build a variety of polymers that are linear, branched, or dendritic; any of these can be periodic, block, or random copolymers, and nonstandard couplings can be introduced with given probabilities. The tacticity of the polymer units can be specified if the monomer unit is chiral, and the dihedral between the monomer units can be set.</p>
        <p>You can also create several polymers of different composition by varying the monomer at different points in the repeat unit. Each version of the repeat unit is used to build a separate polymer. The variation is done by using * instead of the letter symbol for the monomer, when defining the repeat unit in a copolymer.</p>
        <p>Building the polymer is relatively quick so it is done in real time. Note that no checking is done for steric clashes, and no minimization is performed on the polymer structure. Polymers are added to the Maestro project as entries, and you can set the coloring and molecular representation for different parts of the polymer as part of the process.</p>
        <p>A central part of the task is to choose or create the initiator, monomers, terminator, and for denritic polymers, the cascader. Several common groups are supplied, but otherwise you can create your own by sketching these groups in 2D (they are automatically converted to 3D). As well as sketching the groups, you must label the points at which these groups are attached to the other groups in the polymer. Instructions for sketching and labeling groups are given below.</p>
        <p>As well as building a single polymer chain or dendrimer, you can create an amorphous cubic cell consisting of multiple polymer chains. The cell may have a nonuniform composition of the polymers if you chose any random element in the generation of the polymer chain. The cell is built by randomly orienting and placing polymers one by one, and checking for clashes. If a clash is found, the latest polymer to be placed is placed again at random, and this process is repeated until a non-clashing placement is found or the number of tries is exceeded. If a non-clashing placement isn't found, building of the cell is tried again from the beginning. If the cell can't be built from the beginning after a specified number of trials, the density or the scaling factor for clash detection is decreased, and the process starts again. You can choose to create a model system for Desmond MD simulations instead of just a structure. The structure or the model system is incorporated into the project.</p>
        <p>If your polymer contains rings, it may happen that a chain passes through the middle of a ring ("spears" the ring). To check the structure for ring-spears, you can use the <a href="locate_ring_spears.html"><span class="GUI">Locate Ring-Spears</span> panel</a>, and either fix them, or adjust the parameters of the polymer building.</p>

            <li value="2">
                <p>Draw the group as it appears in the polymer using the drawing tools.</p>
                <p>This means that monomers should not have double bonds as they exist in the isolated monomer, but single bonds as they exist in the polymer. See the <a href="../maestro_tools_help/2d_sketcher.html">2D Workspace Panel</a> topic for details on how to use the drawing tools.</p>

                <p>Add a bond to an extra atom (a carbon, for example) to each point on the group that will be attached to another group in the polymer.</p>
                <p>For example, if you are building an ethylene monomer, add an extra carbon to each end. At this point the ethylene monomer would look like butane.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p>Label the extra atoms as R groups, by right-clicking on them and choosing one of the R group options from the <span class="GUI">Set R Group</span> submenu.</p>
                <p>The labels to use for each group type are:</p>
                <p><b>Initiator:</b> Use R1 for each extra atom. All of the atoms so labeled will initiate a chain.</p>
                <p><b>Monomer:</b> Label the extra atom at the head as R1, and the extra atom at the tail as R2. If the monomer can have a branch point, label the extra atom for the branch as R3.</p>
                <p><b>Terminator:</b> Label the extra atom as R1. There should be only one extra atom for a terminator.</p>
                <p><b>Cascader:</b> Label the extra atom that is attached to the main chain as R1, and the extra atoms for initiating the new chains as R2.</p>
            </li>

        <p>In this tab you specify the chemical groups you want to use for the polymer: initiator, cascader, terminator, and monomers. How these are arranged is specified in the <span class="GUI">Configuration</span> tab.</p>
        <p>There are some common controls for each type of group, which are described first. Descriptions relating to each type of group are given next.</p>

            <dd>
                <p>This button opens a panel in which you can sketch the structure of the group in 2D. In addition to drawing the structure, you will also have to label groups as R groups, which you can do from the shortcut menu for the atom to be converted to an R group. The labels and their requirements are discussed with the group types, below.</p>
                <p>Each instance of this panel has an option menu and several buttons at the top, which you can use to load or save templates, or clear the drawing area.</p>

Each of the three types of end group have common features, which are described above. The specific conditions on each type are described here; in particular the labels that must be applied to define the points at which the bonds are formed.</p>

The initiator must have at least one R group defined, which is the group that is discarded when forming a bond with the monomer. If you create your own initiator, you must add an R1 label to the group that is discarded.</p>
                        <p>You can add multiple R1 labels, and the (same) polymer is built from each point on the initiator that is so labeled. This enables you to build dendrimers.</p>

                        <p>These controls define a cascader, which is used to create dendritic structures. The cascader must be labeled with one R1 group and two or more R2 groups. The R2 groups define points at which the chain from the initiator is replicated, to form a dendritic structure.</p>
                        <p>In addition to the controls to define the group, there is a <span class="GUI">Generations</span> box, in which you can define the number of replications of the polymer chain in the dendrimer. The minimum number is 2, which means that there is one cascader on each chain from the initiator, to which copies of this chain are attached in place of the R2 groups.</p>

                        <p>Click this button to add a monomer unit. A new set of controls for a monomer unit is added below the last set of monomer controls. The monomers are labeled with letters, A, B, C, and so on. These letter codes are used in the <span class="GUI">Configuration</span> tab to specify the order in which the monomer units are used.</p>

                    <dd>
                        <p>These controls define the monomer structure. Each monomer group must have a single R1 group for the head, and a single R2 group for the tail. If you create your own monomer groups, you must define them as they are in the polymer, not in the isolated molecule. For example, for polyethylene, the monomer must have a single C–C bond, with two hydrogens and one R group at each end. To create this monomer, you would draw butane, and convert the terminal carbons to an R1 and an R2.</p>

If you deselect this option, the geometry is determined by the minimization of the monomer unit when it is converted from 2D to 3D.

                        <p>A monomer group can have an R3 group as well as an R1 and an R2 group. The R3 group designates a point where a new chain can be attached, to create branched polymers. If a monomer group has an R3 group, the <span class="GUI">Branching</span> controls are enabled, and you can specify the probability of branching and the maximum number of generations when branching.</p>
                        <p>The branching probability is applied to each monomer unit independently, to decide whether it will branch or not. With this approach, there is a small but finite probability of none of the monomers branching, or of all of them branching.</p>
                        <p>Each branch is created by taking a copy of the chain before branching and attaching it to the branch point. If you specify more than two generations, branch points are chosen at random for each added chain, so the branch points can be different in each chain that is added in each generation. The process is repeated for each subsequent generation.</p>
                        <p>If an R3 group is not chosen as a branch point in the random selection, it is replaced with the terminating group.</p>
