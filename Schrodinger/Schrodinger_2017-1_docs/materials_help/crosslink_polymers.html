        <h1 class="title">Crosslink Polymers Panel</h1><a name="summary"></a>
        <p>Build polymers from a box of monomers, by linking units according to a reaction scheme in which two specified bonds are broken and two new bonds are formed. Links are made when the atoms that form bonds are within a specified distance. MD at elevated temperature is used to "shake up" the mixture after each round of bond formation so that new bonds can be formed.</p>
        <p class="opening">To open this panel, choose <span class="GUI">Tasks → Materials → Crosslink Polymers</span> in the Task Tool.</p>
        <h2><a name="using"></a>Using the Crosslink Polymers Panel</h2>
        <p>The primary use for this panel is for simulating the formation of thermosetting plastic materials. The monomer units are linked according to a reaction in which two bonds are broken and two bonds formed, so that the new bonds are between the units that had the old bonds. The procedure alternates between detection of potential new bonds (using cutoffs on the interatomic dinstances) and their formation, and short molecular dynamics simulations at elevated temperatures to move the molecules around so that the atoms of the specified bonds can come within linking distance. The procedure is terminated when either no new bonds can be formed, or a target percentage of possible links is reached.</p>
        <p>The procedure can also be applied to the case where there are multiple reactions rather than a single reaction. In this case, the reaction chemistry is defined for each reaction, and a reaction rate is supplied to guide the formation process. When selecting a bond pair to crosslink, the reaction is chosen using a kinetic model involving a Boltzmann factor for the reaction rate and a concentration factor for the number of possible bond pairs that can crosslink. The normalized product of these two factors defines a probability for a particular reaction to occur, and the reaction is then chosen at random with the calculated probabilities. The bond pair that has the smallest interatomic distance parameter for that reaction is chosen for crosslinking. As for the case of a single reaction, the procedure is terminated when no new bonds can be formed, or a target percentage of crosslinks is reached for the reaction with the fewest initial possible crosslinks.</p>
        <p>Before using this panel, you must make a Desmond model system containing the desired monomer units for each simulation. The <a href="disordered_system_builder.html"><span class="GUI">Disordered System Builder</span> panel</a> provides an ideal way of constructing a disordered system of molecules of a specified composition for this purpose. </p>
        <p>Once you have the simulation box (model system), open the panel and select the entries that contain the model systems. You can then define the bonds to be broken and make threshold settings for the bonds to be formed, specify the crosslink saturation, limit on unproductive iterations, and the parameters for the MD simulations. You can run multiple simulations in the same job, but you should ensure that the settings you make apply to all model systems.</p>
        <p>You can then run the job. As Desmond is optimized for GPU execution, you should run the job on a host that has GPU cards installed and a queueing system for managing the jobs. See <a href="../install_guide/batch_queue.htm" class="MCXref xref" xrefformat="{paratext}">Preparing for Batch Queue Submission</a> for more information.</p>

The percentage is taken for the breaking bond  selected from the <span class="GUI">applies to breaking bond</span> option menu. By default this is the breaking bond that has the fewest occurrences (SMARTS matches) in the initial structure, excluding bonds that have zero occurrences. For example, if bond A occurs 100 times and bond B occurs 50 times in the box of monomers, and the value specified is 75%, the job stops when 75% of the occurrences of bond B have been crosslinked.</p>
                        <p>The saturation is calculated as 100(1−N/N<sub>i</sub>), where N is the current number of bonds and N<sub>i</sub> is the initial number of bonds. For multiple reactions, this is computed for the reaction with the smallest N<sub>i</sub>, as explained above. If a reaction produces more of this type of bond, then the saturation could actually become negative if the production rate is greater than the depletion rate. </p>
