        <h1 class="title">Nanostructure Builder Panel</h1><a name="summary"></a>
        <p>Build nanotubes or nanosheets from a specified asymmetric unit, composition, and geometry to a given size. Multi-walled nanotubes and multi-layer nanosheets can be constructed as well as single-walled nanotubes and single nanosheets, and nanotubes with a range of chiral indices can be generated.</p>
        <p class="opening">To open this panel, choose <span class="GUI">Tasks → Materials → Build → Nanostructures</span> in the Task Tool.</p>
        <h2><a name="using"></a>Using the Nanostructure Builder Panel</h2>
        <p>The nanostructure builder can produce single- or multi-walled nanotubes, and single- or multi-layer nanosheets. All structures are based on the usual honeycomb pattern of connectivity, with three neighbors for each atom. The edges can be terminated with a single bond to a chosen terminating group, or left with no terminating group.</p>
        <p>A formal assignment of bonding is made between the atoms. On this basis, the atoms in the nanostructure can be trivalent, so that each atom has three single bonds (as in BN), or tetravalent, so that each atom has two single bonds and one double bond (as for carbon). Other than this, no attempt is made to assign bond orders or formal charges based on valence, and no checking is done on the validity of this assignment, as nanostructures can be built with this panel out of any elements.</p>
        <p>If you plan to use the nanostructures in modeling with force fields (such as molecular dynamics), you will have to choose atoms that are supported by the force field, and have appropriate sp<sup>2</sup> atom types. If the atoms you choose are not trivalent or tetravalent, you will have to assign bond orders and formal charges before using the structure for modeling. You might also have to assign formal charges for trivalent elements.</p>
        <p>For quantum mechanical modeling, connectivity and atom typing is not relevant. You could, for example, generate PbO nanosheets, and ignore the bonding. Generating nanostructures is quicker if you choose not to add double bonds.</p>
        <p>The first step in building nanosheets or nanotubes is to define the basic building block and choose how to terminate the sheets or tubes. This task is common to both types of nanostructure.</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>Specify the composition of the unit cell, by entering the element symbols in the <span class="GUI">Elemental composition</span> text boxes.</p>

            <li value="2">
                <p>Define the length of the bond between the two atoms in the unit cell, by entering a value in the <span class="GUI">Bond length</span> text box.</p>

                <p>Choose an organic fragment to terminate the bonds on the ends of the tubes or the edges of the sheet, from the <span class="GUI">Fragment</span> option menu. If the fragment is polyatomic, you can also perform a minimization of the fragments when they are attached.</p>

        <dd>
            <p>Specify the composition for the unit cell. There are no limitations imposed on the elemental composition, and no imposition of valence rules or assignment of formal charges in the construction of the nanostructure. All atoms have bonds to three neighboring atoms within each sheet or tube (including the terminating groups).</p>
            <p>If you intend to use these structures for studies with force fields (such as MD), you will have to choose atoms that are supported by the force field and have suitable sp2 atom types.

The atom in the fragment that is attached to the nanostructure is held fixed, as is the nanostructure itself.
