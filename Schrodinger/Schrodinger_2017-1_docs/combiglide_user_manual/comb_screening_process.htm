        <h3 class="Heading3Nonum">The Define Combinations step</h3>
        <p>In this step, you first select the core-containing molecule that you want to use for generation of the library. The library is generated by replacing selected side chains in the molecule with other side chains from the reagent files. For each side chain, you identify the bond that defines where the substitution will take place (the <i>attachment position</i>), and specify a reagent file that contains the reagents with the side chains that you want to substitute. The bond is called the <i>grow bond</i>. The combination of an attachment position and a reagent file is called an <i>attachment</i>. The core of the molecule is the part of the molecule that is left when you remove the side chains. The reagent libraries must be prepared beforehand, using the <span class="GUI">Reagent Preparation</span> panel.</p>
        <p>Once you have selected a molecule and the attachment positions for the reagents, and added the reagent files, you can proceed to the next step.</p>
        <h3 class="Heading3Nonum">The Configure Docking step</h3>
        <p>The screening process uses CombiGlide docking to filter out reagents that produce molecules that do not score well. This step assumes that you have already generated the necessary Glide grid files, using the <span class="GUI">Receptor Grid Generation</span> panel. In this step, you set options for the docking of the libraries to the receptor. As well as selecting a grid and making basic settings as for a Glide run, you can specify the full range of Glide constraints for the docked molecules.</p>
        <p>After selecting a grid and setting any desired options, you can proceed to the next step.</p>
        <h3 class="Heading3Nonum"><a name="comb_screening_123727373_33440"></a>The Define Core Poses step</h3>
        <p>In this step, you select the method for determining the poses of the core structure that you want to use in the docking step. These poses are generated by docking one or more molecules that contain the core. These molecules can be the core-containing molecule, the minimally capped core, or some other molecules that you choose. The <i>minimally capped core</i> is the core of the molecule with a minimal capping group at each attachment position. In most cases, the minimal capping group is defined by R, R', R"=Me or Ar=Ph for each reagent. See <a class="Table_Number MCXref xref xrefTable_Number" href="combi_reagent_prep_running_type.htm#combi_reagent_prep_1193905790_745365">Table 1</a> for definitions of R, R', and R".</p>
        <p>You can constrain the core position to prevent it from moving to regions of the receptor that would generate unacceptable binding modes.</p>
        <p>When you have selected a method, you can proceed to the next step.</p>
        <h3 class="Heading3Nonum">The Dock Library step</h3>
        <p>In this step you run the docking jobs. The docking is performed in three stages. In the first stage, the core-containing molecules are docked to obtain a set of core poses, using whatever constraints on the core position you imposed. </p>
        <p>In the second stage, each reagent from each reagent library is added in turn to the core, to produce molecules with a single side chain and the minimal capping groups at the remaining attachment positions. These molecules are docked using CombiGlide XP docking. Reagents that do not generate any good poses are eliminated. This stage can be run independently, and is known as the “single-position docking” stage. </p>
        <p>In the third stage, the poses with a single side chain are combined intelligently to produce molecules that are likely to dock well. These molecules have side chains from the reagent libraries at all attachment points. This stage is the most time-consuming part. Glide constraints are only applied in this stage. This stage is known as the “combinatorial docking” stage. </p>
        <p>After docking, you can export the results of either the single-position docking or the combinatorial docking for further examination. From this step you can also enumerate and dock the entire library without performing the initial screening. </p>
        <p>Once you have docked the combinatorial library, you can proceed to the next step. </p>
        <h3 class="Heading3Nonum">The Analyze Library step</h3>
        <p>In this step, the number of reagents used at each position is reduced to a small set by application of filtering and selection strategies. Filtering is based on structural properties such as molecular weight and counts of structural features, and ADME properties. These properties are generated by QikProp, which is run automatically. The selection strategies identify the “best” reagents at each position, based on the GlideScore of each of the docked structures. When the small reagent set is selected, the library defined by this set can be enumerated. </p>
