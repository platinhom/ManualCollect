        <h1 class="Title">The include and base Settings in the Hosts File</h1>
        <p>The <code>include</code> and <code>base</code> settings offer tools for maintaining a hosts file that can be used across multiple installations of the software.</p>
        <p>The <code>include</code> setting permits you to include a hosts file in another hosts file. This allows you, for example, to make release-independent settings in one hosts file, and use those settings in a hosts file that contains settings for a particular release. The syntax is </p><pre>
include <i class="UserReplace">filename</i></pre>
        <p>where the file name must be an absolute path. </p>
        <p>The <code>base</code> setting can be used to include settings from another entry that are used as defaults, and can be overridden by settings in the current entry. This allows you to specify settings that are common to a number of entries, without having to duplicate them for each entry. The syntax is </p><pre>
base <i class="UserReplace">entry-name</i></pre>
        <p>The examples below illustrate the use of the include and base settings. Suppose you define a hosts file named <code>cluster_queues.hosts</code>, that contains settings for several queues on a cluster. These settings use a base to pick up any common settings for the cluster, such as the location of the software installation and the queue host. The file might look like this:</p><pre>
# Small queue on cluster1
name:         small1
base:         cluster1
processors:   16
&#160;
# Medium queue on cluster1
name:         medium1
base:         cluster1
processors:   64
&#160;
# Large queue on cluster1
name:         large1
base:         cluster1
processors:   256
</pre>
        <p>Note that the base setting refers to an entry that is not in this file. Now you define your main hosts file, <code>schrodinger.hosts</code>, with the settings that are common to the queues and also the software installation location, which will vary from release to release. This file has the base definition for the queues, and the cluster queue definitions are imported from the above file:</p><pre>
# Local host definition
name:         localhost
&#160;
# Base settings for cluster1
name:         cluster1
host:         cluster1.mynetwork.com
schrodinger:  /cluster1/schrodinger/schrodinger2014
queue:        SGE
tmpdir:       /var/tmp
&#160;
include /opt/schrodinger/cluster_queues.hosts
</pre>
        <p>When this hosts file is read, <code>cluster_queues.hosts</code> is imported and the <code>base</code> settings are resolved. Note that <code>cluster_queues.hosts</code> is stored in a release-independent location. The hosts file itself is stored in the usual location in the software installation, on your workstation or wherever you plan to submit jobs from. This approach makes it easy to upgrade to a new software version, as you only have to edit the main hosts file that contains the base settings, change the path to the software installation, and save it in the new installation directory. </p>
        <p>Entries used as a base can also refer to another base. So, for example, you could have entries that just defined the installation directory in your main <code>schrodinger.hosts</code> file, and use them as a base for everything else, which would be imported by an <code>include</code> setting:</p><pre>
# Local host entry
name:         localhost
&#160;
# NFS-mounted installation
name: nfs-installation
schrodinger: /nfs/schrodinger2014-4
&#160;
# Cluster installation
name: cluster-installation
schrodinger: /software/schrodinger2014-4
&#160;
include /opt/schrodinger/cluster.hosts
include /opt/schrodinger/workstations.hosts
</pre>
        <p>The included files could contain both the base settings for the cluster and the settings for the queues, like this (for <code>cluster.hosts</code>):</p><pre>
# Base setting for cluster1
name:         cluster1
base:         cluster-installation
host:         cluster1.mynetwork.com
queue:        SGE
tmpdir:       /var/tmp
&#160;
# Small queue on cluster1
name:         small1
base:         cluster1
processors:   16
...
</pre>
        <p>The base entry for the cluster also has a base setting, for the release-dependent <code>schrodinger</code> setting in the main hosts file. When you install a new release, you only need to copy the main hosts file to the new release directory and edit the <code>schrodinger</code> settings.</p>
