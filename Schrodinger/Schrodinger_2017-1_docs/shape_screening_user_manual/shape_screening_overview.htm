        <h1 class="Title">Overview of Shape Screening</h1>
        <p>The Shape Screening program can be used to screen one or more files or a Phase database against a shape query. Each conformer from a given molecule is aligned to the query in various ways, and a similarity is computed based on overlapping hard-sphere volumes. The conformer and alignment yielding the highest similarity for each molecule is written to a Maestro file, along with the similarity property <code>r_phase_Shape_Sim</code>, which appears in the Project Table as <span class="GUI">Shape Sim</span>. </p>
        <p>The shape query can be a single template molecule, or it can be a set of three or more spheres. The latter form provides a high degree of flexibility in designing the shape. For each molecule searched, Shape Screening returns an aligned structure that provides the best overlap with the shape query. If you are searching a set of homologous structures and the shape query is a member of the same series, then Shape Screening should return the most sensible alignment among all those available. If you are searching against structures that are not necessarily related to the shape query, Shape Screening should return something that looks most like the query in an overall sense.</p>
        <p>The shape search can treat all atoms as equivalent, or it can incorporate information on atom types as part of the search. Searching on atom types favors alignments that superimpose atoms of the same type. There are three possibilities for atom typing in a shape search: use of MacroModel types, typing by element, and use of Phase QSAR types. MacroModel atom types will impose the most stringent conditions on the matching, and Phase QSAR types will impose the most general conditions. </p>
        <p>As an alternative, the shape search can treat each structure as a collection of pharmacophore sites, whose locations are assigned by applying Phase pharmacophore feature definitions. Overlapping volumes are computed only between sites of the same type. </p>
        <p>Volume scoring as part of a search for matches to a hypothesis also uses molecular shape, but there are some important differences between volume scoring in a search for matches and shape-based queries. In the search for matches, the molecules are aligned to the hypothesis, and the volume overlap is then computed on the basis of that alignment. The molecular shape alignment might not be optimal in this case. Shape queries investigate a much greater variety of alignments than a typical search for matches to a hypothesis, and compute volume overlaps that are closer to optimal. A second difference is in the algorithm used to evaluate the volume scores in the search for matches on the one hand, and the shape similarities on the other. However, the shape similarities are a form of volume scoring, and this term is used below for the shape similarities.</p>
