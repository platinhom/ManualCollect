        <p>This panel provides a simplified view of the Project Table contents and the Workspace contents, and allows you to perform actions related to the contents. It has two sub-panels: the Entry List and the Structure Hierarchy.</p>
        <p>To open this panel, choose <span class="GUI">Window → Workspace Navigator</span>, press <span class="Keys">Ctrl+E</span>&#160;(<span class="Keys">⌘E</span>), or click the Workspace Navigator button on the toolbar. <img src="../Resources/Images/maestro/entry_list_button.png" /></p>
        <p>This panel opens by default when you start Maestro.</p>
        <h2><a name="using"></a>Using the Workspace Navigator Panel</h2>
        <p>This panel is intended to provide access to the basic features of the Project Table in a lightweight panel, without having the full <span class="GUI">Project Table</span> panel open, and to provide a convenient way of performing Workspace operations on structures and substructures that can be selected from a hierarchy rather than having to use the selection toolbar. </p>
        <p>The panel is docked into the Workspace by default, so you can easily switch focus from the panel to the Workspace. You can undock the panel if you want to place it somewhere else.</p>

        <h3><a name="entry_list"></a>Entry List</h3>
        <p>The entry list is a simplified view of the Project Table that allows you to perform basic operations such as selection and inclusion without having the full Project Table open.</p>
        <dl>
            <dt><a name="feature1.1"></a>Search button<img src="../Resources/Images/maestro/WN_search_button.png" style="margin-left: 10px;" /></dt>
            <dd>
                <p>The search button displays the search text box and <span class="GUI">Filter</span> button. These allow you to filter the list of entries that is shown in the entry list. Filtering this list has no effect on the selection or the inclusion of the entries, or what is visible in the Project Table. However, once the list is filtered, selection or inclusion of multiple entries with shift-click and control-click operates only on the filtered list.</p>
                <p>To filter the list by title, enter the text to match in the text box. The list is filtered as you type. The matching is case-insensitive. To clear the text filter, click the <span class="GUI">Clear</span> (X) button.</p>
                <p>You can also apply a global filter, by clicking the <span class="GUI">Filter</span> button. The button is indented, to indicate that the global filter is applied. To remove the global filter without removing the text filter, click the button again. There are three ways of defining the global filter, which you can set by clicking and holding on the button, then choosing from the menu that is displayed.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li value="1"><span class="GUI">Included</span>—Show only the entries that are included in the Workspace in the list.</li>
                    <li value="2"><span class="GUI">Selected</span>—Show only the entries that are selected in the Project Table in the list.</li>
                    <li value="3"><span class="GUI">Filter</span>—Open the <a href="esd.html"><span class="GUI">Entry Selection</span> dialog box</a> to define the filter in terms of entry properties or previously defined filters. If you want to change the filter, you can select this item again, even if it is already selected.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Filters are reapplied whenever the Project Table changes. For example, if the global filter is <span class="GUI">Selected</span>, and you deselect an entry, it is removed from the list.</p>

                    <li value="1"><span class="GUI">Show Property</span>—opens a <a href="property_selection.html">property selector</a> in which you can select a single property to show in the entry list.</li>
                    <li value="2"><span class="GUI">Show 2D Structure</span>—show the column that contains the 2D structure.</li>
                    <li value="3"><span class="GUI">Fit to</span>— fit the column widths to the data, the header, or the larger of the two.</li>

            <dd>
                <p>Collapse the Entry List so that only the title bar with the tools is visible. This allows more space for the Structure Hierarchy. The expand button restores the Entry List to its previous size. You can also drag the divider between the  Entry List and the Structure Hierarchy to change their relative sizes.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt><a name="feature1.4"></a>Entry list</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>Lists the project entries, with the <span class="GUI">Row</span> column, the <span class="GUI">In</span> column and the <span class="GUI">Title</span> column displayed by default. For entry groups, the number of entries is shown to the right of the title. The entry list is kept synchronized with the Project Table.</p>
                <p>You can include entries in the Workspace with the usual click, shift-click and control-click in the <span class="GUI">In</span> column. To exclude an entry, you can either control-click or middle-click. To fix  an entry in the Workspace, double-click in the In column. Double-clicking a fixed entry unfixes it but leaves it included in the Workspace; control-click excludes it. </p>
                <p>You can select multiple entries in the list with the usual shift-click and control-click. If the list is filtered and you select with shift-click, only the entries that are shown in the list are added to the selection. For entries that are in between these entries but are hidden, the selection is not changed, so selected entries remain selected, unselected entries are not selected. The same applies to entry inclusion. If the list is filtered, only the entries that are shown in the list are included in the Workspace.</p>
                <p>Shortcut menus are displayed when you right-click on a row, so that you can perform common operations, like Duplicate, Lock, and so on. These menus are the same as the menus that appear in the Project Table, with a few exceptions. For an entry row, the <a href="project_table.html#feature4.1">Entry shortcut menu</a> is shown; for an entry group row, the <a href="project_table.html#feature4.3">Entry group shortcut menu</a> is shown.</p>
                <p>The heading row has a reduced shortcut menu that allows you to show or hide property columns, show the 2D structure, sort, color, or select by a property value, add or remove properties from the Workspace property display, and set the column width.</p>
                <p>The <span class="GUI">Title</span> column has auxiliary feature buttons on the right, if the entry has features such as surfaces, trajectories, or hypotheses. Clicking the button opens a menu for performing actions related to the auxiliary feature.</p>
            </dd>
        </dl>
        <h3><a name="structure_hierarchy"></a>Structure Hierarchy</h3>
        <p>The structure hierarchy shows a list of the contents of all the entries that are included in the Workspace, classified into components of various types. The classification is shown in a tree, so that you can expand or collapse the tree to show the components that constitute a larger component. For example, a receptor entry may be classified into Protein, Ligands, Solvents, and Other. The protein is divided into chains, which are divided into individual residues. You can then operate on the components at any level to perform various display and other actions.</p>
        <dl>
            <dt><a name="feature2.1"></a>Search button<img src="../Resources/Images/maestro/WN_search_button.png" style="margin-left: 10px;" /></dt>
            <dd>
                <p>The search button displays and hides the search text box, so you can filter the hierarchy on the names. For example, filtering on ARG shows all the arginine residues (and anything else whose name happens to match this text).</p>
                <p>To remove the filter, clear the text or use the X button at the right of the search text box.</p>
            </dd>

            <dd>
                <p>Collapse the Structure Hierarchy so that only the title bar with the buttons is visible. This allows more space for the Entry List. The expand button restores the Structure Hierarchy to its previous size. You can also drag the divider between the  Entry List and the Structure Hierarchy to change their relative sizes.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt><a name="feature2.4"></a>Structure hierarchy</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>Lists the content of all entries that are in the Workspace (included entries), in a hierarchy that allows you to examine and operate on the various components of the entry, such as chains, residues, ligands,  monomers, solvent molecules, and so on. Clicking on a row in the hierarchy selects the atoms in the Workspace that belong to the component represented by the row. You can use shift-click and control-click to select multiple rows and therefore select the corresponding atoms in the Workspace.</p>
                <p>The features of each row are listed below. The presence of some of the features depends on the nature of the structure component that the row represents.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li value="1">
                        <p>Visibility check box—Show or hide the atoms in the Workspace for this component. The check box is fully colored if all the atoms in the component are shown in the Workspace; it is partially colored if some atoms are shown and others are hidden, and is not colored if all atoms are hidden. This check box allows you to change what is shown in the Workspace without having to first make an atom selection. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li value="2">
                        <p>Expand/collapse icon—Expand or collapse the item to show its components.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li value="3">
                        <p>Icon—Indicates the type of component: protein, ligand, etc.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li value="4">
                        <p>Name—Name of the component. If it is an entry, the name is the entry title. For components of a chain, the chain letter prefixes the name of the component.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li value="5">
                        <p>Shortcut menu—Right-clicking on the row displays a shortcut menu that depends on the type of component: if an entry, the <span class="GUI">Selected Entries</span> menu is shown; if a structure, the <span class="GUI">Selected Atoms</span> menu is shown. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li value="6">
                        <p>Toolbox button—Clicking this button opens a toolbox for the component, which is usually the <span class="GUI">Style</span> toolbox. The button is displayed on the right of the row when the pointer is over the row.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li value="7">
                        <p>Highlighting—The row is highlighted if any atoms in the component are selected in the Workspace. The highlighting is lighter if only some of the atoms are selected; it is darker if all the atoms are selected. </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>At the top is a separate row for the current atom selection. This row has the same features as other rows, so you can use it for styling the current selection rather than using the <span class="GUI">Style</span> button on the toolbar. </p>
