        <h2><a name="summary"></a>Summary</h2>
        <p>The ePlayer is a tool for displaying the selected entries in the current project one by one, with options to superimpose entries and run a script as each entry is displayed. It is operated from the <span class="GUI">Project Table</span> panel.</p>
        <h2><a name="using"></a>Using the ePlayer</h2>
        <ul>
            <li value="1"><a href="#using.1" class="selected">Overview</a>
            </li>
            <li value="2"><a href="#using.2" class="selected">Using the ePlayer in Step Mode</a>

            </li>
            <li value="4"><a href="#using.4" class="selected">Superimposing Entries</a>
            </li>
            <li value="5"><a href="#using.5" class="selected">Running a Script at Each Step</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3><a name="using.1"></a>Overview</h3>
        <p>The ePlayer controls are available on the <a href="eplayer_toolbar.html">ePlayer toolbar</a> and from the <span class="GUI">ePlayer</span> menu in the <span class="GUI">Project Table</span> panel. The toolbar controls are like most other player controls: you can skip to either end, step in either direction one at a time (Step mode), or play in either direction (Continuous mode).</p>
        <p>In addition to simply displaying each entry in the Workspace, you can perform a superposition or execute a script when each entry is displayed. The options for these actions are available in the <a href="eplayer_options_panel.html"><span class="GUI">ePlayer Options</span> panel</a>, which you open by choosing <span class="GUI">ePlayer â†’ Options</span> in the <span class="GUI">Project Table</span> panel.</p>
        <p>The ePlayer includes each of the selected entries in the Workspace without affecting any unselected entries. Atoms in the Workspace that do not belong to any of the selected entries are left in place during ePlayer operation, to provide context. So, for example, you could include a protein in the Workspace, then select a number of ligands and play through the ligands. Each would be displayed in turn with the protein.</p>
        <h3><a name="using.2"></a>Using the ePlayer in Step Mode</h3>
        <p>Step mode is a means of including entries in the Workspace consecutively. As each entry is included, superposition or script execution takes place if you have selected these options. Any changes to the project are made according to the synchronization options you have selected in the <a href="../maestro_help/preferences.html#workspace_changes"><span class="GUI">Preferences</span> panel</a>. In step mode, the ePlayer "remembers" the last entry that was displayed by the ePlayer. When you click the <span class="GUI">Previous</span> or <span class="GUI">Next</span> toolbar buttons, the entry that is before or after the last entry displayed becomes the new displayed entry.</p>
        <h3><a name="using.3"></a>Using the ePlayer in Continuous Mode</h3>
        <p>Continuous mode is a means of automatically displaying the selected entries in sequence. Unlike step mode, the synchronization preferences are ignored. Instead, there is an option in the <a href="eplayer_options_panel.html"><span class="GUI">ePlayer Options</span> panel</a> to save Workspace changes during continuous mode. You can also control the rate at which entries are displayed from this panel.</p>
        <p>Continuous play mode has two options for looping, which you can select from the <span class="GUI">Loop</span> submenu of the <span class="GUI">ePlayer</span> menu or from the <span class="GUI">Loop</span> toolbar button menu. <span class="GUI">Single direction</span> plays through the entries in the chosen direction to the end of the selection, then starts again at the other end. <span class="GUI">Oscillate</span> plays through the entries in the chosen direction to the end of the selection, then reverses direction and plays through the entries to the other end, and reverses direction again. You can stop play by pressing <span class="Keys">ESC</span>.</p>
        <h3><a name="using.4"></a>Superimposing Entries</h3>
        <p>You can superimpose the entries as you step or play through them, by choosing an option in the <a href="eplayer_options_panel.html"><span class="GUI">ePlayer Options</span> panel</a>. The two options are to superimpose each entry on the last entry, or to superimpose each entry on a reference entry. The reference entry does not have to be one of the selected entries, and it does not have to be included in the Workspace. When a superposition is performed, the coordinates of the structure change. In Step mode, the change is saved according to your synchronization preferences. In Continuous mode, the change is saved if you have the relevant option set in the <span class="GUI">ePlayer Options</span> panel.</p>
        <h3><a name="using.5"></a>Running a Script At Each Step</h3>
        <p>You can run a script when each entry is included in the Workspace during ePlayer operation, by choosing a script in the <span class="GUI">ePlayer Options</span> panel. In Step mode, any changes are saved according to your synchronization preferences. In Continuous mode, changes are saved if you have the relevant option set in the <span class="GUI">ePlayer Options</span> panel.</p>
