        <h1 class="title">Manage Custom Property Families Dialog Box</h1><a name="summary"></a>
        <p>In this dialog box you can create, edit and delete custom property families. Property families are also created by applications; these families cannot be changed.</p>
        <p class="opening">To open this panel, choose <span class="GUI">Property → Custom Families</span></p>
        <h2><a name="using"></a>Using the Manage Custom Property Families Dialog Box</h2>
        <p>Some procedures are given below for creating and editing custom property families. Changes that you make to a property family are applied immediately: there is no confirmation for changes to the properties included, or for deleting a family. You should therefore take care to make a copy of any family that you do not want to change or delete accidentally.</p>
        <p>The primary property families for each application are custom families, which you can change if you want. To restore the default definitions of these families, click <span class="GUI">Reset Primary Families</span>. You can change the primary property families from the Tree view of the properties by dragging properties between the primary and secondary sets. To open the Tree view, choose <span class="GUI">Properties → Tree</span> or click the <span class="GUI">Tree</span> toolbar button.</p>
        <p>Property family definitions are stored in the file <code>custom_property_groups</code> in your <a href="../maestro_help/glossary.html#user_resources">user resources directory</a>. Thus, they are not tied to a particular project, but are part of your Maestro customization.</p>
