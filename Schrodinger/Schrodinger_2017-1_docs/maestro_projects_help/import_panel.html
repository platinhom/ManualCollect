        <h1 class="title">Import Dialog Box</h1><a name="summary"></a>
        <p>The <span class="GUI">Import</span> panel allows you to import structures and their properties into the current project from Maestro files and a wide variety of other file formats, including PDB, MDL SD, and Sybyl Mol2 formats, files containing a list of SMILES strings, MacroModel and Jaguar input and output files, MCPRO input files, Desmond CMS files; and from many other file formats supported by the OpenBabel file conversion utility. If you are importing structures from Maestro files, you can also import various settings. When the structures are imported, you can control which structures, if any, are displayed in the Workspace. You can import structures from multiple files at the same time. Multiple structures from any single file can be added as an entry group to the Project Table, with the group named after the file.</p>
        <p class="opening">To open this panel, choose <span class="GUI">File → Import Structures</span> in the main window or <span class="GUI">Table → Import → Structures</span> in the <span class="GUI">Project Table</span> panel.</p>
        <h2><a name="using"></a>Using the Import Dialog Box</h2>
        <p>To import structures from one or more files, you can either enter the file names directly into the <span class="GUI">File name</span> text box or use the <span class="GUI">Look in</span> tools to navigate to and select files.</p>
        <p>Maestro opens and reads the files using the current settings, which are set in the <span class="GUI">Options</span> section of the panel. To display this section, click <span class="GUI">Options</span>. Maestro accepts both absolute (e.g. <tt>/home/joe/file1.dat</tt>) and relative (e.g. <tt>file1.dat</tt>) file names.</p>
        <p>Maestro adds two properties to the structures on import: the full path to the file from which the structures were imported (<span class="GUI">Source Path</span>), and the file name without the path <span class="GUI">(Source File</span>). If these properties already exist in the imported structures, they are overwritten.</p>
        <p>You can drag and drop Maestro, SD, PDB, XYZ, and MOL2 files from your window manager's file explorer onto the Workspace to import the structures in the file. When you do so, the first structure in the first file is added to the Workspace (rather than replacing it) and the new entries are added to the entry selection in the Project Table.</p>
        <p>On Windows, you can double-click on Maestro, SD, PDB, and MOL2 files to import them into the most recent Maestro session, or a new session if Maestro is not running.</p>
        <p>If the structures you want to import are in another project, you can import them by choosing <span class="GUI">File → Import from Project</span>. A project selector opens, so you can select the project, and then a dialog box opens that lists the entries in the project, displaying the title and the PDB ID.</p>
        <p>If you want to import structures from a file that you have recently imported from, you can choose <span class="GUI">File → Import Recent Structures</span> → <i>filename</i>. The file is imported with the current import settings. This is especially useful when importing into a different project, as the list records all recent imports in any Maestro session or project. The number of files displayed on the list can be set in the <a href="../maestro_help/preferences.html#general_history"><span class="GUI">General – History</span> tab</a> of the <span class="GUI">Preferences</span> panel.</p>
        <p>You can import structures by entering a text command in the <span class="GUI">Command Input Area</span> in the main window. To import structures from a file, enter:</p>
        <p><tt>entryimport </tt><i>filename</i>
        </p>
        <p>including any appropriate option or path name.</p>
        <h3><a name="progress"></a>Import Progress and Reporting</h3>
        <p>If the import takes more than a few seconds, or there are errors on import, the <span class="GUI">Import Progress</span> dialog box opens. The dialog box shows which file is being read and how many structures have been read. It also shows whether there have been any errors or warnings on import, and shows the related messages in a text area. You can show or hide these messages by clicking the <span class="GUI">Details</span> button. You can also copy and paste the messages into another application with the usual key strokes.</p>
        <p>You can suspend import by clicking the <span class="GUI">Pause</span> button. This allows you to examine any messages that were generated, and choose whether to continue with the import or cancel it. The button changes to <span class="GUI">Resume</span>, so you can continue the import.</p>
        <p>If you cancel the import, the structures imported successfully are kept. If you want to delete these structures, click the <span class="GUI">Undo</span> button, or choose <span class="GUI">Edit → Undo</span> in the main window.</p>
        <p>When the import finishes, the dialog box remains open if there were any errors or warnings, or if the messages area is displayed. The <span class="GUI">Cancel</span> button changes to <span class="GUI">OK</span> so that you can dismiss the dialog box when you have finished examining the messages.</p>
        <h3><a name="import7"></a>Importing Compressed Files</h3>
        <p>Maestro can read compressed Maestro, SD, PDB, and SMILES files in gzip format, and uncompress them while reading. It recognizes these files automatically by the extension <code>.maegz</code> or <code>.mae.gz</code> for Maestro files, <code>.sdfgz</code> or <code>.sdf.gz</code> for SD files, <code>.pdb.gz</code> for PDB files, and <code>.smigz</code> or <code>.smi.gz</code> for SMILES files. To read compressed files in other formats, you must uncompress them first, for example using <code>gunzip</code> on Linux, or one of the zip applications on Windows. If the compressed files do not have the appropriate extensions, rename them to include the proper extensions. This renaming step may be necessary particularly when downloading PDB files from internet sites.</p>
        <h2><a name="features"></a>Import Dialog Box Features</h2>
        <p>The <span class="GUI">Import</span> panel has the standard file selection tools that usually appear in <a href="../maestro_help/fileselector.html">File Selectors</a>, including a custom file filter. Options for display, structure selection, grouping of structures, and so on, are hidden by default, but can be displayed by clicking <span class="GUI">Options</span>. The options are described below. Other settings for import are available in the <a href="../maestro_help/preferences.html#project_import"><span class="GUI">Preferences</span> panel</a>.</p>

                <p>When you import structures, they can be added to the Project Table as entry groups. This option menu allows you to create a group for each file with multiple structures (the default) or for all files, to create a single group for all files, or to import structures without placing them in an entry group (<span class="GUI">None</span> option). This choice applies whether you are importing from a single file or from multiple files.</p>

            <dd>
                <p>If the file contains properties that classify the structures into groups and subgroups, use these properties to set up groups and subgroups in the project. These groups and subgroups are created underneath any group created due to a choice from the <span class="GUI">Create groups for</span> option menu. The grouping properties are added to Maestro files when entries are exported, and when Phase hypotheses are generated. Phase hypotheses (<code>.phypo</code>, <code>_phypo.maegz</code>, <code>_phypo.mae.gz</code>) are always imported with preservation of groups, regardless of the setting of this option.</p>
