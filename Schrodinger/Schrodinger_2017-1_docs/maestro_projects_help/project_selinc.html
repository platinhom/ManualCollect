        <h1>Entry Selection and Inclusion</h1>
        <p>In Maestro, <i>selection</i> and <i>inclusion</i> are different concepts.</p>
        <p>Selection is the choice of an entry (row) in the Project Table for some operation. When you select an entry, the entry row is highlighted in a different color. Selection works in the same way and has the same meaning as selection in tables in most graphical user interfaces. A selection forms the basis for most of the operations in the Project Table. For operations on large numbers of entries first you select all of the rows to operate upon, then you specify the action.</p>
        <p>Inclusion is displaying an entry in the Workspace. The  icon in the <span class="GUI">In</span> column of the Project Table or Entry List indicates whether the entry is included in, excluded from, or fixed in the Workspace.</p>
        <p>Clicking on a row selects the entry. Clicking in the <span class="GUI">In</span> column in a row changes the entry's inclusion in the Workspace. Selecting an entry does NOT change its inclusion.</p>
        <h2><a name="sel"></a>Entry Selection</h2>
        <p>Entries can be selected and deselected directly from the Project Table in the following ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p>To select one entry and deselect all others, click in the <span class="GUI">Row</span> column for the entry.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>To select or deselect one row without affecting others, hold down the <span class="Keys">Ctrl</span> key and click ("control-click") in the <span class="GUI">Row</span> column for the entry.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>To select a contiguous range of entries, click in the <span class="GUI">Row</span> column for the first entry in the range, hold down the <span class="Keys">Shift</span> key and click ("shift-click") in the <span class="GUI">Row</span> column for the last entry in the range.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>If the entry is not selected, you can click anywhere in the row except the <span class="GUI">In</span> column to select it. However, if the entry is selected, clicking in any column other than the <span class="GUI">Row</span> column or the <span class="GUI">In</span> column puts the cell into Edit mode. It is therefore recommended to always use the <span class="GUI">Row</span> column when selecting entries.</p>
        <p>There are several other ways of selecting entries that meet certain criteria:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p>To select all entries, choose <span class="GUI">Select → All</span>, or press <span class="Keys">Ctrl+A</span>&#160;(<span class="Keys">⌘A</span>)
.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>To clear the selection (deselect all entries), choose <span class="GUI">Select → None</span>, or press <span class="Keys">Ctrl+U</span>&#160;(<span class="Keys">⌘U</span>)
).</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>To invert the entire selection (select unselected entries, deselect selected entries), choose <span class="GUI">Select → Invert All</span> .</p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p>To invert the selection within each entry group  choose <span class="GUI">Select → Invert Groups</span> .</p>
            </li>
            <li value="5">
                <p>To select all the entries in an entry group, click the entry group row. Control-click a group row to add the group entries to the selection or remove the group entries from the selection.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="6">
                <p>To select entries that have not yet been viewed, choose  <span class="GUI">Select → New</span> .</p>
            </li>
            <li value="7">
                <p>To select entries whose structures match a SMARTS pattern, choose <span class="GUI">Select → By SMARTS</span>. See the <a href="select_by_smarts.html"><a href="select_by_smarts.html" class="MCXref xref" xrefformat="{paratext}">Select by Smarts Panel</a></a> topic for details.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="8">
                <p>To select entries based on values of a property, right-click the property header and choose <span class="GUI">Select by Property Value</span>. See the <a href="select_by_smarts.html"><a href="select_by_property_value.html" class="MCXref xref" xrefformat="{paratext}">Select by Property Value Dialog Box</a></a> topic for details.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="9">
                <p>To select the same number or percentage of entries in each selected group, starting either from the first or last entry in the group, choose <span class="GUI">Select → From Groups</span>, and set the selection in the <span class="GUI">Select from Groups</span> dialog box. Percentages are rounded to the nearest number of entries, so it is possible for no entries to be selected from a group.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="10">
                <p>To make a random selection of entries, choose <span class="GUI">Select → Random</span>, and choose the number or percentage of entries to select and the range of entries to select from, in the <span class="GUI">Random Selection</span> dialog box. Percentages are rounded to the nearest number of entries, so it is possible for no entries to be selected.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>To perform more complex entry selection based on entry properties, use the <a href="esd.html" class="MCXref xref" xrefformat="{paratext}">Entry Selection Dialog Box</a>. Choose <span class="GUI">Select → Only</span>, <span class="GUI">Select → Add</span>, or <span class="GUI">Select → Deselect</span> to open this dialog box and make settings to select only the rows specified, add the specified rows to the selection, or delete the rows from the selection.</p>
        <p data-mc-conditions="menu_paths and">For example, to select only the entries that are included in the Workspace:</p>
        <ol data-mc-conditions="menu_paths and">
            <li value="1">
                <p>Choose <span class="GUI">Select → Only</span>.</p>
                <p>The <span class="GUI">Entry Selection</span> dialog box opens.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>Choose <span class="GUI">Inclusion state</span> from the <span class="GUI">Property</span> list.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>Select <span class="GUI">Included (or Fixed)</span></p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p>Click <span class="GUI">Add</span>, then click <span class="GUI">OK</span>.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p data-mc-conditions="menu_paths and">To add the Workspace entries to the selection, you would choose <span class="GUI">Select → Add</span> instead.</p>
        <p>You can also select entries from plots in the <a href="scatter_plot.html">Scatter Plot Panel</a>. This is a useful means of visually selecting entries on the basis of their properties.</p>
        <h2><a name="inc"></a>Entry Inclusion</h2>
        <p>Entries can be included in or excluded from the Workspace in the following ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p>To include one entry and exclude all others, click the <span class="GUI">In</span> column for that entry.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>To include or exclude one entry without affecting others, hold down the <span class="GUI">CTRL</span> key and click the <span class="GUI">In</span> column for that entry.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>To include a contiguous range of entries, click the <span class="GUI">In</span> column for the first entry in the range, hold down the <span class="GUI">SHIFT</span> key and click ("shift-click") the <span class="GUI">In</span> column for the last entry in the range.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p>To include multiple entries in the Workspace and exclude all others, first select the entries, then  press <span class="Keys">Ctrl+N</span>&#160;(<span class="Keys">⌘N</span>)
 or  choose <span class="GUI">Entry → Show in Workspace →  Include Only</span>.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="5">
                <p>To exclude multiple entries from the Workspace, first select the entries, then  press <span class="Keys">Ctrl+X</span>&#160;(<span class="Keys">⌘X</span>)
 or choose  <span class="GUI">Entry →  Show in Workspace → Exclude</span>.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="6">
                <p>To include the next (or previous) selected entry in the Workspace and exclude the current entry, press the <span class="Keys">Right Arrow</span> (or <span class="Keys">Left Arrow</span>) key. If there are multiple entries included in the Workspace, the action is applied to all of the included entries. This is a useful way of stepping through one or more sets of entries, displaying them in turn in the Workspace.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Entries can be fixed in the Workspace or unfixed (fix status removed) in the following ways.  Fixing an entry means that it remains in the Workspace until you explicitly exclude it. It is not removed as a consequence of another inclusion action, such as including only another entry. You can make changes to entries that are fixed in the Workspace. Fixed entries are marked with a pin icon in the <span class="GUI">In</span> column of the <span class="GUI">Project Table</span> panel or <span class="GUI">Entry List</span> panel.</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p>To fix a single entry in the Workspace, double-click the <span class="GUI">In</span> column for the entry.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>To unfix a single entry without excluding it from the Workspace, double-click the <span class="GUI">In</span> column for the entry.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>To unfix a single entry and exclude it from the Workspace, control-click or middle-click the <span class="GUI">In</span> column for the entry.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p>To fix one or more entries in the Workspace, first select the entries, then choose <span class="GUI">Entry →  Show in Workspace → Fix</span>.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can also include entries from plots in the <a href="scatter_plot.html">Scatter Plot Panel</a>. This is a useful means of choosing entries for inclusion on the basis of their properties.</p>
        <p>If you choose to include a large number of entries in the Workspace, a warning dialog box is displayed, as there is a risk that the inclusion will take up too much memory and degrade performance or freeze Maestro altogether. This is particularly likely if the entries have large numbers of atoms, such as proteins. You can set the number of entries at which the warning is displayed in this dialog box, and you can choose to continue or to cancel the inclusion. Once the inclusion starts, a progress dialog box is displayed if the inclusion takes more than a few seconds. You can stop the include operation in this dialog box at the last entry included by clicking <code>Stop</code> or pressing the <span class="Keys">Esc</span> key.</p>
        <h2><a name="ex"></a>Example</h2>
        <p>Suppose you want to include into the Workspace all of the entries that start with the name "ligand". This is done by first selecting the entries and then including only the selected entries.</p>
        <p>To select all of the rows whose title starts with "ligand" (assume the titles are ligand1, ligand2, etc.):</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>Choose <span class="GUI">Select → Only</span> to open the <span class="GUI">Entry Selection</span> dialog box.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>Choose <span class="GUI">Title</span> from the <span class="GUI">Properties</span> list.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>Select <span class="GUI">Matches</span> and enter <code>ligand*</code> in the text box.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p>Click <span class="GUI">Add</span> then click <span class="GUI">OK</span>.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="5">
                <p>Choose <span class="GUI">Entry → Show in Workspace →  Include Only</span>..</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>The entries that are in the selection are included in the Workspace and all other entries are excluded.</p>
