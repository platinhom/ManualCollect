        <h1 class="Title">Desmond Replica Exchange Simulations</h1>
        <p>Many molecular systems have conformations that are separated by significant free energy barriers. It can be difficult to sample such conformations if they differ by concerted or collective shifts of many atoms. This commonly occurs in protein-ligand complexes. Random methods such as Monte Carlo conformational searches have trouble generating such collective changes, while thermal methods such as molecular dynamics have trouble surmounting the free energy barriers. Replica exchange simulations [<a class="Ref_Number_Only MCXref xref xrefRef_Number_Only" href="desmond_references.htm#desmond_references_1021378405_743586">42</a>, <a class="Ref_Number_Only MCXref xref xrefRef_Number_Only" href="desmond_references.htm#desmond_references_1021378405_743907">43</a>] attempt to tackle this problem by allowing the system to spend some time at elevated temperatures in addition to the temperature of interest. Time spent at elevated temperatures permits the system to evolve faster, in part by more readily crossing free energy barriers. </p>
        <p>Desmond supports replica exchange simulations in which multiple copies of the system are simulated at different temperatures, which usually range from the temperature of interest up to 700 K or more. Periodically during the simulation, attempts are made to exchange the coordinates of copies that are at different temperatures. The exchange is processed in a Monte Carlo-like process: select the systems to attempt to exchange and then use a Metropolis-like criterion to decide whether to accept the change <a class="Reference_Number MCXref xref xrefReference_Number" href="desmond_references.htm#desmond_references_1021378405_743586">[<span style="color: #0e6895;" class="mcFormatColor">42</span>]</a>. The exchange acceptance ratio satisfies the detailed balance or balance condition so that each replica remains in equilibrium after the exchange. When many such exchanges are accepted over the course of an extended simulation, multiple systems with very different histories can visit the temperature of interest. While systems spend time at higher temperatures they explore conformational space significantly more rapidly than if they remained at the target temperature. Thus the composite trajectory at the temperature of interest may contain a more diverse collection of conformations than if multiple simulations were performed at the target temperature. </p>
        <p>As with a regular molecular dynamics simulation each replica may be run on multiple processors (CPUs) or GPUs. Since the simulation of each replica proceeds independently between exchange attempts the additional level of parallelization achieved by running multiple replicas is highly efficient. On GPUs, time slicing is used to advance replicas at the same rate.</p>
        <p>Replica exchange simulations can be set up and run from the <span class="GUI">Replica Exchange</span> panel, which you open by choosing <span class="GUI">Tasks → Classical Simulation → Molecular Dynamics → Replica Exchange</span> in the Task Tool.</p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="replica_exchange.png" style="margin: 2px;" />
        </p>
        <p>In the <span class="GUI">Simulation</span> section, you can make settings for the replica exchange job. The settings for the simulation time, recording interval, ensemble class and model system relaxation are the same as for a molecular dynamics simulation, and are described in <a class="TopicLink MCXref xref xrefTopicLink" href="desmond_panels_md.htm#desmond_panels_3537631757_743821">Desmond Molecular Dynamics Simulations</a>. The default ensemble for replica exchange is NPT. If your highest temperature is above 373&#160;K you might want to change the ensemble to NVT. Exchanges are done between nearest neighbors. The specific tasks are to set the number of replicas, temperature range, and temperature profile. </p>
        <p>The temperature range is set in the <span class="GUI">Temperature range</span> text boxes. The defaults are 300 K for the low temperature and 310 K for the high temperature. You should adjust the low and high temperature values to suitable values. There are four options for the temperature profile:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p class="ListPara"><span class="GUI">quadratic</span>—Set the temperatures by quadratic interpolation between the minimum and maximum, with the high temperature at the maximum of the quadratic curve.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p class="ListPara"><span class="GUI">linear</span>—Set the temperatures by linear interpolation between the maximum and the minimum.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p class="ListPara">auto—Automatically set the number of replicas and the temperature schedule so that the acceptance ratio is approximately 30%. </p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p class="ListPara"><span class="GUI">manual</span>—Set the temperatures manually, by editing the temperatures in the replica table. When you select this option the table becomes editable.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Information on the temperatures is displayed in the replica table. You can edit the temperatures by selecting <span class="GUI">manual</span> for the temperature profile. Some guidance on selecting temperatures is available in Ref. <a class="Reference_Number MCXref xref xrefReference_Number" href="desmond_references.htm#desmond_references_1021378405_743603">[<span style="color: #0e6895;" class="mcFormatColor">44</span>]</a>. Setting up the temperatures and the number of replicas for a meaningful simulation can be difficult. For assistance with this task, contact <a href="mailto:help@schrodinger.com">help@schrodinger.com</a>.</p>
        <p>The replica exchange simulation produces one trajectory for each replica, labeled <i class="UserReplace">jobname</i><code>_replica</code><i class="UserReplace">num</i><code>_trj</code>, where <i class="UserReplace">num</i> is the index of the replica, starting from 0, and corresponds to the replica index in the replica table. You can display a temperature versus time plot of the replicas and the exchanges that were made—see <a class="TopicLink MCXref xref xrefTopicLink" href="desmond_analysis_repexch.htm#desmond_analysis_3995917493_762028">Replica Exchange Dynamics Review</a>.</p>
