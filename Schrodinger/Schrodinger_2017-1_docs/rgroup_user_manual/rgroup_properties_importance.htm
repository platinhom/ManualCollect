        <h1 class="Title">Importance Analysis of R-Groups</h1>
        <p>Importance analysis addresses the question of how sensitive the property of interest is to R-group variation at that position. A position is more important than another if varying the R group at that position leads to greater property differences than are observed when the R group at the other position is varied. The importance value of a position is the range of the property over the R groups at that position, averaged over all structures containing a given R group at that position. As an example of its use, a position in which the range of the property does not vary much as the R group is changed may not be very important for improving the potency of a lead compound, whereas a position in which the property varies a great deal may be considered much more important.</p>
        <p>The <span class="GUI">Importance Analysis</span> panel presents the results of importance analysis and also displays the average of the property for each R group. You can open the <span class="GUI">Importance Analysis</span> panel by clicking <span class="GUI">Importance Analysis</span> in the <span class="GUI">R-Group Viewer</span> panel, or by choosing <span class="GUI">Show R Groups</span> from the shortcut menu in the histogram display of the <span class="GUI">Heat Map</span> panel.</p>
        <p>The panel shows a histogram of the importance value of a chosen property for each position, normalized to one for the most important position. It also contains a table showing the values of a selected function of that property for each R group at a selected position. You can choose the property and the function in the <span class="GUI">Displayed property</span> section. To select the position, click the position in the histogram. The current position is marked in the histogram with an asterisk. When you select a property, the current position is set to the most important position.</p>
        <p>The properties for each R group are displayed as a heat map, colored by value. You can choose how the values in the cells is displayed from the <span class="GUI">Cell Display</span> option menu. The choices are the same as in the <span class="GUI">Heat Map</span> panel (see below). Likewise, you can set the color range and the numerical display by clicking <span class="GUI">Legend and Settings</span>, and you can set the cell size. You can sort the property values in ascending or descending order, by clicking on the column heading.</p>

        </p>
        <p>If you want to make a copy of the results, you can export them. Clicking <span class="GUI">Export Graph</span> exports an image of the histogram in PNG, TIFF, or JPEG format; likewise clicking <span class="GUI">Export Image</span> exports an image of the table, with the same choice of formats. Clicking <span class="GUI">Export CSV</span> exports the table data to a CSV file, with a SMILES string for the structure. The SMILES string includes stereochemistry, and marks the attachment points with [Xe] and [Kr] (as the nominal capping group).</p>
        <p>Ideally, we would like to interpret the importance measure as characteristic of a position. For example, positions that make intimate contact with a receptor might be expected to exhibit greater variation of a binding property when its R groups are altered than one which protrudes into the solvent. However, there are several caveats to this interpretation. Most SAR data sets have very different numbers of structures at the various positions. Even if all else were equal, we would expect positions with more R groups to exhibit greater property variation and therefore to appear more important. Even if all positions had the same number of R groups, we would expect positions whose R groups exhibit greater chemical variability to exhibit a greater range of property values upon variation and hence a greater importance. For example, the chemists designing the SAR study might have had reason to believe that it is important to place hydrogen-bond donors at a given position. They might then sample only such R groups there, and this could in some cases lead to minimal property variation and low importance. These possibilities should be kept in mind when interpreting the importance measure.</p>
