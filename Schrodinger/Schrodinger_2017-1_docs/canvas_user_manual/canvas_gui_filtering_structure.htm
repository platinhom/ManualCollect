        <h1 class="Title">Filtering the Canvas Spreadsheet by Structure</h1>
        <p>You can filter the structures based on their chemical content, which includes the usual functional groups. This task is performed in the <span class="GUI">Structure Filter</span> dialog box, which you open by choosing <span class="GUI">Structure </span>→<span class="GUI"> Structure Filter</span>. </p>
        <p>Each condition on the occurrence of a chemical feature is specified by a row of the table. Complex filters can be set up by using multiple rows. The structures that pass all the filters are returned when you run the job. Thus, there is an implicit AND applied between the rows. You can invert the filter to return the structures that fail any of the filters, by selecting <span class="GUI">Invert logic (retain failures)</span>.</p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="structure_filter.png" style="margin: 2px;" />
        </p>
        <p>The chemical features are defined in terms of SMARTS patterns. In the <span class="GUI">SMARTS</span> column you can enter the SMARTS patterns to filter on, and in the <span class="GUI">Min</span> and <span class="GUI">Max</span> columns, you can enter the minimum and maximum number of occurrences of the SMARTS pattern in a structure that are required for the structure to pass through the filter. You must enter at least a minimum or a maximum, and you can enter both. In the <span class="GUI">Comments</span> column you can annotate the SMARTS pattern—for example, to give names to functional groups. You can insert a row above the selected row by clicking <span class="GUI">Insert</span>, and you can delete the selected rows by clicking <span class="GUI">Delete</span>.</p>
        <p>
            Structure files can be used to generate SMARTS patterns. To do this, import a file in Maestro, SD, or SMILES only format with the <span class="GUI">Import</span> button. The structures in the file are converted into SMARTS patterns, and added to the rows of the table. </p>
        <p>When you have created a filter, you can save it in the project for later use by clicking <span class="GUI">Save</span>. A dialog box opens, in which you can name the filter. The filter is then listed on the <span class="GUI">Use </span>option menu and under <span class="GUI">Structure Filters</span> in the <span class="GUI">Project View</span> window. If you want to store the filter outside the project, for example, to import into another project, click <span class="GUI">Export</span>. A file selector opens, in which you can save the filter in a file with a <code>.flt</code> extension.</p>
        <p>To delete a filter, right click on it in the <span class="GUI">Project View</span> window and choose <span class="GUI">Delete</span>.</p>
        <p>You can also load, edit, and apply existing filters. To load a filter from the project, choose the filter from the <span class="GUI">Use</span> option menu. The table is replaced with the data for the selected filter. To apply multiple filters, select <span class="GUI">Apply</span>, then choose the filter from the option menu. The selected filter is appended to the patterns in the table. Four standard filters are available: <span class="GUI">REOS</span> (“rapid elimination of swill”), <span class="GUI">PAINS1</span>, <span class="GUI">PAINS2</span>, and <span class="GUI">PAINS3</span> (pan assay interference filters <a class="Reference_Number MCXref xref xrefReference_Number" href="canvas_references.htm#canvas_references_3811068687_744066">[<span style="color: #0e6895;" class="mcFormatColor">15</span>]</a> for different classes of assays, corresponding to filter C, filter B, and filter A, respectively). To load a filter from outside the project, click <span class="GUI">Import</span>. A file selector opens, in which you can navigate to and choose the filter file (<code>.flt</code>). </p>
        <p>The filter can be applied to the current view, or the results can be stored as a new view. If you select <span class="GUI">New view</span>, the <span class="GUI">Save Custom View</span> dialog box opens when you apply the filter, so that you can name and describe the view. </p>
        <p>To apply the filter, click <span class="GUI">Run</span>. If you have not saved the filter, you are prompted to save it. If you click <span class="GUI">Yes</span>, the <span class="GUI">Save Custom View</span> dialog box opens; if you click <span class="GUI">No</span>, the filter is applied without saving it. If <span class="GUI">Highlight Matches</span> is selected on the <span class="GUI">Structure</span> menu, the substructures are highlighted on the structures that match.</p>
