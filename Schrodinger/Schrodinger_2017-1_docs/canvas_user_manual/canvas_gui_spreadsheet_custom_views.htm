        <h1 class="Title">Creating and Using Custom Views of the Canvas Spreadsheet</h1>
        <p>Changes made to the view are transient: as soon as another action is taken, the previous arrangement and visibility of the rows and columns is modified. If you want to preserve a particular view of the data, you can create a <i class="UserReplace">custom view</i> that is saved in the project and can be displayed later. As well as providing a view of the data, custom views can be used to select data to run applications. </p>
        <p>To <b>create</b> a custom view, choose <span class="GUI">View </span>→<span class="GUI"> Save As</span>, or click the <span class="GUI">Save View</span> toolbar button. </p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="save_view.png" style="margin: 2px;" />
        </p>
        <p>The <span class="GUI">Save Custom View</span> dialog box opens, and you can name the view and provide a description. The view can be based on all rows that are visible in the parent view (<span class="GUI">Use all rows</span>), or the selected rows (<span class="GUI">Use selected rows</span>). When you create the view, you can choose to display it immediately by selecting <span class="GUI">Open view</span>. The named view is stored in the project and is listed under the <span class="GUI">View</span> node in the <span class="GUI">Project View</span> panel, and on menus in application panels. </p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="save_custom_view.png" style="margin: 2px;" />
        </p>
        <p>Once you have created a custom view, you can work in this view to run queries, filter the data, and create charts. However, you cannot change the data in a custom view: this must be done in the <i class="UserReplace">master view</i>, which is the view of the data shown in the main window.</p>
        <p>If you want to <b>rename</b> a custom view, you can do so in the <span class="GUI">Project View</span> panel. Expand the <span class="GUI">View</span> node, right-click on the view and choose <span class="GUI">Rename View</span>. The <span class="GUI">Save Custom View</span> dialog box opens, and you can enter a new name and change the description. If the view is open, it is closed before renaming. </p>
        <p>If you want to <b>examine</b> or change the description of the view, choose <span class="GUI">View </span>→<span class="GUI"> Details. </span>The <span class="GUI">Details</span> panel for the view opens, and displays the name, description, row and column count, and information on the time it was created, last saved, and last modified. You can edit the description in this panel.</p>
        <p>Custom views can be <b>opened</b> by choosing <span class="GUI">View </span>→<span class="GUI"> Open</span>. This action opens a dialog box, in which you can select the view that you want to open. Another way to open a custom view is to expand the <span class="GUI">View</span> node in the <span class="GUI">Project View</span> panel, and double-click the desired view, or right-click it and choose <span class="GUI">Open</span>. The tool tip for the view shows its description. </p>
        <p>Custom views are always opened in a <b>separate window</b>. This window is a reduced version of the main window: the menu bar does not have the <span class="GUI">Applications</span> and <span class="GUI">Project</span> menus, the <span class="GUI">File</span> menu only has export items, and the <span class="GUI">Project View</span> and <span class="GUI">Messages View</span> windows are absent. The absence of these components reflects the fact that the custom view is intended for viewing and rearranging the data, but not making changes in the data. </p>
        <p>Changes that you make to a custom view are not automatically saved. To <b>save</b> a custom view, choose <span class="GUI">View </span>→<span class="GUI"> Save</span> in the custom view window. You can also save a custom view as a new custom view, in the same way as from the master view. </p>
        <p>You can <b>undo</b> changes to the view, by choosing <span class="GUI">View </span>→<span class="GUI"> Undo</span> change or <span class="GUI">View </span>→<span class="GUI"> Undo All View Changes</span>. The latter operation undoes changes back to the last time the view was saved. </p>
        <p>When you have finished working in a view, you can <b>close</b> it by choosing <span class="GUI">View </span>→<span class="GUI"> Close</span>. If you no longer want to keep the view, choose <span class="GUI">View </span>→<span class="GUI"> Delete</span> to <b>delete</b> it, or right-click on its name in the <span class="GUI">Project View</span> and choose <span class="GUI">Delete</span>. </p>
        <p>To <b>sort</b> the list of views that is displayed in the <span class="GUI">Project View</span> panel and in application menus, right-click on the <span class="GUI">View</span> node, choose <span class="GUI">Sort</span>, then choose a direction, from <span class="GUI">Ascending</span>, <span class="GUI">Descending</span>, or <span class="GUI">Default</span>. The first two items sort the views in alphabetical order; the last restores the default order, which is the order the views were created.</p>
        <p>If you want to run <b>applications</b> from the command line with the rows in a custom view, you can <b>export</b> the row IDs for the view by choosing <span class="GUI">View </span>→<span class="GUI"> Export Row IDs</span>. The binary file that is written can then be used in conjunction with the project to run an application on the rows in the view. If you run a command line job that generates new properties with <code>canvasJob</code> (see <a class="TopicLink MCXref xref xrefTopicLink" href="../canvas_command_reference/canvas_command_canvasJob.htm#canvas_command_2298859567_16938">
            canvasJob</a>), you should choose <span class="GUI">View </span>→<span class="GUI"> Refresh</span> to view the new properties.</p>
        <p>Custom views can also be created from the results of an <b>application</b>. These views have a <span class="GUI">File</span> menu, for exporting the view; a <span class="GUI">View</span> menu, from which you can apply the view to the master, save the view in the project and manage properties; and a <span class="GUI">Structure</span> menu with items for the scaling and visibility of the structures. These views show only the structures by default, but properties can be added by choosing <span class="GUI">View </span>→<span class="GUI"> Manage Properties</span> and selecting properties. Once you have selected a property, this property is added to the view whenever you open a view of the results of that application. The topics listed below describe some operations you can do with a custom view.</p>
