        <h1 class="Title">Exporting Structures and Data from Canvas Projects</h1>
        <p>Canvas provides several ways of exporting structures and data. You can export the selected rows (rows in which all columns are selected) to a file or to Maestro. You can also copy and paste from Canvas into a spreadsheet. Properties are exported in the order in which they appear in the view, so you can rearrange the properties in the view into the order you want them to appear in the file before exporting. </p>
        <p>To export structures and properties to a file, choose <span class="GUI">File </span>→<span class="GUI"> Export</span>, or click the <span class="GUI">Export</span> toolbar button. </p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Toolbuttons/export.png" style="margin-left: 2px;margin-right: 2px;margin-top: 2px;margin-bottom: 2px;" />
        </p>
        <p>A file selector opens, in which you can navigate to a location, choose the format, and name the file. The supported file formats are:</p>
        <ul class="ListCompact">
            <li value="1">Maestro, compressed or uncompressed (<code>.mae</code>, <code>.mae.gz</code>, <code>.maegz</code>) 
    </li>
            <li value="2">SD file, compressed or uncompressed (<code>.sd</code>, <code>.sdf</code>, <code>.sd.gz</code>, <code>.sdf.gz</code>) 
    </li>
            <li value="3">CSV file with SMILES strings and properties (<code>.csv</code>) 
    </li>
            <li value="4">SMILES file with SMILES strings and optional titles (<code>.smi</code>). 
    </li>
            <li value="5">Fingerprint file (<code>.fp</code>).
    </li>
        </ul>
        <p>When you click <span class="GUI">Export</span>, the <span class="GUI">Export Options</span> dialog box opens. This dialog box allows you to select the properties and fingerprints to export, and set various options. When you dismiss this dialog box, the export starts, and the progress of the export is shown in the status bar, at the bottom of the main panel. There is also a button you can use to stop the export operation (and discard the results).</p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="../GeneratedImages/Equations/Equation10.svg" alt="" class="_MCEquation_0 mcReset" />
        </p>
        <p>All properties are initially selected for export. If you want to export a random subset of the rows, select <span class="GUI">Export random subset</span>, and specify the desired number of rows in the box. You can also specify the random number seed, by entering it in the <span class="GUI">Seed</span> text box, or clicking <span class="GUI">Generate Seed</span>.</p>
        <p>If you are exporting to a structure file, you can export the coordinates as 2D coordinates by selecting <span class="GUI">Force 2D coordinates</span>. When you do so, you can choose one of the three options for exporting hydrogens: <span class="GUI">Suppress hydrogens</span>, <span class="GUI">Export polar hydrogens only</span>, or <span class="GUI">Export all hydrogens</span>. The default is to export only polar hydrogens. If the file is an SD file, you can choose to export in the newer version 3.0 format by selecting <span class="GUI">Use MDL version 3.0 format for SD files</span>.</p>
        <p>If you are exporting to a SMILES or CSV file, the default is to export unique (canonical) SMILES. To export a SMILES string that depends on the order of the atoms in the structure (first atom in the structure is first in the SMILES string), deselect <span class="GUI">Export unique SMILES</span>.</p>
        <p>The structures in a Canvas project have a unique identifier (UID), which can be exported by selecting <span class="GUI">Export Canvas UIDs</span>. Exporting the UIDs allows you to add or change properties for the structures that you export, and then ensure that these properties are associated with the correct structures when you reimport them into the Canvas project. </p>
        <p>If you want to scale the properties so that they have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, you can do so by selecting <span class="GUI">Autoscale properties</span>. This can be useful when exporting properties to other applications that require automatically scaled variables. If you want to scale only some of the properties rather than all properties exported, select them in the <span class="GUI">Selected properties</span> list.</p>
        <p>Fingerprints can be exported for two choices of file format: a CSV file (SMILES+Properties) or a binary file (Fingerprint, <code>.fp</code>). When you choose either of these file formats, the <span class="GUI">Export fingerprint</span> option is available in the <span class="GUI">Export Options</span> dialog box, and you can select this option to export fingerprints and choose the fingerprint to export. To display options for exporting the fingerprints, click <span class="GUI">Fingerprint Options</span>. </p>
        <p>You can decide whether to export all bits or the most significant <i class="UserReplace">n</i> bits. By default, all bits are exported to a binary file, but only the most informative 200 bits are exported to a CSV file. This is because each bit in the fingerprint is stored as a separate property in the CSV file, with values of 0 or 1. The prefix for naming these properties can be entered in the <span class="GUI">Prefix for bit columns</span> text box, which is absent if exporting to a binary file. </p>
        <p>Another alternative is to export a set of bits that has previously been stored (a “bit set”). A bit set stores information on which bits were chosen for a given fingerprint to form the set, and thus indirectly stores information on the features that these bits represent. One reason for choosing a stored bit set is for consistency on export. The most informative 200 bits for one set of molecules might not be the most informative for another set, so if you export the most informative bits, the exported fingerprints will not have information about the same features in the molecules. You can avoid this discrepancy by exporting a saved bit set. </p>
        <p>To use a bit set from the project, select <span class="GUI">Use saved bit set</span>, and choose the bit set from the option menu. This menu lists saved bit sets for the fingerprint you are exporting. To use a bit set from a file, select <span class="GUI">Import bit set from external file</span>, and click <span class="GUI">Browse</span> to navigate to the file, or enter the file name in the text box. When you choose either of these options, the options to export all or the most significant bits are not available. </p>
        <p>If you choose to export all or the most significant bits, the bit set that you use to export the fingerprint is saved in the project with the fingerprint, and can also be saved in an external file. <span class="GUI">Save bit set</span> is automatically selected and you can enter a name for the bit set in the text box. The bit set is then saved in the project. To save it in an external file as well, select <span class="GUI">Export to file</span>, and click <span class="GUI">Browse</span> to navigate to the file, or enter the file name in the text box. </p>
        <p>To export structures and properties from a Canvas project directly to Maestro, choose <span class="GUI">File </span>→<span class="GUI"> Export to Maestro</span>. The structures and properties are exported from the Canvas project to a temporary Maestro file, then Maestro is started and the file contents are imported. </p>
        <p>To copy rows or columns from Canvas to a spreadsheet program, such as Microsoft Excel or Open Office Calc, simply select the rows or columns and copy them to the clipboard with <span class="Keys">CTRL+C</span> (⌘<span class="Keys">C</span>) or <span class="GUI">Edit </span>→<span class="GUI"> Copy</span>. You can then paste them into the chosen application. </p>
