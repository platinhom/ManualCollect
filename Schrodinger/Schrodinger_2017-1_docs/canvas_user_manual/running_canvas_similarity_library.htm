        <h1 class="Title">Hole-Filling and Library Optimization in Canvas</h1>
        <p>If you want to choose a set of compounds based on their dissimilarity and optionally by optimizing the values of a set of properties, you can do so with in the <span class="GUI">Hole-Filling and Library Optimization</span> dialog box, which you open from the <span class="GUI">Applications</span> menu. With this application you can choose a set of dissimilar structures from a pool, and you can use them to fill holes in an existing library. Like <span class="GUI">Diversity-Based Selection</span>, this application uses nearest-neighbor distances to choose the most diverse structures, but with a different approach. Here, the desired number of structures is selected at random, and then the similarity of the structures to each other and to the library is minimized. In addition, the process can be guided by selection of structures whose properties lie in specified ranges. This is done by minimizing the fraction of properties for each selected structure whose values lie outside the ranges.</p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="hole_filling_library_optimization.png" style="margin: 2px;" />
        </p>
        <p>The structure pool can be chosen from selected or visible rows in the master view, a saved view, or the data set from a previous run, and the results are saved with a name that you can specify. If you want to use the selected rows, you must select them before opening the dialog box. </p>
        <p>If you select <span class="GUI">Hole-filling</span>, the library whose holes are to be filled is taken from a saved view, which you can choose. It is best to ensure that the structure pool and the library do not have structures in common. The similarity matrix is computed from fingerprints, which you can select from those already available in the project.</p>
        <p>If you want to optimize the values of properties, select <span class="GUI">Optimize properties</span>, and click <span class="GUI">Properties</span> to choose the properties and set the desired ranges. To save the property set and their ranges as a property filter, click <span class="GUI">Export Filter</span>. Filters can be imported (<span class="GUI">Import</span>) or read from another job (<span class="GUI">Use filter from</span>).</p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="hole_filling_library_optimization_properties.png" style="margin: 2px;" />
        </p>
        <p>You can optimize properties without filling holes in a library, but the structures are still selected by minimizing their similarity to one another.</p>
        <p>When you have specified the structures and set options, including the number of structures to select, click <span class="GUI">Run</span>. The time taken scales as the square of the number of structures selected, so selecting a large number of structures could take some time. If you want to set parameters to control the optimization process, click <span class="GUI">Advanced Options</span>. In the dialog box that opens, you can set the maximum number of optimization cycles, thresholds for stopping the optimization, a limit on the run time, the random seed for selecting structures and other aspects of the optimization, and a threshold for a simulated annealing process used when the score used in the optimization increases.
