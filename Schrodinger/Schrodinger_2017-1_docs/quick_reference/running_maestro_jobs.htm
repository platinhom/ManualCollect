        <h1 class="Title">Starting Jobs from Maestro</h1>
        <p>To run a job from Maestro, you open a panel from one of the menus (e.g. <span class="GUI">Tasks</span>), make settings, and then submit the job to a host or a queueing system for execution. The panel settings are described in the help topics and in the user manuals. When you have finished making settings, you can use the Job toolbar to start the job. </p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Toolbuttons/panel_job_toolbar.png" style="margin-left: 2px;margin-right: 2px;margin-top: 2px;margin-bottom: 2px;" />
        </p>
        <p>You can start a job immediately by clicking <span class="GUI">Run</span>. The job is run on the currently selected host with the current job settings and the job name in the <span class="GUI">Job name</span> text box. If you want to change the job name, you can edit it in the text box before starting the job. Details of the job settings are reported in the status bar, which is below the Job toolbar. </p>
        <p>If you want to change the job settings, such as the host on which to run the job and the number of processors to use, click the <span class="GUI">Settings</span> button. (You can also click the arrow next to the button and choose <span class="GUI">Job Settings</span> from the menu that is displayed.)</p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Toolbuttons/settings.png" style="margin-left: 2px;margin-right: 2px;margin-top: 2px;margin-bottom: 2px;" />
        </p>
        <p>You can then make the settings in the <span class="GUI">Job Settings</span> dialog box (usually named <i class="UserReplace">task</i>&#160;<span class="GUI">â€“&#160;Job Settings)</span>, and choose to just save the settings by clicking <span class="GUI">OK</span>, or save the settings and start the job by clicking <span class="GUI">Run</span>. These settings apply only to jobs that are started from the current panel. This feature allows you to make job settings before making calculation settings, for example. </p>
        <p>If you want to save the input files for the job but not run it, click the <span class="GUI">Settings</span> button and choose <span class="GUI">Write</span>. A dialog box opens in which you can provide the job name, which is used to name the files. The files are written to the current working directory.</p>
        <p>The <span class="GUI">Settings</span> button also allows you to change the panel settings. You can choose <span class="GUI">Read</span>, to read settings from an input file for the job and apply them to the panel, or you can choose <span class="GUI">Reset Panel</span> to reset all the panel settings to their default values.</p>
        <p>You can also set preferences for all jobs and how the interface interacts with the job at various stages. This is done in the <span class="GUI">Preferences</span> panel, which you can open at the <span class="GUI">Jobs</span> section by choosing <span class="GUI">Preferences</span> from the <span class="GUI">Settings</span> button menu.</p>
        <p class="Note" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; "><span class="autonumber"><span><b>Note:</b> <![CDATA[ ]]></span></span>The items present on the <span class="GUI">Settings</span> menu can vary with the application. The descriptions above cover all of the items.</p>
        <p>The icon on the <span class="GUI">Job Status</span> button shows the status of jobs for the application that belong to the current project. It starts spinning when the first job is successfully launched, and stops spinning when the last job finishes. It changes to an exclamation point if a job is not launched successfully.</p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Toolbuttons/job_status.png" style="margin-left: 2px;margin-right: 2px;margin-top: 2px;margin-bottom: 2px;" />
        </p>
        <p>Clicking the button shows a small job status window that lists the job name and status for all active jobs submitted for the application from the current project, and a summary message at the bottom. The rows are colored according to the status: yellow for submitted, green for launched, running, or finished, red for incorporated, died, or killed. You can double-click on a row to open the <span class="GUI">Monitor</span> panel and monitor the job, or click the <span class="GUI">Monitor</span> button to open the <span class="GUI">Monitor</span> panel and close the job status window. The job status is updated while the window is open. If a job finishes while the window is open, the job remains displayed but with the new status. Click anywhere outside the window to close it. </p>
        <p>Jobs are run under the Job Control facility, which manages the details of starting the job, transferring files, checking on status, and so on. For more information about this facility and how it operates, as well as details of the <span class="GUI">Job Settings</span> dialog box, see the <a class="Manual MCXref xref xrefManual" href="../job_control/job_controlTOC.htm#job_controltoc_4099964329_71112">Job Control Guide</a>.</p>
