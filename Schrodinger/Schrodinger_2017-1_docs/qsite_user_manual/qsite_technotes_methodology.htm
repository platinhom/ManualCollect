        <h1 class="Title">How QSite Works</h1>
        <p>Most approaches for developing robust and accurate QM/MM methods have been based on “link atom” approaches, in which QM and MM fragments are capped by hydrogens. These methods face nontrivial problems in constructing an accurate description of the QM/MM interface, particularly for polar systems, where the treatment of electrostatic interactions can be highly problematic. While this method is available in QSite, QSite also takes an alternative approach in which frozen localized molecular orbitals are used to build the QM/MM interface. This methodology has recently been reviewed favorably <a class="Reference_Number MCXref xref xrefReference_Number" href="qsite_references.htm#qsite_technotes_467258911_743820">[<span style="color: #0e6895;" class="mcFormatColor">3</span>]</a>. As far as we are aware, QSite is the first ab initio frozen-orbital methodology with analytical gradients for which accuracy for structures and conformational energetics of a polar system has been demonstrated. </p>
        <p>The details of QSite’s frozen-orbital interface technology is provided in References <a class="Ref_Number_Only MCXref xref xrefRef_Number_Only" href="qsite_references.htm#qsite_technotes_467258911_743822">4</a>-<a class="Ref_Number_Only MCXref xref xrefRef_Number_Only" href="qsite_references.htm#qsite_technotes_467258911_743825">6</a> at the end of this chapter. The key aspects are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p class="ListPara">The frozen orbital itself is obtained by Boys localization of the quantum chemical wavefunction for one of a series of small template molecules. The orbital must be translated and rotated as the molecular geometry changes, and its interaction with both the QM and MM regions must be properly represented. The charge distribution must be empirically corrected to reproduce the fully quantum chemical result. QSite does this by placing a charge in the middle of the frozen bond. QSite not only includes appropriate energy expressions for this representation but also the analytical gradients that are critical to applications that involve geometry optimization.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p class="ListPara">The QM and MM regions interact via two mechanisms: Coulomb interaction between MM charges and the QM wavefunction, and van der Waals interaction between QM and MM atoms (both of which employ van der Waals parameters).</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p class="ListPara">Specialized correction terms are used for stretches, bends, and torsions involving the atoms directly associated with the frozen-orbital interface. These terms are fit to reproduce quantum-chemical conformational energies of the template molecules. Again, QSite has gradients for all of these terms as well as energy expressions.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The torsional correction parameters were determined from a library of high-quality QM calculations on rotamer states for dipeptides. Beginning with roughly 300 geometries obtained via conformational search using OPLS-AA, the structures were optimized at the HF/6-31G** level and single point LMP2/cc-pVTZ (-f) relative energies were computed. Finally, one-dimensional torsional profiles were generated at the same level of theory for all minima and relevant torsional degrees of freedom (~2000 QM data points in all). Alanine tetrapeptide conformations, generated via the same protocol, were used to test transferability. In addition, a database consisting of hydrogen-bonded pairs of small-molecule side-chain analogues was constructed. About 200 such pairs were used to determine van der Waals radii for QM atoms that yield accurate hydrogen bonding energetics between QM and MM donors and acceptors. These data sets are considerably more extensive, and of higher quality, than any that have been used previously in developing or testing QM/MM models of peptides and proteins. </p>
        <p>Both DFT and Hartree-Fock parameter sets have been developed. The LMP2 version of the theory has been implemented for use in “single-point” calculations. It has not yet been fully parameterized, but can be used to compare structures and energies when there is little change in the protein geometry in the vicinity of the frozen orbital interfaces. Details of the parameter optimization methodology are provided in the previously cited references. </p>
        <p>QSite makes use of a tight coupling between Jaguar and Impact. Key features of the implementation are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p class="ListPara">QSite adiabatically minimizes the MM region after each QM geometry step. Without this, the number of QM steps would become prohibitively large and would place the calculations out of range for all but the most powerful supercomputers. </p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p class="ListPara">QSite can run the rate-limiting QM part of the code on parallel processors so that reasonable throughput can be achieved for the relatively large (100–200 atom) QM regions that can be necessary to reliably model active-site reactive chemistry. </p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p class="ListPara">QSite incorporates a Poisson-Boltzmann continuum-dielectric treatment of aqueous solvation. This treatment is capable of handling the QM and MM regions simultaneously and includes an analytic gradient, so that geometry optimization in solution can be performed. Inclusion of solvation will be critical in some (but not all) applications, an obvious case being calculation of p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> values of ionizable protein side chains or of ligand groups that interact with the protein.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Maestro makes it easy to set up a QSite calculation. For example, its QSite interface can be used to readily identify the QM residues of the protein via mouse clicks, and to specify whether the QM/MM “cut” is to be placed in the backbone or side chain. The 6-31G* basis set is used in the interface region, but other basis sets can be used elsewhere. For example, the geometry can be optimized with the 6-31G* basis set, and a large, high quality basis set can then be used in a reactive region to determine accurate single-point energies. We have used this strategy very successfully in our QM-based modeling of the protein methane monooxygenase <a class="Reference_Number MCXref xref xrefReference_Number" href="qsite_references.htm#qsite_technotes_467258911_743827">[<span style="color: #0e6895;" class="mcFormatColor">7</span>]</a> and expect it to work for a wide range of active-site modeling applications. </p>
