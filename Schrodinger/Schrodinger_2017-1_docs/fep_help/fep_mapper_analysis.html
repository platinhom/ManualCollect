        <p>Analyze the results of FEP calculations generated from an FEP map to produce estimates of the relative free energies for the perturbations and binding free energies for the ligands.</p>
        <p class="opening">To open this panel, choose <span class="GUI">Tasks → Free Energy Perturbation → FEP Mapper Analysis</span> in the Task Tool.</p>
        <h2><a name="using"></a>Using the FEP Mapper Analysis Panel</h2>
        <p>The purpose of this panel is to analyze the results of sets FEP Mapper or FEP Scanning jobs. On the computational side, it provides tools for assessing the error in the predicted ΔΔG values by examining the hysteresis around loops and assessing the accuracy by comparison with experimental ΔG values.</p>
        <p>On the lead optimization side, the ΔΔG values provide information on the effect of a functional group substitution at a site on the binding affinity. This in turn can be used to direct the choice of compounds for synthesis or generate ideas for further compounds to test.</p>
        <h4>Error Estimates</h4>
        <p>The errors in the cycle-closure-corrected estimates of ΔΔG are calculated as follows. (Combined errors are evaluated as usual by quadratic combination.)</p>
        <p>For each pair of ligands that are directly connected (by an edge in the graph), the hysteresis is evaluated for each loop involving that edge, and the error for each loop <i>k</i> is evaluated as</p>
        <p>error<sub>k</sub> = hysteresis<sub><i>k</i></sub>/√<i>N<sub>k</sub></i></p>
        <p>where <i>N<sub>k</sub></i> is the number of nodes in the loop. The error in ΔΔG for the pair of ligands is taken as the maximum loop error.</p>
        <p>For each pair of ligands that are not directly connected, the error is evaluated for each loop that contains the two ligands, and the error in ΔΔG is taken to be that of the loop with the smallest error. The error around a loop is evaluated by using the expression above for the error in each edge of the loop.</p>
        <p>See <a href="../fep_user_manual/fep_methodology_cycle_closure.htm" class="MCXref xref" xrefformat="{paratext}">FEP Cycle Closure Method and Error Estimates</a> for a more detailed explanation.</p>
        <p>To estimate the ΔG for each ligand, some experimental binding free energies are required. The predicted binding free energy is estimated as</p>
        <p>ΔG<sub>j</sub>(pred) = (1/<i>M</i>) Σ<sub>k</sub> [ ΔG<sub>k</sub>(exp) − ΔΔG<sub>kj</sub> ]</p>
        <p>where there are <i>M</i> experimental binding free energies over which the sum is performed. The prediction is just the average of the values obtained by using each experimental value as a reference. Similarly, the predicted error is taken by combining the errors for each experimental value used and dividing by the number of experimental values:</p>
        <p>e<sub>j</sub>(pred) = (1/<i>M</i>) √ Σ<sub>k</sub> e<sub>kj</sub>(pred)<sup>2</sup></p>
        <p>where e<sub>kj</sub>(pred) is the error in the prediction of the binding free energy from the use of a single experimental value <i>k</i> as reference,
e<sub>kj</sub>(pred)<sup>2</sup> = e<sub>k</sub>(exp)<sup>2</sup> + e<sub>kj</sub>(ΔΔG)<sup>2</sup>. </p>
        <p>See <a href="../fep_user_manual/fep_methodology_deltaG.htm" class="MCXref xref" xrefformat="{paratext}">Conversion of ΔΔG Values to ΔG Values</a> for a more detailed explanation.</p>
        <p>By default the experimental error e<sub>k</sub>(exp) is taken to be 0.4 kcal/mol, and e<sub>kj</sub>(ΔΔG) is the error in the predicted relative binding free energy for ligands <i>k</i> and <i>j</i>.</p>

        <h3><a name="feature1"></a>Import button</h3>
        <p>To import a perturbation map from a file, click this button. A file selector opens, in which you can navigate to and open the FEP map file (<code>.fmp</code> or <code>out.pkl</code>).</p>
        <p>You can import more than one map at a time, by selecting multiple files in the file selector, or by clicking <span class="GUI">Import</span> for each map. The results from each imported map are merged into a single graph. There must be common ligands so that the map can be merged into a single map. If this is not the case, an error message is displayed and the import is canceled.</p>
        <p>If you want to examine a new map rather than merging maps, click <span class="GUI">Reset</span> first, then import the new map.</p>

        <p>This button has a menu that allows you to export the map to a file, export an image of the map to a PDF file, or export the table data to a CSV file or an Excel spreadsheet.</p>
        <h3><a name="reset"></a>Reset button</h3>
        <p>Clear all data from the panel and reset it to its default state. Use this button if you want to replace the existing map with another map, rather than merge the results.</p>
        <h3><a name="feature7"></a>Display Edge ΔΔG button</h3>
        <p>This button has a menu from which you can choose to display the ΔΔG values on the edges of the graph: the raw (Bennet) predicted values, the (cycle closure) corrected predictions, and the experimental values. The values are color-coded, with the experiment in black, the raw predictions in blue and the corrected predictions in red.</p>
        <h3><a name="feature6"></a>Map display area</h3>
        <p>This area displays the perturbation graph.</p>
        <p>You can drag the ligands to reposition them on the graph.</p>
        <p>You can zoom in or out with the scroll wheel or use the + and - buttons at the top left of the display area. When zoomed out, the ligands are represented by a number in a box. As you zoom in, the number is replaced by the 2d structure when the resolution is high enough to display it. Double-clicking on a connection zooms in to that connection.</p>
        <p>When you pause the pointer over a ligand, the parts of the graph to which it is not connected are dimmed. When zoomed out, the 2D structures are also displayed in a tooltip.</p>
        <p>Right-clicking on a connection displays a menu, with three items, <span class="GUI">Quick View</span>, <span class="GUI">Analyze</span>, and <span class="GUI">Delete</span>. The first of these, <span class="GUI">Quick View</span>, displays a panel at the bottom of the display area that contains the 2D structures for the connection, with tools for annotating the structures:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1"><span class="GUI">Mutation</span>—highlight the mutation. The mutated atoms are marked with red circles and the changed bonds are colored red.</li>
            <li value="2"><span class="GUI">Atom mapping</span>—Show the atom numbering on the structures.</li>
            <li value="3"><span class="GUI">Common core</span>—Mark the common core with green bonds.</li>

            <li value="5"><span class="GUI">None</span>—Show the structures without any annotation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The second item, <span class="GUI">Analyze</span>, opens a panel with a more detailed analysis of the perturbation, including plots of data as a function of simulation time and analyses of protein-ligand interactions.
