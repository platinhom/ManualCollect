        <p>Create excluded volumes for a Phase hypothesis in regions occupied by atoms in a set of inactives that do not overlap with atoms in a set of actives. The actives and inactives must be prealigned to the hypothesis for which the excluded volumes are created.</p>
        <p>To open this dialog box, click <span class="GUI">Inactives and Actives</span> in the <span class="GUI">Manage Excluded Volumes</span> panel.</p>
        <h2><a name="using"></a>Using the Excluded Volumes from Inactives and Actives Dialog Box</h2>
        <p>The basis of this procedure for generating excluded volumes is that any region of space in which inactives have atoms but actives do not corresponds to a region that is not favored for activity. These are considered to be "clashes". The reason might be that the region has a receptor side chain that has to be moved out of the way, or that there are solvent molecules in this region that incur a penalty for replacement, or that there are unfavorable interactions with the receptor in this region. There are, of course, other reasons why molecules are inactive (or poor binders): for example, they might be missing a critical pharmacophore feature. When choosing the inactives, therefore, it is a good idea to choose those inactives that match all features in the hypothesis. The choice of actives should be as structurally diverse as possible, to avoid placing excluded volumes in regions that have no effect on activity (such as non-critical solvent regions).</p>
        <p>You must ensure that the actives and inactives are aligned to the pharmacophore hypothesis. You can use the <a href="ligand_screening.html" class="MCXref xref" xrefformat="{paratext}">Phase Ligand Screening Panel</a> with the actives and the inactives, and use the hit file for the aligned ligands, or use the <code>phase_find_matches</code> utility.</p>
        <p>If you are adding excluded volumes from the <span class="GUI">Develop Common Pharmacophore Hypotheses </span> panel, you must export the actives and the inactives from the <span class="GUI">Alignments</span> table. You can right-click and choose <span class="GUI">Export Alignments to Project Table</span>. You can then select the desired actives in the Project Table, and export them, and likewise with the desired inactives. You should consider actives and inactives that are not part of the pharm set, in the light of the discussion above.</p>
