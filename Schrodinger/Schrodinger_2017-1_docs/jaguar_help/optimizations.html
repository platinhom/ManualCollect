        <h2><a name="jgeopt1"></a>Overview</h2>
        <p>To perform a geometry optimization, you need a guess at the geometry and the direction in which to search, a set of coordinates to optimize, and some criteria for when the optimization is complete. The search direction is obtained from the gradient of the energy and the initial Hessian. The general settings for geometry optimizations are in the <span class="GUI">Optimization</span> tab of the <span class="GUI">Jaguar</span> panel.</p>
        <p>Jaguar can use several coordinate systems for the geometry optimization parameters: Cartesian coordinates, Z-matrix coordinates, or redundant internal coordinates. The last of these is the default, and is usually the best coordinate system for the optimization. You should use redundant internal coordinates unless you have a good reason not to.</p>
        <p>Jaguar also provides several choices for the initial Hessian. The default Schlegel guess is usually sufficient for most optimizations. If the molecule has unusual features or is a floppy molecule, you can compute an accurate Hessian at the beginning of the optimization, or read it in.</p>
        <p>For large molecules, especially if there are low-frequency vibrational modes, convergence can be slow. It is often useful to optimize the molecule in stages, with parts of the molecule frozen. You can freeze as many coordinates as you wish, and you can also apply dynamic constraints, in which a target value is set for a particular coordinate that is achieved at convergence. Dynamic constraints on a coordinate are useful when a change in the coordinate value to a fixed value would cause unfavorable interactions in other parts of the molecule, or would prevent the optimization from proceeding to the minimum.</p>
        <p>In addition to optimizing the ground state of a molecule, you can optimize to the first excited state of any symmetry. If the spin or spatial symmetry is different from that of the ground state, you only need to set the symmetry and ensure that the orbital occupation is appropriate. If the symmetry is the same as the ground state, you can use TDDFT to optimize the first excited state (by selecting<span class="GUI"> Optimize first excited state (TDDFT)</span> in the <span class="GUI">Theory</span> tab of the <span class="GUI">Jaguar</span> panel.</p>
        <h2><a name="jgeopt3"></a>Running Geometry Optimizations</h2>
        <p>To set up a geometry optimization from Maestro, choose <span class="GUI">Tasks → Quantum Mechanics → Optimization</span>, 
<span class="GUI">Tasks → Quantum Mechanics → Optimization</span>, or 
<span class="GUI">Tasks → Quantum Mechanics → Optimization</span>.</p>
        <p>In the <span class="GUI">Optimization</span> tab, you can set parameters for the maximum number of steps in the geometry optimization, the convergence accuracy, and you can choose an initial Hessian and a coordinate system. If you do not need to add constraints, once you have made these settings, and any settings in the other tabs, you can click <span class="GUI">Run</span> to start the job with the current job settings.</p>
        <p>You can add constraints with the controls in the <span class="GUI">Add New Constraint</span> section, by picking atoms in the Workspace to define the coordinates.</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">Choose the coordinate type - <span class="GUI">Angle</span>, <span class="GUI">Cartesian</span>, <span class="GUI">Dihedral</span>, or <span class="GUI">Distance</span> - from the <span class="GUI">Type</span> option menu.</li>
            <li value="2">Choose <span class="GUI">Atoms</span> or <span class="GUI">Bonds</span> from the <span class="GUI">Pick</span> option menu</li>
            <li value="3">Pick the required number of atoms or bonds in the Workspace to define the coordinate.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The coordinate and its type is listed in the <span class="GUI">Constraints</span> table. If you choose Cartesian, you can choose which combination of coordinates (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, or <i>z</i>) to freeze from the <span class="GUI">Constrain in</span> option menu. You can add all distance, angle. or dihedral constraints by clicking the appropriate <span class="GUI">Add All</span> button.</p>
        <p>Distance, angle, and dihedral constraints are added as internal coordinates to a <b>coord</b> section, with a # sign to indicate that the coordinate is frozen. Cartesian coordinate constraints are added to the <b>zmat</b> section, by adding a # sign after the constrained coordinates.</p>
        <p>To make a constraint in the <span class="GUI">Constraints</span> table dynamic, select the table row, then select <span class="GUI">Dynamic</span> in the <span class="GUI">Selected constraint</span> section next to the table and enter the value that you want the constraint to converge on in the <span class="GUI">Target value</span> text box. This value is copied to the <span class="GUI">Target</span> column of the table, and added to the variable definition in the coord section.</p><a name="jgeopt5"></a> <h2><a name="links"></a>Related Topics</h2><ul><li value="1"><a href="jaguar_panel.html" class="MCXref xref" xrefformat="{paratext}">Jaguar Panel</a></li><li value="2"><a href="optimization_tab.html" class="MCXref xref" xrefformat="{paratext}">Jaguar Panel — Optimization Tab</a></li></ul></body>
