        <h1>Reaction Energetics</h1>
        <p>Calculating a reaction enthalpy involves calculations on each of the individual molecules in the reaction, then taking the difference. Jaguar provides a convenient way of doing this calculation directly. In the <span class="GUI">Jaguar - Reaction</span> panel, you can specify the reactant and product molecules, and Jaguar performs all the individual calculations and then calculates the reaction enthalpy.</p>
        <p>To open the <span class="GUI">Reaction</span> panel, choose <span class="GUI">Tasks → Quantum Mechanics → Reaction</span> in the Task Tool. The <span class="GUI">Jaguar - Reaction</span> panel opens with the <span class="GUI">Reaction</span> tab displayed. This tab is used to choose the structures for the reaction.</p>
        <p>The <span class="GUI">Reaction</span> tab has two sections, one for reactants and one for products. Each section shows the structures, in separate boxes. Initially there is only one box in each section and they are empty. To add a reactant or a product structure to a box, click in the box and choose the source of the structure:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p><span class="GUI">Import from Project Table</span>—import the structure from the Project Table. A <span class="GUI">Choose Entry</span> dialog box opens, so you can choose the entry.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>Import from File—import the structure from a Maestro file. If the file has more than one structure, only the first is imported.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>When the structure is imported, a 2D image is displayed in the box, and is labeled <span class="GUI">Reactant</span><i>N</i> or <span class="GUI">Product</span><i>N</i>. To display the structure in the Workspace, click in the box.</p>
        <p>To add another reactant or product, click the + button to the left of the first box in either section. Another box is displayed, and you can add a structure to it. The boxes are numbered sequentially. To delete a reactant or product, right-click in its box and choose <span class="GUI">Delete</span> from the shortcut menu. To clear the entire panel and start over, click the arrow for the <span class="GUI">Settings</span> button (gear icon at the lower right of the panel) and choose <span class="GUI">Reset Panel</span>.</p>
        <p>To display all the structures in the Workspace, click <span class="GUI">Tile in Workspace</span>. Each structure is shown in a separate tile, labeled with the entry title and the structure label (which is stored as the <span class="GUI">Jaguar Reaction ID</span> property in the project). See <a href="../maestro_workspace_help/tileentries.html">Tiling Entries</a> for more information on tiles and their features.</p>
        <p>When you have chosen all the structures, you should check that the stoichiometry is correct, otherwise the job will fail.</p>
        <p>You can set the charge, spin multiplicity, symmetry use, and basis set for each structure in the <span class="GUI">Molecules</span> tab. Choose the structure from the option menu at the top right, then make the settings. Make sure that you choose the same basis set for each molecule, and that the charge and spin multiplicity is consistent between reactants and products. The job will fail if any inconsistency is detected.</p>
        <p>The <span class="GUI">Properties</span> tab provides two options: one to calculate ΔG and ΔH, and one to pre-optimize the geometries of all the structures. If you choose to calculate ΔG and ΔH, a frequency calculation is performed for each structure.</p>
        <p>The remaining tabs allow you to control the theoretical method, SCF parameters, and solvent, and choose properties to calculate for each molecule. These tabs are described in separate topics.</p>
        <p>When you have made all the settings, you can run the job. The structures are incorporated as new entries in the project, with their properties. In addition, the ΔE, ΔG and ΔH values for the reaction are added as properties of the structures, if calculated.</p>
