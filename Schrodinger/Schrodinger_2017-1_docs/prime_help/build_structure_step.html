        <p>In this step, you build a model structure for the query based on the template chosen in the <span class="GUI">Find Homologs</span> step and aligned in the <span class="GUI">Edit Alignment</span> step.</p>
        <p>For general information on the panel, see the topic <a href="structure_prediction.html">Structure Prediction Panel</a>.</p>
        <h2><a name="using"></a>Using the Build Structure Step</h2>
        <p>The process of building a structure from one or more templates involves the following steps.</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Copying of backbone atoms for aligned regions and side chains of conserved residues</li>
            <li value="2">Optimization of side chains</li>
            <li value="3">Minimization of non-template residues</li>
            <li value="4">Building of insertions and closing of deletions in the alignment</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By default, all of these steps are performed, except that insertions of more than 20 residues are omitted. Also by default, only the protein structure is built: ligands, cofactors and waters are deleted before building. However, you can choose to leave out one or more steps (except the first), and you can choose to build in ligands and cofactors. (Water molecules must be added afterwards.) These choices must be made before you build the structure. If you are using multiple templates, you must also choose the type of model you are building: composite, consensus, homo-multimer or hetero-multimer. For composite models, you must select the regions from each template that are used to build the structure. The following sections provide more detail on the choices to be made.</p>
        <p>For details and technical information about the Build Structure step, see the <a href="../prime_user_manual/structure_prediction_build.htm">Build Structure Step</a> chapter in the <a href="../prime_user_manual/prime_user_manualTOC.htm"><i>Prime User Manual</i></a>.</p>
        <h4>Building a Composite Model</h4>
        <p>If you want to build a composite model from the templates you selected in the <a href="find_homologs_step.html"><span class="GUI">Find Homologs</span> step</a>, select <span class="GUI">Composite/Chimera</span> in the <span class="GUI">Multiple-template modle type</span> section. You must specify which template should be used for each region of the query, otherwise, the first template in the table is used for the entire query.</p>
        <p>To specify the regions to be used for each template, first select <span class="GUI">Set template regions</span> (selected by default), then select the desired region on each template in the Sequence Viewer. When you begin to select the template regions, only the first template is in use. As you select regions in the second template, the corresponding residues in the first template are automatically deselected. If you select regions for use from a third template, the corresponding regions of the first and second templates are deselected, and so on. Thus, the selection process ensures that only one template residue is assigned to a query residue (the most recent one selected). Regions of a template that are not used to model the query are colored dark gray (regardless of color schemes.)  </p>
        <h4>Building a Consensus Model</h4>
        <p>If you want to build a consensus model from the templates, select <span class="GUI">Consensus</span> in the <span class="GUI">Model type when using multiple templates</span> section. The model is then built from the consensus between the templates at each residue position: for example, if two templates have a loop in the same spatial region but in the third template, the loop occupies a different region, the model is built from the two that agree. The alignment is done as part of the model-building job, so there is no need to align the structures for the templates.</p>
        <h4>Building Multimers</h4>
        <p>In addition to building models for a single chain, you can build models for multimers that are composed of copies of the same chain (homomultimers) or of different chains (heteromultimers).</p>
        <p>To build homomultimers, you must have an alignment for each chain in the templatea. Often the template is another homomultimer, but it can also be a heteromultimer. The main requirement is that structures for each template chain must be in the correct spatial relation to product the multimer.</p>
        <p>To build heteromultimers, you must first model the individual units of the multimer (which can be homomultimers) in separate runs, up to this step. The templates that you choose to build the individual units must be properly aligned to each other, so that the resulting built structure has the desired configuration of the units. To build the model, click <span class="GUI">Hetero-multimers</span>, choose the runs in the <span class="GUI">Hetero-multimers Modeling</span> dialog box, and click <span class="GUI">Start</span>.</p>
        <h4>Setting Constraints</h4>
        <p>If you know that certain residues must be in close contact in the final structure, such as cysteines forming a disulfide bond, you can constrain their positions in the final model by setting proximity constraints on residue pairs. Proximity constraints can only be applied if at least one of the residues in the pair is in a loop, as helices and strands can't be adjusted to satisfy proximity constraints. A disulfide bond is formally constructed between pairs of CYS residues. To apply these constraints, select <span class="GUI">Pick residue pairs in query sequence</span>, and pick the pairs of residues that you want to be in contact in the final model. You can also apply proximity constraints between a ligand and the query, by picking a residue and a ligand.</p>
        <p>Proximity constraints are only available with the energy-based model building method.</p>
        <h4>Including Ligands and Cofactors</h4>
        <p>Cofactors and ligands that are present in the template you have chosen (except water) are listed in the <span class="GUI">Include ligands and cofactors</span> list. If you want to include any of these cofactors and ligands in the build process, select them in the list. You can use control-click and shift-click to select multiple rows. The selected ligands and cofactors are highlighted in yellow in the Workspace. By default, only the ligands and cofactors within 5&#160;Å of the chain used for the template are included in the list. To display the full list, select <span class="GUI">Show All</span>.</p>
        <h4>Choosing Options for Building</h4>
        <p>If you want to select the steps that are performed in the building process, you can do so in the <a href="build_structure_options.html"><span class="GUI">Build Structure - Options</span> dialog box</a>, which you open by clicking <span class="GUI">Options</span>.</p>
        <h4>Results of Model Building</h4>
        <p>When the model is built, the structure is automatically incorporated into the project, and the model is displayed in the Workspace. For composite and multimer models, the residues are colored according to how the template was used:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">blue—all coordinates were taken from the template</li>
            <li value="2">cyan—the backbone coordinates were taken from the template</li>
            <li value="3">red—the residue was rebuilt.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This information is stored in the Homology Status property (i_psp_Homology_Status), with values of 0, 1, and 2 respectively.</p>
        <p>The coloring of ALA and GLY residues in the model that came from other residues in the template depends on whether you clicked <span class="GUI">Preview Model</span> or <span class="GUI">Build Model</span>. These residues are colored cyan in the preview, which only indicates that they are different from the template: the coloring is based on the alignment. In the built model, these residues are colored blue, because they have no side chains and therefore all the coordinates in the built model were taken from the template.</p>
        <p>The sequence in the <span class="GUI">Structure Prediction</span> panel remains as it was before building: it reflects only the state of the sequences brought into the <span class="GUI">Build Structure</span> step. The Workspace sequence viewer displays the full sequence of the built model.</p>
