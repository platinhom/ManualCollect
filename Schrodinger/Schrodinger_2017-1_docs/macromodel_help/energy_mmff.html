        <h1>MMFF and MMFFs Force Fields</h1>
        <p>The MMFF and MMFFs force fields are all-atom models. These fields are especially useful for biopolymers (peptides and proteins). MMFF's solvation energies are reliable in both water and chloroform. MMFF assigns constant dielectric electrostatics (e = 1) by default. Extended nonbonded cutoff distances should be used for high accuracy with polar molecules. When a conformational search is being used as a precursor to a JBW (IMPS) simulation, the same force-field (MMFF or MMFFs) should be used in both.</p>
        <p>The MMFF94 (or MMFF for short) force field was introduced by Thomas A. Halgren (<i>J. Comput. Chem.</i><b>1996</b>, vol. 17, no. 5). MMFF is an all-atom force field, with no lone pairs. Thus, its MacroModel "H-addition profile" is the same as those of AMBER94 and MM3. MMFF has been carefully parametrized for a wide variety of organic functional groups and for proteins (see MMFF-I). It should thus be well suited for drug-receptor studies. MMFF charges (see MMFF-II) are derived in a manner suitable for use with the GB/SA solvation model.</p>
        <p>There are actually two MMFF force-fields implemented: MMFF and MMFFs, where the "s" is for "static." MMFF gives slightly pyramidal amide geometries and rather strongly pyramidal aniline, nucleic-acid base, and other enamine nitrogens. Experimental and theoretical studies indicate that this reflects the true ground- state geometry.</p>
        <p>In contrast, MMFFs uses modified torsion and out-of-plane bending parameters for these nitrogens, giving rise to planar or nearly planar geometries. Such nitrogens appear planar in crystal structures, due to time-averaging of the rapidly inverting pyramidal geometries.</p>
        <p>Regular MMFF likely is most useful for dynamics studies (where actual time averaging yields planar average structures), whereas the MMFFs is probably most useful for conformational search and for minimizations that are to be compared with crystallographic data. With the obvious exception of inversion barriers, the two force fields give similar (and, when delocalized trigonal nitrogens are not involved, identical) relative conformational energies.</p>
        <p>MMFF treats "protein metals" such as Zn<sup>+2</sup>, Cu<sup>+</sup>, Cu<sup>+2</sup>, Fe<sup>+2</sup>, and Fe<sup>+3</sup>, as well as an assortment of alkali and alkaline earth cations, via the commonly used "nonbonded" model, which employs van der Waals and electrostatic interactions between the ligand and metal atoms. Covalent systems involving metals can be accommodated by means of user-defined atom types and parameters.</p>
        <p>The MacroModel implementation of MMFF was developed in cooperation with Dr. Halgren. And unlike our other force fields, the assignment of parameters to interactions (stretch, bend, nonbonded, etc.) is handled by a server co-process, called "mmff_setup," which was written by Dr. Halgren. But, as with any other force-field, MMFF parameters can be printed to the <code>.mmo</code> file using the Maestro <span class="GUI">Current Energy</span> panel with complete listing (MacroModel "ELST 1") and displayed using the force field viewer (see <span class="GUI">Force Field Viewer</span> on the <span class="GUI">Tools</span> menu).</p>
        <p>Communication between the server process and Maestro is handled by an interface layer called the BMFF library. For details of how BMFF works and for a discussion of how to add new or overriding parameters to the MMFF force-field file (<code>f10.fld</code>), see <a href="../macromodel_command_reference/bmff_protocol.htm">The BMFF Protocol</a>.</p>
