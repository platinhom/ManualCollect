        <h1>AMBER94 Force Field</h1>
        <p>AMBER94 is the authentic AMBER 94 force field. It all-atom model that uses no lone pairs. This field works well for biopolymers (peptides, proteins and nucleic acids) but has few parameters for organic molecules. The option for extended nonbonded cutoff distances is recommended to obtain the highest accuracy with polar molecules. AMBER assigns constant dielectric electrostatics (e = 1) by default. Solvation energies of the AMBER field are reliable in both water and chloroform.</p>
        <p>This version of AMBER is based on the 1994 parameter set of Kollman et al. (Cornell, W. D.; Cieplak, P.; Bayly, C. I.; Gould, I. R.; Merz, K. M.; Ferguson, D. M.; Spellmeyer, D. C.; Fox, T.; Caldwell, J. W.; Kollman, P. A. <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc.</i><b>1995</b>, 117, 5179.) What follows are some notes regarding the MacroModel (the computational component of MacroModel) implementation of this force field.</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p>Unlike AMBER*, the new AMBER parameter set contains only parameters for carbons with all attached hydrogens explicitly represented.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>AMBER94 is designed for use in condensed phases. For this reason, it is recommended that the GB/SA solvation model be used in conjunction with the AMBER94 parameter set. The charge derivation method used in AMBER94 (RESP fitting to HF/6-31G* wave functions) gives charges that perform well in calculations of absolute solvation free energies of small molecules (see the section "Absolute Free Energies of Hydration from the GB/SA model - Dependence on Partial Charges" in the MacroModel Technical Manual). We therefore anticipate that the combination of the GB/SA model and the AMBER94 parameters will be a powerful methodology for simulations of biomolecules in solution.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>Unlike AMBER*, AMBER94's parameters have not been extended beyond those reported by Kollman et al. As a result AMBER94's utility with organic functionalities is limited, and it is recommended that it is used only with proteins and nucleic acids.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p>The MacroModel AMBER94 implementation uses the same van der Waals parameters for all both amide and amine nitrogens. Although the Kollman paper gives the two nitrogen types different VDW parameters, we have continued to use the same VDW parameter for both in order to maintain consistency with the AMBER4.1 program.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="5">
                <p>Lone pairs are not used on sulfur (or any other) atoms in AMBER94. Kollman et al. point out that neutral sulfur atoms are rarely seen as hydrogen bond acceptors.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="6">
                <p>AMBER94 as implemented in MacroModel should give results very close to those obtained with the AMBER 4.1 program suite. There are, however, some areas where the results obtained with the two programs may differ slightly. In MacroModel the partial atomic charges are derived from bond dipoles, not stored as absolute values as in AMBER4.1. The charges differ in the fifth decimal place and this electrostatic energies obtained with MacroModel will be slightly different to those obtained with AMBER4.1. This difference is of the order of 1 kJ/mol for a large, highly charged structure such as d(ATGC).d(TACG). Additionally, there may be some small differences between the improper torsion energies calculated with MacroModel and those calculated with AMBER4.1. These arise because, for some generalized improper torsions, the two programs can select different ways to measure the angle. All other energy terms are calculated identically between the two programs.</p>
