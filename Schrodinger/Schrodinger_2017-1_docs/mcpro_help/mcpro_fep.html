        <h1>MCPRO+ Free-Energy Perturbation Calculations</h1>
        <p>MCPRO+ can perform free-energy perturbation (FEP) calculations on ligands, proteins and complexes.</p>
        <h2>Setting Up Structures for Free-Energy Perturbation</h2>
        <p>The structures that you use for an FEP calculation must have the same atom ordering (by atom number) in the structures at either end of the perturbation, so that the proper associations between the structures can be made. If the atom numbering does not match, the results are likely to be erroneous.</p>
        <p>In order to run an FEP calculation to convert one structure into another structure with different numbers of atoms, dummy atoms must be added to the smaller structure that correspond to atoms in the larger structure. When preparing structures for FEP, it is therefore a good idea to use the larger structure to prepare the smaller structure, by converting atoms into dummy atoms. For example, if you wanted to convert a methyl group into a hydrogen, you would create the structure with the hydrogen from the structure with the methyl by converting the methyl hydrogens to dummy atoms first, then converting the methyl carbon to a hydrogen atom.</p>
        <p>You can make these changes with the tools in the <span class="GUI">Build</span> panel, as follows:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>Display the larger structure in the Workspace.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>Choose <span class="GUI">Edit → Build → Atom Properties</span>, to open the <span class="GUI">Build</span> panel at the <span class="GUI">Atom Properties</span> tab.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>Choose <span class="GUI">Atom Type (MacroModel)</span> from the <span class="GUI">Properties</span> option menu.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p>Select <span class="GUI">Special dummy atom type (FEP)</span> from the list (symbol Du, type 61).</p>
            </li>
            <li value="5">
                <p>Click on the atoms that you want to convert to dummy atoms.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="6">
                <p>Select the appropriate type for any other kind of atom that you want to change, and click on it.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Other structural alterations, in which atoms are added and subtracted, are more difficult. You can convert one structure into the other using the tools in the <span class="GUI">Build</span> panel, but you must be careful how you do the conversion. When you replace one fragment with another, Maestro first removes the old fragment, renumbers the atoms, then adds the new fragment. If the fragment you remove has the highest atom numbers in the structure, there is no problem, but if it does not, then you must convert atom types for the existing atoms, then add new atoms. Likewise, if you delete atoms, you must ensure that the atoms you delete have the highest atom numbers. Since Maestro does not provide user-controlled atom numbering, this approach is likely to fail to produce the desired numbering scheme. The best strategy is likely to be to start by removing atoms from one of the structures until you are left with only the common atoms, then rebuilding both structures from this fragment.</p>
