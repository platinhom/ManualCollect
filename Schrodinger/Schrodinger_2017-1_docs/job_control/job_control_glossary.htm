        <p><b>entry</b>—(1) A collection of settings in the hosts file that defines a configuration for running jobs on a given host. There can be more than one entry for a given host, with different settings. <br />(2) A structure and its properties in a Maestro project.</p>
        <p><b>execution host</b> —The computer that a job runs on.</p>
        <p><b>hosts file</b>—The file that contains information on available hosts that is used by Job Control. This file is usually named <code>schrodinger.hosts</code>. </p>
        <p><b>job directory</b>—The directory on the execution host to which the input files are copied from the submission host and from which the output files back to the submission host when the job is finished. This is usually a subdirectory of the scratch directory that is created by Job Control.</p>
        <p><b>launch directory</b>—The directory from which the job is started. Same as <i>submission directory</i>.</p>
        <p><b>launch host</b>—The computer that you submit a job from. Same as <i>submission host</i>.</p>
        <p><b>local host</b>—The computer that you are logged on to. Usually this is also the computer you are using for job submission. </p>
        <p><a name="Maestro_resources_directory"></a><b>Maestro user resources directory</b>—The <code>maestro<span class="VariablesMaestroNoDot">111</span></code> subdirectory (folder) of your <a href="#user_resources_directory" class="selected">Schrödinger user resources directory</a>.</p>
        <p><b>output directory</b>—The directory to which output files are copied at the end of the job. This is usually the same as the submission directory.</p>
        <p><b>queue host</b>—A computer that can run the queueing software. This is not necessarily the queue manager: for example, if the queuing software is installed on an NFS-mounted file system, it could be any host that has that file system mounted.</p>
        <p><b>remote host</b>—A computer that is available to you over a network. </p>
        <p><b>remote job submission</b>—Submitting a job to a computer other than the one you are logged on to or that you are running Maestro on. </p>
        <p><a name="user_resources_directory"></a><b>Schrödinger user resources directory</b>—location for storage of resources (files, scripts, data) used by Schrödinger software for an individual user, but shared across computers. This location is <code>$HOME/.schrodinger</code> on Linux and <code>%APPDATA%\Schrodinger</code> on Windows. (<code>%APPDATA%</code> corresponds to <code>C:\Users\<i>username</i>\AppData\Roaming</code>)</p>
        <p><b>scratch directory</b>—The directory that is used for temporary files. The files are usually created in a subdirectory of this directory that is unique to the user and the job. </p>
        <p><b>submission directory</b>—The directory from which the job is started. This is the directory from which input files (specified without a path) are copied to the job directory, and to which output files are copied at the end of the job. </p>
        <p><b>submission host</b>—The computer that you submit a job from.</p>
