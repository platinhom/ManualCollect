        <h1 class="Title">Preparing the Ligands for VSW</h1>
        <p>In the <span class="GUI">Preparation</span> tab you set options for ligand preparation with LigPrep. If you only want to prepare and filter a set of ligands, you can run the job when you have made settings in this tab, and ignore the remaining two tabs, which specify the receptors and the docking options.</p>
        <p class="image">

        <p class="figure" data-mc-autonum="Figure 1:"><span class="autonumber"><span>Figure 1:</span></span>The Preparation tab of the Virtual Screening Workflow panel.</p>
        <p>If your structures are already 3D all-atom structures with the appropriate ionization and tautomeric states, you do not need to prepare the ligands, and you can deselect the <span class="GUI">Prepare ligands</span> option. This is usually the case if you are docking from a Phase database. Otherwise, ensure that this option is selected, and choose the desired options for ligand preparation.</p>
        <p>You can choose to regularize the input geometries, so that ligands that are identical apart from small deviations in the atom positions are always treated the same. To do so, select <span class="GUI">Regularize input geometries</span>. This process is run prior to LigPrep, and uses a conversion to unique SMILES to ensure the same atom numbering and geometry. All atom properties are lost when you perform this conversion, but entry properties, including the title, are retained. </p>
        <p>As part of the regularization, you can remove duplicate structures, by selecting <span class="GUI">Remove duplicates</span>. When testing for duplicates, you can remove any other small molecules such as counter ions, by selecting <span class="GUI">Desalt</span>; you can neutralize the structures, by selecting <span class="GUI">Neutralize</span>; and you can merge the properties from the two structures, by selecting <span class="GUI">Merge properties</span>. If the properties have different values, the property is converted to a string that lists the values.</p>
        <p>To generate ionization (protonation) states that are likely to exist in a given pH range, enter the target pH and the range in the <span class="GUI">Generate states at pH</span> text boxes. You can generate these states with either the Ionizer or Epik, by selecting the appropriate option. Epik is licensed separately from LigPrep; the Ionizer is included with LigPrep. In addition to varying the ionization state, LigPrep generates tautomeric states that are likely in the given pH range. You can remove ionization and tautomeric states that have large penalties by selecting <span class="GUI">Remove high-energy ionization/tautomer states</span>. These are states that are likely to have low populations under the chosen conditions. If you select Epik for state generation, you can also generate extra states that are appropriate for binding to metals in metalloproteins, by selecting <span class="GUI">Add Epik metal binding state</span>s. These states are not normally generated at physiological pH. </p>
        <p>The LigPrep run varies the stereochemistry, if it is not predetermined. Any existing chirality information in the input file is preserved, and chemically reasonable chiralities are initially assigned for steroids, fused ring systems, and peptides. If you already have 3D structures, you can select <span class="GUI">3D Geometry</span> under <span class="GUI">Obtain stereochemical information from</span> to determine the stereochemistry from the structure. Otherwise select <span class="GUI">Specified 2D stereo properties </span>to make use of information in 2D structure files. For the unspecified stereocenters, up to 32 stereoisomers are generated. These are ranked by energy, and only the lowest-energy stereoisomers are returned. You can control how many are returned by entering the number to return in the <span class="GUI">Unspecified stereocenters: retain up to </span><i class="UserReplace">N</i><span class="GUI"> stereoisomers </span>text box.</p>
        <p>Ring conformations are varied by LigPrep. You can limit the number of ring conformations returned by entering the maximum number in the <span class="GUI">Generate low-energy ring conformations: </span><i class="UserReplace">N</i><span class="GUI"> per ligand</span> text box. This sampling does not include 7-membered and larger rings, which can be sampled with MacroModel after ligand preparation by selecting <span class="GUI">Enhance sampling of large rings using MacroModel</span>.</p>
