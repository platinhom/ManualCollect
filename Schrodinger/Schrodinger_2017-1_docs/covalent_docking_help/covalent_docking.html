        <p>Dock a set of ligands to a receptor, in which the ligands form a covalent bond to a receptor residue or site by a specified type of reaction (such as a Michael addition). The ligands must all contain the reactive group, which is specified by a SMARTS pattern.</p>
        <p class="opening">To open this panel, choose <span class="GUI">Tasks → Receptor-Based Virtual Screening → Docking → Covalent Docking</span> in the Task Tool.</p>
        <h2><a name="using"></a>Using the Covalent Docking Panel</h2>
        <p>Covalent docking has two main goals:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Locate the best docked pose for each ligand and rank the poses for each ligand by energy.</li>
            <li value="2">Rank ligands according to the ability of the ligand to bind noncovalently in a suitable pose for reaction to form a covalent bond.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The ligands must be a series of related compounds, all of which react with the receptor at the same site and by the same mechanism. Use of covalent docking to compare different mechanisms or different types of compound will not produce meaningful results.</p>
        <p>The covalent docking process has several stages:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>Dock the ligands into noncovalently bound poses that are suitable for covalent bond formation. To allow for different possible conformations of the side chains of the reactive residue, it is mutated to alanine in this stage. This removes any bias towards a particular ligand conformation that would occcur if the side chain were regarded as fixed. The ligands are docked with Glide, subject to constraints between the attachment atoms on the receptor and the ligand.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>Form the bond between the receptor and the ligand. First, the reactive residue side chain is restored, and its rotamers are sampled to find the best conformation for each ligand pose. The bond is then formed and poses are discarded if the ligand-receptor bond is too long. The ligand and reactive residue, now covalently bound, are then minimized and the poses clustered.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>Minimize and rank the poses. After clustering, a representative pose is selected from each cluster, and the poses are minimized with Prime. The poses for each ligand are then ranked by the Prime energy.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p>Score poses for the affinity of the ligand to the receptor for noncovalent binding prior to reaction. Ligands that do not score well are considered less likely to approach the receptor in a way that permits covalent bond formation. In this stage, the bond is broken again, the reactive receptor residue is mutated to alanine, and the bond to the ligand is capped with hydrogen. Scoring is then done with Glide, and the affinity is reported as the average of the pre-reacted and post-reacted GlideScore for a given pose.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>There is also a virtual screening mode, in which rotamer sampling and minimizations are not performed, and ligand sampling is reduced. The affinity score and the Prime MM-GBSA energy are not calculated, as the poses are not accurate enough, but the docking score can be used to filter the poses.</p>
        <p>To set up a covalent docking run, you must have a receptor that is prepared for modeling and a set of prepared ligands that all have the required functional group for reaction. It is recommended that you use the <a href="../protein_prep_help/protein_preparation.html">Protein Preparation Wizard</a> for preparing the protein, and <a href="../ligprep_help/ligprep.html">LigPrep</a> to prepare the ligands. You might also have to filter the ligands to ensure that they all have the required functional group, which you can do in the <a href="../maestro_tools_help/ligfilter.html"><span class="GUI">Ligand Filtering</span> panel</a>. With these structures available, the process for setting up a default job is described in the steps below.</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>Open the <span class="GUI">Covalent Docking</span> panel.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>Choose the source of ligands from the <span class="GUI">Use ligands from</span> option menu, and if using a file, specify the file.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>Display the receptor in the Workspace and choose the reactive residue: in the <span class="GUI">Receptor</span> tab, select <span class="GUI">Pick</span> and pick a residue in the Workspace.</p>
                <p>The reactive residue must be of the correct type for the desired reaction—see the <a href="#feature3.1">table</a> below for a list of allowed residues.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p>Define the center of the grid box for the Glide docking.</p>
                <p>If you want to define the center with a ligand, you must include the ligand in the Workspace.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="5">
                <p>Choose the reaction type: in the <span class="GUI">Reaction Type</span> tab, select a reaction from the <span class="GUI">Reaction type</span> option menu.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="6">
                <p>(Optional) Edit the SMARTS pattern for the ligand reactive group, and add SMARTS patterns, or import a set of SMARTS patterns defined previously.</p>
                <p>The default SMARTS pattern is generic and minimal, and might match groups on your ligands that you do not want to consider. Editing the default pattern and adding other patterns allows you more control over the matching. It may be useful to have a ligand displayed in the Workspace on which you can select atoms for the SMARTS pattern that define the functional group.</p>
                <p>To edit or add SMARTS patterns, click <span class="GUI">Edit</span> or <span class="GUI">New</span>, and modify the SMARTS pattern directly, or pick atoms in the Workspace to define the group and click <span class="GUI">Get From Selection</span>. Choose an atom in the SMARTS pattern from the <span class="GUI">Position</span> option menu as the reactive atom, and click <span class="GUI">OK</span>. When you have edited the default pattern, you can add more patterns. 
You can set preferences for inclusion of various notational elements in the
generated SMARTS pattern in the <span class="GUI">Preferences</span> panel, under 
<a href="../maestro_help/preferences.html#smarts"><span class="GUI">SMARTS
generation</span></a>.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="7">
                <p>In the <span class="GUI">Docking</span> tab, choose a docking mode: <span class="GUI">Pose prediction</span> for the most thorough treatment, or <span class="GUI">Virtual screening</span>, for a faster treatment that can be used on thousands of ligands.</p>
                <p>The virtual screening mode leaves out most of the minimization and conformational searching, and is at least 10 times faster. Pose prediction mode can take an hour or two per ligand.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="8">
                <p>Specify the number of output poses per ligand that you want returned.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="9">
                <p>Start the job.</p>
                <p>The process can take several hours per ligand. You should therefore consider distributing the job over multiple processors, which you can do by clicking the <span class="GUI"> Job Settings</span> button (gear icon) and choosing the host, the number of processors, and the number of subjobs. The number of subjobs should not be greater than the number of ligands.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>The results of a covalent docking run are the covalently bound poses in a Maestro file. Each pose has three main properties associated with it: the affinity score, the Prime energy of the pose, and an index that identifies the reactive site on the ligand if the ligand has more than one such site. Since comparing poses is only meaningful for poses bonded at the same site, you can use the index to select and compare poses for a particular site.</p>

        <h3><a name="reaction_type"></a>Reaction Type tab</h3>
        <p>The task in this tab is simple: choose a reaction type for the formation of the covalent bond between the ligand and the receptor. The reaction type defines the functional group on the ligand, the allowed residue types or groups in the receptor with which the ligand can react, and the operations that must be performed on the structures to create the covalent bond. The reaction types, the ligand functional groups in terms of a SMARTS pattern, and the allowed residue types are given in the table below. The notation R-SH,OH means one of six residues with an SH or OH bond: CYS, SER, THR, ASP, GLU, TYR. The reactive site is not limited to standard residues, however: you can select any group that fits the reaction type. For example, any R-OH group can be used as a reactive site instead of a standard residue that has an OH group.</p>
        <p>If you want to investigate some other reaction type, you must have a custom chemistry file, which defines all the required quantities. You can make your own custom chemistry file using the procedure described in the <i>Covalent Docking</i> manual. This feature allows you to specify a reactive site on the receptor other than a standard residue, for example.</p>
        <p>The ligands are automatically analyzed for matches to the SMARTS patterns when any change is made to the reaction type or the SMARTS patterns. This process is fast, but a warning is posted if you have more than 1000 ligands. A progress bar is displayed for the analysis.</p>
