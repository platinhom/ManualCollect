            <dd>
                <p>Specify the resolution of the surface, which is created using interpolation on a cubic grid. Higher resolution means a smoother surface, which is slower to generate and draw. Lower resolution means a rougher surface but faster to generate and draw (and hence rotating will be faster). When you choose <span class="GUI">Low</span>, <span class="GUI">Medium</span>, or <span class="GUI">High</span>, the grid spacing in angstroms is displayed in the text box to the right. The default choice is <span class="GUI">Automatic</span>, which selects high resolution for less than 1000 atoms, medium for less than 10000 atoms, and low for more atoms. If you want to specify the grid spacing, choose <span class="GUI">Custom</span> and enter the desired value in the text box.</p>

            <dd>
                <p>This text box specifies the radius of the probe that is to be rolled over the van der Waals surface for a molecular surface, or added to the van der Waals radius for an extended radius surface. The default  probe radius of 1.4&#160;Å corresponds to a water molecule as the probe.</p>

                <p> If the atom selection for which the surface is created contains parts of molecules, these options allow you to choose whether to leave the surface open (Leave open surface edges) or close it (Close the surface). If you choose to close the surface, the surface will cross bonds in the molecule, and part of the molecule will be outside the surface. If you choose to leave it open, the edges may be a bit rough.</p>

                <p>Generate the surface or surfaces. Surfaces are created for each molecule represented in the atom selection. Large-sized surfaces or surfaces with fine grid spacing can take some time to generate, and Maestro is not available until the task finishes.</p>

        <h2><a name="background"></a>Molecular Surface Technical Details</h2>
        <p>Imagine rolling a ball over the assembly of spheres constituting the van der Waals surface. Where the outside of the ball contacts the van der Waals spheres, the surfaces coincide. But where two vdW spheres come together, the Connolly surface follows the surface of the solvent sphere, giving fillets rather than cusps where the van der Waals spheres intersect. True Connolly surfaces are very expensive to generate, in general; therefore often an approximation is used.</p>
        <p>In the ball-rolling description of an extended surface, the locus of points described by the surface of the probe sphere closest to the molecular system constitutes the molecular surface. The molecular surface follows the van der Waals surface except where the surfaces of two atomic spheres are closer together than a probe diameter. In such regions (termed "re-entrant"), the molecular surface is bridged over by a surface section that follows the probe surface. The concept of molecular surface is usually associated with Connolly (Connolly, M.L. Analytical molecular surface calculation, <i>J. Appl. Crystallogr.</i><b>1983</b>, <i>16</i>, 548-558). However, Maestro does not use Connolly's algorithm for producing the molecular surface.</p>
        <p>The method used by Maestro to create the molecular surface is an elaboration of what is sometimes called the "ink-blot" method. In the ink-blot method, the volume enclosed by the extended surface is first constructed. Then any points within this volume that lie interior to the generating solvent probe are declared to be external. After this process is complete, the boundary of the remaining internal volume is the molecular surface.</p>
        <p>Maestro first sets up the grid for the extended surface and interpolates within it to produce the extended surface, as in the extended-surface algorithm described above. Recall that interior grid points have values less then unity and exterior points have values greater than unity. These values are reset so that exterior points are given a value of zero and interior points are given a value much greater than unity. Then a probe sphere is placed on each vertex of the extended surface in turn. For each placement, for all grid vertices in the probe sphere's minimal enclosing grid cube, the grid vertices are given the value Min(d/r, previous_value). Outside the extended surface, the value will always remain zero. Inside the extended surface, the value will rise from near zero close to the probe center to somewhat greater than unity at the grid cube boundaries. The vertices of the molecular surface are then created by interpolation to unity on the grid.</p>
        <p>The molecular surface appears from the outside to closely resemble the van der Waals surface, since it follows the van der Waals surface, except for the bridging re-entrant portions. We mentioned earlier that interior atoms of an extended surface are buried (have no surface points on their atomic spheres), but that few, if any, atoms are buried in this sense for a van der Waals surface. Atoms that are buried in an extended surface will also be buried in a molecular surface, since no atomic sphere will have molecular surface points on it unless the atom is adjacent to a region in which a probe molecule will fit. Thus, in their tendency to bury atoms, molecular surfaces resemble extended surfaces rather than van der Waals surfaces.</p>
