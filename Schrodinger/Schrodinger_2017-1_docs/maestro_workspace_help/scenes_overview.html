        <h1>Scenes</h1>
        <p>Scenes are a means of storing multiple independent "snapshots" of a project or a part of a project. They are stored inside the project, and can be used as sub-projects, or exported to create presentations.</p>
        <p>Scenes include the entries that you choose for the scene, along with any associated data such as surfaces, hypotheses, and so on; the project table state; and commands that set up the Workspace as it was when the scene was created, such as display options, measurements, and so on.</p>
        <p>Scenes do not include panel layout or state (including Workspace layout). When a scene is created, it does not contain plots, data from CombiGlide, Prime, or Phase runs, and job data, because these could contain information on entries that are not in the scene. They can be added after the scene is created.</p>
        <p>You can work in a scene that you are viewing just like you can in the project itself: add or delete entries, run jobs, create plots, and so on. However, to keep the changes you must either overwrite the old scene, or create a new scene. If you exit the scene without saving it, the changes are discarded.</p>
        <p>When you open a scene, a special toolbar is displayed below the Workspace area, which contains a button to close the scene, navigation tools to step through the scenes, and a text box that indicates which scene is being shown, with the first line of the description. Because scenes are projects, stepping to the next scene involves closing a project and opening a new project. The speed of this operation depends on how big the scene is.</p>
        <p>To create a scene, choose <span class="GUI">Workspace → Project Scenes → New</span>.
</p>
        <p>To view a scene, choose <span class="GUI">Workspace → Project Scenes → View</span></p>
        <p>To manage scenes (add, delete, rearrange, export), choose: <span class="GUI">Workspace → Project Scenes → Manage</span> to open the <a href="manage_scenes.html" class="MCXref xref" xrefformat="{paratext}">Manage Scenes Panel</a>.</p>
