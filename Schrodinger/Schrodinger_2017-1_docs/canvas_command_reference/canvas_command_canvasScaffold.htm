            canvasScaffold</h1>
        <p>This utility decomposes structures into a set of scaffolds (detection), and searches a set of structures to determine which structures contain each scaffold in a set of scaffolds (matching). </p>
        <p>Scaffold detection consists of identifying all unique scaffolds within a set of structures. The largest scaffold in a structure is obtained by stripping off all terminal side-chains with the exception of exocyclic and exolinker double bonds such as &gt;C=O. For example, quinone contains two exocyclic double bonds and benzophenone contains a single exolinker double bond. These C=O bonds would be retained as part of the quinone ring system and part of the benzophenone linker, respectively. </p>
        <p>A given scaffold is broken into smaller subscaffolds by removing linkers between ring systems, but not by splitting fused ring systems. So, for example, benzophenone would be split into two benzene rings, but naphthalene would not.</p>
        <p> Generation of subscaffolds is exhaustive, so if R1, R2, and R3 are ring systems, the scaffold R1–R2–R3 would produce the subscaffolds R1–R2, R2–R3, R1, R2, and R3. Scaffold detection finds all such scaffolds, and stores them in a list that is sorted by decreasing scaffold size. The size of a scaffold is based on the number of ring systems, followed by the number of linkers, followed by the number of heavy atoms, followed by molecular weight, followed by canonical SMILES. Sorting in this manner guarantees that the subscaffolds of a given scaffold will always appear after the scaffold itself. </p>
        <p>Scaffold matching consists of taking a set of structures and a set of scaffolds, and determining which scaffolds are contained in each structure. The scaffolds may or may not come from the structures being matched against them. Since matching produces a list of scaffolds for each structure, it is possible to assign the structures into clusters based on the scaffolds they contain. </p>
        <p>Results of scaffold detection are written to j<i class="UserReplace">obname</i><code>_detect.csv</code>, which contains a canonical SMILES string for each scaffold, a unique scaffold ID, and quoted, space-delimited lists of the source input structure numbers, superscaffold IDs, and subscaffold IDs. For example,</p><pre>
SMILES,ID,Source,Super,Sub
n1ccccc1Cc2ccccc2,1,"1","","3 4"
c1ccccc1Cc2ccccc2,2,"2","","4"
c1ccncc1,3,"1","1",""
c1ccccc1,4,"1 2","1 2",""
</pre>
        <p>A separate file, <i class="UserReplace">jobname</i><code>_scaffolds.dat</code>, is created with all the information required to reconstruct the original scaffolds and the relationships among them.</p>
        <p>Results of scaffold matching are written to <i class="UserReplace">jobname</i><code>_match.csv</code>. Each structure that matches at least one scaffold is written to <i class="UserReplace">jobname</i><code>_match.csv</code>, with canonical SMILES, structure name, an index that corresponds to the position of the structure in the original input file, and the IDs of the scaffolds matched by the structure. For example,</p><pre>
SMILES,Name,Index,IDs
O=C(O)c1ccc(cc1)Cc2ccccn2,"CHEM0192587",1,"1 3 4"
O=C(O)c1ccc(cc1)Cc2ccccc2,"CHEM0204591",2,"2 4"
</pre>
        <p>Here, CHEM0192587 matches scaffolds 1, 3 and 4, while CHEM0204591 matches scaffolds 2 and 4.</p>
        <p>The use of <code>-embed</code> needs some explanation. If a mixture of imidazoles and benzimidazoles is being analyzed and <code>-embed</code> is used with <code>-detect</code> or <code>-full</code>, embedded benzimidazole-imidazole relationships would be reported in <i class="UserReplace">jobname</i><code>_detect.csv</code>. When an embedded relationship is reported, the letter <code>e</code> is appended to the applicable source structure numbers and scaffold IDs. For example,</p><pre><code>S</code>MILES,ID,Source,Super,Sub 
c1cccc(c12)nc[nH]2,1,"1","","2e" 
c1[nH]cnc1,2,"1e","1e","" 
</pre>
        <p>Here, the Source value <code>1e</code> on line 3 indicates that scaffold 2 is an embedded scaffold of input structure 1. The Sub value <code>2e</code> on line 2 indicates that scaffold 2 is an embedded subscaffold of scaffold 1, and the Super value <code>1e</code> on line 3 indicates the reciprocal relationship.</p>
        <p>If <code>-embed</code> is used with <code>-match</code> or <code>-full</code>, imidazole would be listed in <i class="UserReplace">jobname</i><code>_match.csv</code> as an embedded match to any benzimidazole-containing structure. For example,</p><pre>
SMILES,Name,Index,IDs
c1cccc(c12)nc([nH]2)C,"2-methyl-benzimidazole",1,"1 2e"
</pre>
        <p>Here, <code>"1 2e"</code> indicates an ordinary match to benzimidazole (scaffold ID = 1), and an embedded match to imidazole (scaffold ID = 2).</p>
        <p>By default, no relationship is reported between imidazole and benzimidazole. Note also that if scaffold detection is performed on structures that contain only benzimidazole ring systems, imidazole would not be found as a scaffold, even with <code>-embed</code>.</p>
        <p>Scaffold detection scales linearly with the number of structures analyzed, and quadratically with the number of unique scaffolds contained in those structures. The quadratic part comes from the identification of superscaffold-subscaffold relationships. The worst case scenario is when there are a large number of unrelated structures, because many of the structures will have a unique backbone, and you will get a new scaffold for each of those backbones. </p>
