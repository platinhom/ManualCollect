        <h1 class="Title">MacroModel Solvation Treatment</h1>
        <p>While many molecular modeling studies are carried out without including the effect of solvent, the omission is largely one of expedience. Most experimental studies are carried out in solvent, and the solvent medium can have a major effect on molecular structures and energies. For some molecular types such as a small organic molecule with only one polar functional group, solvation does not appear to be a major determinant of conformational energies. However, for molecules having several polar functional groups, the effect of solvent can be dramatic since the electrostatically least stable structures are often the most heavily solvated (stabilized) in a polar solvent.</p>
        <p>Using an explicit solvent model is one approach; however, it has its own disadvantages. In particular, “explicit solvation” calculations run much more slowly because there are so many particles when hundreds of explicit solvent molecules are included. Furthermore, convergence is a problem in that longer simulations or different solvent starting configurations often give different final energies. Consequently, simple energy minimization is not useful in an explicit solvent.</p>
        <p>MacroModel uses an alternative solution model which treats the solvent as a fully equilibrated analytical continuum starting near the van der Waals surface of the solute. The model is termed the GB/SA model and is described in the literature <a class="Reference_Number MCXref xref xrefReference_Number" href="../macromodel_command_reference/mmod_references.htm#mmod_references_3670527510_741322" xrefformat="[{color #0E6895}{paranumonly}{/color}]">[<span style="color: #0e6895;" class="mcFormatColor">21</span>]</a>. MacroModel is provided with parameter files for water (<code>water.slv</code>), octanol (<code>octanol.slv</code>), and chloroform (<code>chcl3.slv</code>). Using the GB/SA model slows calculations by a factor of approximately three relative to the gas phase. However, because of the increased accuracy of modeling in solvent, it is suggested that the GB/SA continuum solvation model be used in all calculations for molecules for aqueous solutions. Solvation is controlled by the <span class="GUI">Solvent</span> option menu, located in the <span class="GUI">Potential</span> tab of the MacroModel panels within Maestro, or by the <span class="CodeLink"><a href="../macromodel_command_reference/opcodes_ffld.htm#opcodes_509685220_solv">SOLV</a></span> command in MacroModel command files.</p>
        <p>The calculation of Born radii in the GB part of the GB/SA model is performed by doing a volume integral. Stretch, bend, and non-bonded pairs (including 1-4 interactions) contribute to this integral. For large systems, such as proteins in which non-bonded cutoffs typically are used and not all non-bonded pairs are included on the non-bonded pair list in order to expedite calculation, Born radii are subject to systematic error. This is because the volume integration is performed by using pairs on the stretch, bend, and non-bonded pair lists, and the latter excludes longer range interactions when non-bonded cutoffs are in use. To correct for this error, MacroModel calculates the contribution from such longer range non-bonded pairs every time a non-bonded pair list update is done. This contribution is taken to be a fixed value and is used in energetic and derivative calculations. Although not an exact correction, inclusion of this contribution in this manner does help significantly. The correction is enabled by default; see the description for debug flags 830 and 832 under the <span class="CodeLink"><a href="../macromodel_command_reference/opcodes_misc_debug.htm#opcodes_509685220_debg">DEBG</a></span> opcode description in <a class="TopicLink MCXref xref xrefTopicLink" href="../macromodel_command_reference/opcodes_misc_debug.htm#opcodes_509685220_44417" xrefformat="{paratext}">Miscellaneous and Debugging Opcodes</a> for information on disabling the correction.</p>
        <p>In calculations using continuum solvation, MacroModel uses an approximate solvent accessible surface area function for derivatives and then computes final energies with a more exact area function at the end of the calculation. Consequently, the intermediate energies which are listed during energy minimization iterations will differ from the final energies.</p>
        <p>See the <i>MacroModel Technical Manual</i> for a discussion on the performance of the GB/SA model with different sources of partial atomic charge.</p>
