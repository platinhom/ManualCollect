        <h1 class="Title">Renumbering Atoms for Reaction Path Interpolation</h1>
        <p>You can renumber the atoms if the reactant and product numbering schemes do not match, in the <span class="GUI">Reorder Atoms</span> dialog box, which you open by clicking <span class="GUI">Reorder Product Atoms</span>. This dialog box shows 2D images of the reactant and product complexes, and allows you to visually select the corresponding atoms for renumbering. The reactants constitute the reference structure and the products constitute the comparison structure (the one that is reordered). Atoms are indicated by their atom numbers, and are colored by element.</p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="reorder_atoms.png" style="margin: 2px;" />
        </p>
        <p>There are several ways in which you can use this dialog box to map the atoms of the comparison structure to those of the reference structure.</p>
        <p class="CapLettered1">Use the automated detection (guess) tools. Select a guess method and click <span class="GUI">Guess</span>. The guessed atoms are marked in light blue. If the guess is good, click <span class="GUI">Accept Guess</span>; if not, click <span class="GUI">Reject Guess</span>. The atoms are marked in green if the guess is accepted; if it is rejected the markers are removed. The guess methods do the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p class="ListPara"><span class="GUI">Monatomic elements</span>—Map atoms for elements that only occur once in the reference structure and in the comparison structure. </p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p class="ListPara"><span class="GUI">Unique SMILES order - conformers only</span>—Map atoms on the basis of the order in the unique SMILES string for the entire reference structure or comparison structure. The reference structure and the comparison structure must be conformers (no changes in bonding). This method might not be able to determine the mapping of hydrogen atoms. </p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p class="ListPara"><span class="GUI">SMARTS patterns of whole molecule or unique atoms</span>—Map atoms on the basis of SMARTS patterns, either of individual atoms or of whole molecules. If a SMARTS pattern has only one match in the reference structure and one match in the comparison structure, use that pattern to map the atom numbers. The SMARTS patterns for unique atoms identify individual atoms solely on the basis of their bonding pattern, with no account taken of the identity of the atoms to which they are bonded. </p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p class="ListPara"><span class="GUI">Based on superimposed 3D structures</span>—Superimpose the comparison structure on the reference structure, and map each comparison atom to the closest reference atom of the same element. If there is no nearby atom of the same element, the mapping of the atom is not done. This method uses the already-mapped atoms for the superposition, so there must be at least three atoms mapped before this method can be used. </p>
            </li>
            <li value="5">
                <p class="ListPara"><span class="GUI">Use all methods</span>—Use all of the applicable methods to determine the mapping between the reference and comparison atoms. </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="CapLettered1_">Pick corresponding atoms in the two diagrams. First, pick a reference atom, which is then marked with a yellow square. Then pick the corresponding comparison atom. The atoms are marked with green markers.</p>
        <p class="Indented1">If you pause the pointer over a mapped atom, it is marked with a green square, and the mapped atom in the comparison structure is also marked with a green square. This also happens if you select a mapped atom, which allows you to identify which atom it is currently mapped to.</p>
        <p class="CapLettered1_">Pick corresponding atoms in the two atom lists, reference first. The atoms are identified by element and atom number. The atoms are marked in the diagrams when you pick rows in the lists. The reference rows are terminated with a dash prior to mapping; the mapped comparison atom number is added after the dash when a reference atom is mapped. Rows for unmapped atoms are colored white; rows for mapped atoms are colored green; rows for guessed mappings are colored light blue.</p>
        <p>You can also combine any method with automatic mapping of hydrogens and monatomic elements, by selecting <span class="GUI">Automatically map hydrogens and monatomic elements</span>. Whenever a change is made to the mapping, any hydrogens attached to mapped atoms are mapped if possible, and any remaining atoms that are the only remaining unmapped instances of an element are also mapped. The mapping of hydrogens is done as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p class="ListPara">If the reference atom and the corresponding comparison atom have only one hydrogen, that hydrogen is mapped.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p class="ListPara">If the reference atom and the corresponding comparison atom have the same number of hydrogens (more than one), and the dihedral angles for the hydrogens in the reference structure can be matched to dihedral angles for the hydrogens in the comparison structure, the hydrogens are mapped.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you make a mistake in the mapping, you can simply select the mis-mapped atom in the reference diagram or list, and then select the correct atom in the comparison diagram or list.</p>
        <p>If you want to clear the entire mapping and start over, click <span class="GUI">Clear Mapping</span>.</p>
