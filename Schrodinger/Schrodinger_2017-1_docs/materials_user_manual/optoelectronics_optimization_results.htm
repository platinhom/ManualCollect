        <h1 class="Title">Monitoring and Examining the Property Optimization Results</h1>
        <p>As the jobs can take a long time, it may be useful to examine the results as it is running, for example to assess the progress or success of the optimization, or to make use of structures that meet some criteria before the job finishes. You can do this in the <span class="GUI">Optoelectronics Genetic Optimization Viewer</span> panel, which you open by choosing <span class="GUI">Tasks → Quantum Mechanics → Optoelectronics → Genetic Optimization Monitoring</span> in the Task Tool.</p>
        <p>When you click <span class="GUI">Load New Job</span> a panel opens so you can select the job. You can either select <span class="GUI">Load from job database</span>, then select a job from the table of jobs, or you can select <span class="GUI">Manually locate GA directory</span> and click <span class="GUI">Browse</span> to open a directory selector and navigate to a directory that contains the job results. This allows you to examine a job for which the job record no longer exists in the job database.</p>
        <p>Clicking <span class="GUI">Refresh Current Job</span> updates the results for the job that is loaded. This action is only effective if the job is still running.</p>
        <p>To view 2D structures together with scores and property values, arranged in a grid in a separate window, select <span class="GUI">Show structure window</span>. You can set the number of columns in the grid, and display the structures from each generation in a separate row. You can select multiple structures, and either incorporate them into the project or remove them from the structure window. Structures are not incorporated again if they have already been incorporated.</p>
        <p>The <span class="GUI">Summary</span> tab provides a summary of the job, including the properties chosen for optimization and the criteria for optimizing the properties, the parameters set for the genetic algorithm, and the log file for the job.</p>
        <p>The panel has three tabs, which offer different ways of assessing the progress of the optimization.</p>
        <h3 class="Heading3Nonum">Min/Max Plot</h3>
        <p>In the <span class="GUI">Min/Max Plot</span> tab, you can display the minimum value and the maximum value of any property as a function of the generation. For the scores, if the maximum is not increasing, then the optimization is not making progress. If the maximum is not increasing much and the spread between the maximum and the minimum is increasing, the process is generating structures whose properties are less desirable. You then might want to adjust the parameters to increase the generation of improved structures, or you might want to consider what kinds of mutations you are performing.</p>
        <p>You can choose the property to display in the plot area and select the statistics to plot. If you select both the minimum and the maximum, the area between the lines is colored light green, to highlight the range of values observed. Pausing the pointer over a point displays the 2D structure and property values for that structure; the points (circles) are only plotted for the minimum and maximum. Clicking (or right-clicking) on a point displays a menu that allows you to add the structure to the Structure Window, incorporate the structure into the project, or incorporate all structures into the project.</p>

        </p>
        <h3 class="Heading3Nonum">Histogram</h3>
        <p>In the <span class="GUI">Histogram</span> tab, you can view how many structures had a particular range of values, color coded by generation. From this view you can assess whether the number of structures in the desirable ranges is increasing with each generation. You can choose the property to display, and set the number of bins for the property values. </p>
        <p>Each bar in the histogram is partitioned into regions by generation and color-coded according to the legend on the left. Pausing the pointer over a region shows information on the properties for the generation represented in that region of the bar. If there are fewer than 4 structures represented, information on all properties for each structure is shown, including the 2D structure. If there are 4 or more structures represented, the ranges of all properties are shown.</p>
        <p>If you click on a region, a menu is shown, which allows you to show the structures from that generation and bin (the region) or the structures from the entire bin (the bar); and to incorporate structures into the project from the generation and bin, the entire bin, or the entire set of structures.</p>

        </p>
        <h3 class="Heading3Nonum">Evolution</h3>
        <p>In the <span class="GUI">Evolution</span> tab, you can view the family tree of any particular individual in any generation. The tree is marked with green lines to the parents and blue lines to the children, and the individuals are colored by a property value. This allows you to see how the property value is changing between generations. The properties of the family (parents, individual, children) are shown in the <span class="GUI">Structure Window</span> so you can examine all the properties, not just the one used for coloring. You can choose the property to display and the color map for coding the property values. </p>
        <p>Each generation is shown as a horizontal bar, partitioned into rectangles for each individual. The rectangles are color coded by the property value. The tooltip for a rectangle shows the 2D structure and all of the properties.</p>
        <p>Clicking a rectangle displays a green line connecting the individual to the parent (for mutation) or parents (for crossover), and a blue line connecting the individual to its children. It also adds all of these structures to the Structure Window. Shift-clicking on any of the parent or children rectangles extends the family tree to the previous or next generation from that individual.</p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="optoelectronics_go_viewer_evolution.png" style="margin: 2px;" />
        </p>
        <p>Right-clicking in a rectangle displays a menu, which you can use to show the structure in the Structure Window, incorporate the structure, the generation, or all structures into the project, or clear the family tree display.</p>
