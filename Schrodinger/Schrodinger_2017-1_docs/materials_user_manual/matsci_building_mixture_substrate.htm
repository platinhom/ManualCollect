        <h1 class="Title">Building a Disordered Mixture on a Substrate</h1>
        <p>To build a disordered system on a substrate, you must load the substrate and identify the type of substrate it is. You can load the substrate from a file or from the Workspace, using the <span class="GUI">Structure</span> option menu and associated button. The file must be a Maestro file. </p>
        <p>The type of substrate that you loaded must be chosen from the <span class="GUI">Substrate type</span> option menu, as this affects the actions taken when building the disordered system on the substrate. There are three types of substrate:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p class="ListPara"><span class="GUI">Immersed</span>—The substrate is surrounded by the disordered system. This type of substrate can be used for nanoparticles or quantum dots immersed in a molecular mixture, or for a molecule of interest in a mixed solvent. The disordered system is placed in a box whose dimensions are set to accommodate the given number of molecules at the specified density, enlarged if necessary to ensure that there is enough space between the substrate and the box walls to fit any of the molecules of the mixture.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p class="ListPara"><span class="GUI">Container</span>—The molecules are placed inside cavities in the substrate. This type of substrate can be used for nanotubes, zeolites, and metal-organic frameworks, for example. The size of the cavities is fixed by the substrate structure itself, so can only accommodate a set number of molecules of a given size.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p class="ListPara"><span class="GUI">Planar interface</span>—The substrate surface is planar, or approximately so, and the disordered system is placed above this surface. This type of interface applies to a particular face of a crystal structure, or the surface of an amorphous solid, which could be somewhat irregular, or a graphene sheet, for example. The box in which the disordered system is placed has the entire surface of the substrate as one face, and the height of the box above the surface is adjusted to contain the disordered system. If the substrate already has crystal parameters defined, you can choose to extend the existing cell along one of the crystal vectors (which might be at an angle to the surface), by choosing <span class="GUI">Expand substrate periodic boundary condition</span>. Otherwise, a new orthorhombic box is created, with the surface as its base. If the surface is not rectangular, the base of the box is chosen to include the entire surface.</p>
                <p class="ListPara">To specify the surface to be used and any buffer distances between the substrate and the mixture, click <span class="GUI">Define Interface</span>. The <span class="GUI">Define Interface</span> dialog box opens, and the substrate is displayed in the Workspace with the default interface (surface plane) shown, and the direction of growth of the disordered system is indicated with an arrow. There are three options for the plane:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li value="1">
                        <p class="ListPara"><span class="GUI">Best fit to all atoms</span>—Define the interface plane as the best fit to all atoms in the structure. As the fitting on its own places the plane in the middle of the substrate, the plane is moved after fitting so that it rests on the surface of the structure. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li value="2">
                        <p class="ListPara"><span class="GUI">Crystal vector</span>—Define the interface as the plane that is perpendicular to one of the crystal vectors and at the surface of the substrate, and select the vector (<span class="GUI">a</span>, <span class="GUI">b</span>, or <span class="GUI">c</span>). The cell is extended in this direction to accommodate the disordered system. </p>
                        <p class="ListPara">If you want to choose a different crystal plane, you must prepare the substrate structure so that the desired plane is exposed, and then a new set of periodic boundary conditions is defined as part of building the disordered system.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li value="3">
                        <p class="ListPara"><span class="GUI">Choose at least 3 atoms to define the plane</span>—Define the interface plane as the best fit to the chosen atoms. Select <span class="GUI">Pick</span> and pick the atoms in the Workspace. The plane is fit to the atoms as you pick, after the third atom is picked, and the plane and arrow marker in the Workspace are centered at the centroid of the picked atoms. No adjustment is made to place the plane at the surface of the substrate. </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="ListPara">If the location of the plane and the direction of growth of the disordered system is on the wrong face of the substrate, click the <span class="GUI">Flip Direction</span> button. The arrow is reversed and the plane is moved to the other side of the substrate, except for the manual choice of the plane, where the direction is simply reversed. </p>
                <p class="ListPara">In addition to defining the plane, you can add a gap between the substrate and the disordered system, if you do not want the system in contact with the surface; and you can add a gap between the top of the disordered system and the boundary of the cell, where the image of the other side of the substrate is situated in a periodic system. A large gap can be used to simulate an isolated surface. A zero gap on both sides of the disordered system produces a layered system.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
