        <h1 class="Title">Creating a Fragment Collection for Building a Structure Library</h1>
        <p>To create a new fragment collection by selecting from a set of structures, you can use the <span class="GUI">Create Fragment Collection</span> panel. In this panel, you can import or draw structures, select the desired structures, define their attachment bonds, and add them to the fragment collection.</p>
        <p>To open the <span class="GUI">Create Fragment Collection</span> panel, click <span class="GUI">Create</span>. The panel opens with the <span class="GUI">Palette</span> tab displayed.</p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="create_fragment_collection_palette.png" style="margin: 2px;" />
        </p>
        <p>The palette—the display area for the structures—is initially empty. The palette is a table of structures that can be selected for addition of an attachment bond, after which it can be added to the fragment collection. You can set the number of columns in the <span class="GUI">Columns</span> box, and resize the table cells by dragging the row or column boundary in the table margin. You can clear the palette by clicking <span class="GUI">Clear</span>. </p>
        <p>To import structures into the palette, click <span class="GUI">Import Structures</span>. A menu is displayed that allows you to choose whether to import from a file, the selected entries in the Project Table, or the Workspace. If you choose <span class="GUI">Import from File</span>, a file selector opens, and you can navigate to and select the file. The file can be a Maestro file, without attachment bonds defined, or a reagent file with attachment bonds defined (<code>.bld</code>). The file selector opens in a directory that contains a default set of structures that are useful in a palette. When you click <span class="GUI">Open</span>, the file name is displayed in the <span class="GUI">Filename</span> text box, and the structures are shown in 2D form in the palette. </p>
        <p>If you already have structures, you can append to the list by selecting <span class="GUI">Append</span> and importing structures. If you want to replace the existing structures with a new set, select <span class="GUI">Replace</span> before importing the structures. </p>
        <p>To draw structures, click the <span class="GUI">Sketch Structures</span> tab. In this tab you can draw structures with the 2D Sketcher, then add them to the palette. You can place multiple structures on the drawing area, and when you click <span class="GUI">Add Structures</span>, all of them are added as independent fragments, after checking for duplicates. For information on the 2D Sketcher, see <a href="../maestro_tools_help/2d_sketcher.html" class="MCXref xref">2D Workspace Panel</a>.</p>
        <p>You can select multiple structures in the palette (with shift-click and control-click). The shortcut menu offers the choice of keeping only the selected structures or deleting them, or keeping only the structure clicked on or deleting it. This allows you to define new palette collections for later use. </p>
        <p>If you want to save a particular set of structures, click <span class="GUI">Export Structures</span>. The menu that is displayed offers the choice of exporting to a Maestro file or to the Project Table. Attachment bond information is not written with the structures. If you choose to export to a file, a file selector opens, in which you can navigate to a location and name the file. The export option is useful for creating a new file for future use in a palette after importing and possibly deleting structures from several files. </p>
        <p>After you have added structures to the palette, you can proceed to select a structure, add an attachment bond, and then add the structure to the current fragment collection. </p>
        <p>When you click on a structure in the palette, the structure is displayed in the <span class="GUI">Select attachment bond</span> section, so that you can define the attachment bond. The stereochemistry is indicated by wedge and dashed bonds. The title of the structure is displayed in the <span class="GUI">Title</span> text box, and the structure itself in the display area. To select the attachment bond, click on a bond in the display area. Clicking a second time on the same bond changes the direction of the attachment bond, if the bond is not terminal. The arrow on the bond points towards the part that is removed to attach the fragment to the core. </p>
        <p>To add this fragment to the collection, click <span class="GUI">Add</span>. The fragment flashes, and it is added to the current <span class="GUI">Fragment Collection</span> display of the <span class="GUI">Interactive Enumeration and Docking</span> panel. It is therefore a good idea to have both panels visible and next to each other, so that you can see the fragment being added to the fragment collection. </p>
        <p>If you want to add the same fragment with a different attachment point, you can select a different attachment bond and click <span class="GUI">Add</span>. The fragment is added to the collection again with the new attachment bond. </p>
