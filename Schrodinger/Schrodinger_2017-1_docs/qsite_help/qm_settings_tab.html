        <p>Use this tab to enter information for the quantum mechanics (QM) calculation, and to define the region to be treated quantum-mechanically.</p>
        <p>The QM information includes the QM method to be used, the charge and spin multiplicity of the QM system, and other keywords and options that may be required by Jaguar. For more information on Jaguar options, see the <a href="../jaguar_user_manual/jaguar_user_manualTOC.htm" target="pdfmanuals"><i>Jaguar User Manual</i></a>.</p>
        <p>The QM region is defined using any of the following methods:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Selecting the ligand, metal ions, or other disconnected species that are not covalently bonded to the protein.</li>
            <li value="2">Specifying <i>cuts</i> between certain covalently-bonded atoms in connected peptide residues.</li>
            <li value="3">Specifying <i>hydrogen caps</i> on atoms that are in the QM region that are singly-bonded to atoms in the MM region.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>QSite cuts are specially parametrized frozen-orbital boundaries between the QM and MM regions. They can be placed between an alpha carbon and a side chain (side-chain cuts) or between an alpha carbon and the backbone to one side (backbone cuts, which must be made in pairs to add the residues between them to the QM region).</p>
        <p>Cuts in a protein-ligand complex must be between atoms in peptide residues. Covalently-bound ligands can be included in the QM region when defining cuts, but only along with attached protein atoms. The QM region must extend at least as far as the first permissible cut between protein atoms.</p>
        <p>Hydrogen caps can be placed on any atom designated to be in the QM region, provided that it is singly-bonded to an atom in the MM region. This option offers much more flexibility in the selection of the QM region. The MM atom is replaced with a hydrogen atom in the QM calculation.</p>
        <p>If you have a metal in the structure it should either be added to the QM region, or it should be frozen in the MM region along with its ligands or ligand residues.</p>
        <p>See <a href="qsite_panel.html#rules">Rules and Procedures for Creating the QM/MM Boundary</a> for more detail.</p>

                        <p>To add entire amino acid residues to the QM region, choose this option and then pick two backbone atoms that are not alpha carbons and are at least three backbone bonds apart. The residues containing these two atoms and the residues in between are included in the QM region. The cut between MM and QM atoms is made between the alpha carbon and the backbone atom bonded to it. When you pick the first atom it is marked with a purple cube. After picking the second atom, all of the backbone and side chain atoms between the two cuts are marked in sienna (if <span class="GUI">Show markers</span> is selected). If you click twice on the same atom in an amino acid residue, then the QM/MM cuts will be set as small as possible so as to place that entire residue in the QM region.</p>

                        <p class="ListPara">There must be at least 3 bonds between pairs of QM-MM cuts that are made along the protein backbone. This ensures that the QM/MM boundaries are kept far enough apart that they do not interfere with one another. This means that the smallest QM region that contains all of the atoms of an amino acid residue would necessarily contain an extra carbonyl group and an extra N-H bond from the neighboring residues.</p>
                        <p class="ListPara">A backbone cut cannot be placed between an amino acid residue and an end cap. The end cap must be included in the QM region. To do this you may click on any atom in an end cap, and on any other atom in an amino acid residue further up the chain. In this case only one cut will actually be made, and all atoms from the cut to the end of the chain will be placed into the QM region.</p>

Three of the options on the menu are the same as in the <span class="GUI">QM Region</span> tab, and work in the same way. The <span class="GUI">Hydrogen cap</span> option is not present; instead there is an <span class="GUI">Atom</span> option that enables you to pick individual atoms.

                <p>Choose the basis set for the selected rows in the basis set table from this option menu. By default, the basis set used for the entire QM region is LACVP*, which uses 6-31G* for non-transition metals. This is the basis set used in the parameterization of the frozen orbital cuts.</p>
