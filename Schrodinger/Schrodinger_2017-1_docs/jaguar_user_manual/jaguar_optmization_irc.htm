        <p>Intrinsic Reaction Coordinate (IRC) calculations can be used to check that the given transition state is the expected transition state for the reaction of interest. IRC calculations start at a transition state and move downhill in energy along the reaction path toward a minimum of the potential energy surface, calculating a series of points in which all geometric variables orthogonal to the path are optimized. The points should lead towards the reactant and the product structures, but as a fixed number of points is calculated, the end points might not actually be reached.</p>
        <p>Jaguar has a variation of the IRC method that can be used for inexpensively verifying the transition state. In this variation, the first IRC point is calculated on either side of the transition state. The constraint to the reaction path is then removed and the geometry obtained from each IRC point is optimized to find a minimum. There is of course no guarantee that the minimum corresponds to the end point of the reaction, as the constraints to the path have been relaxed. However, if the minimum found does not correspond to the expected end point, it is possible that the potential energy surface is more complicated than expected, or that the transition state is not the correct one. In this case, reintroducing the constraint by computing a full IRC path is advisable. The variation can be requested by adding <code>three_pt_irc=1</code> to the <span class="Keyword">gen</span> section. You should also ensure that the step size in the IRC path is large enough to produce a substantial gradient at the first IRC point, otherwise the subsequent optimization may not produce the desired results.</p>
        <p>IRC scans have been implemented in Jaguar using the methods described in Ref. <a class="Reference_Number MCXref xref xrefReference_Number" href="jaguar_references.htm#jaguar_references_1926199490_242633">[<span style="color: #0e6895;" class="mcFormatColor">240</span>]</a>. The implementation includes both IRC and minimum energy path (MEP) calculations. The difference between the two is that the reaction coordinate for the IRC path is mass-weighted, whereas the reaction coordinate for the minimum energy path is not.</p>
        <p>IRC calculations can be set up from Maestro or by adding keywords to an input file (see <a class="TopicLink MCXref xref xrefTopicLink" href="../jaguar_command_reference/jaguar_input_gen_irc.htm#jaguar_input_1430212170_44903">Intrinsic Reaction Coordinate (IRC) Keywords In The Jaguar Input File</a>). To set up an IRC or minimum energy path calculation from Maestro, you must first perform a transition-state calculation and read in the restart file, then choose <span class="GUI">Tasks → Quantum Mechanics → Reaction Coordinate</span> in the Task Tool.</p>

        </p>
        <p>The lower part of the <span class="GUI">IRC</span> tab provides controls for the molecular charge, the spin multiplicity, the application of molecular symmetry, and the basis set. You can enter the charge and spin multiplicity in text boxes, or you can use values that are listed in the Project Table. If you choose the latter, you can create the corresponding properties and enter values for them if they don’t exist. You can choose the basis set from the Basis set option menu, and specify polarization and diffuse functions. See <a class="TopicLink MCXref xref xrefTopicLink" href="jaguar_options_basis_set.htm#jaguar_options_2333515368_199025">Basis Sets</a> for information on basis sets.</p>
        <p>By default, Jaguar takes advantage of molecular symmetry in order to obtain CPU savings. Both Abelian and non-Abelian point groups are recognized. However, if the transition state has a higher symmetry than other points on the reaction path, you should turn symmetry off, or lower it. You can select whether to use the full symmetry,<a href="javascript:void(0);" class="MCTextPopup popup popupHead" style="font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super">1<span class="MCTextPopupBody MCTextPopupBody_Closed needs-pie popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"></span>Keyword isymm = 8 in the gen section.</span></a> Abelian symmetry (D2h and subgroups),<a href="javascript:void(0);" class="MCTextPopup popup popupHead" style="font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super">2<span class="MCTextPopupBody MCTextPopupBody_Closed needs-pie popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"></span>Keyword isymm = 8 and idoabe=1 in the gen section.</span></a> or turn the use of symmetry off<a href="javascript:void(0);" class="MCTextPopup popup popupHead" style="font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super">3<span class="MCTextPopupBody MCTextPopupBody_Closed needs-pie popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"></span>Keyword isymm = 0 in the gen section.</span></a> in the <span class="GUI">Symmetry</span> option menu. For information on how to make sure the symmetry of your input structure is treated as you expect, see <a class="TopicLink MCXref xref xrefTopicLink" href="jaguar_from_maestro_clean_geom_symmetrize.htm#jaguar_from_maestro_705246280_132211">Symmetrizing a Molecule</a>.</p>
        <p>The calculation requires an accurate Hessian for the transition state. You can precalculate the Hessian and read it in from the restart file, or calculate the Hessian as part of the IRC or MEP calculation. To read the Hessian, choose <span class="GUI">Other</span><a href="javascript:void(0);" class="MCTextPopup popup popupHead" style="font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super">4<span class="MCTextPopupBody MCTextPopupBody_Closed needs-pie popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"></span>Keyword inhess = 2 in the gen section.</span></a> from the <span class="GUI">Initial Hessian</span> option menu in the <span class="GUI">Optimization</span> tab; to calculate the Hessian, choose <span class="GUI">Quantum-mechanical</span>.<a href="javascript:void(0);" class="MCTextPopup popup popupHead" style="font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super">5<span class="MCTextPopupBody MCTextPopupBody_Closed needs-pie popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"></span>Keyword inhess = 4 in the gen section.</span></a> Do not use any of the other options from this menu, because it is important to have an accurate Hessian. </p>
        <p>If you precalculate the Hessian and read it in, the symmetry of the transition state is used for the entire calculation. If the IRC path breaks symmetry, you should turn symmetry off (in the <span class="GUI">IRC</span> tab). If you calculate the Hessian as part of the IRC or MEP calculation, symmetry is turned off in the Hessian evaluation and remains off for the remainder of the run.</p>
        <p>IRC and MEP calculations can be run in either direction from the transition state. You can select the direction of the scan from the <span class="GUI">Direction</span> option menu in the <span class="GUI">IRC</span> tab.<a href="javascript:void(0);" class="MCTextPopup popup popupHead" style="font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super">6<span class="MCTextPopupBody MCTextPopupBody_Closed needs-pie popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"></span>Keyword ircmode in the gen section.</span></a> The direction of the reaction coordinate can be defined by supplying the reactant structure and the product structure in the <span class="GUI">Structures</span> section of the <span class="GUI">IRC</span> tab. These geometries are selected in the same way as for a transition state search—see <a class="TopicLink MCXref xref xrefTopicLink" href="jaguar_optmization_tst_structures.htm#jaguar_optimization_4029772162_153239">Specifying Structures for the Reaction</a>. The same rules for atom numbering in the reactant and product structures apply as for transition state searches. If you do not supply the reactant and product structures, Jaguar defines the forward direction using the rules described in <a class="TopicLink MCXref xref xrefTopicLink" href="../jaguar_command_reference/jaguar_input_gen_irc.htm#jaguar_input_1430212170_44903">Intrinsic Reaction Coordinate (IRC) Keywords In The Jaguar Input File</a>.</p>
        <p>You can run an IRC scan from a point that is not a transition state, by selecting <span class="GUI">Downhill</span> from the <span class="GUI">Direction</span> option menu,<a href="javascript:void(0);" class="MCTextPopup popup popupHead" style="font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super">7<span class="MCTextPopupBody MCTextPopupBody_Closed needs-pie popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"></span>Keyword ircmode = downhill in the gen section.</span></a> and providing the geometry as if it were a transition state. For these calculations, you do not need an initial guess of the Hessian. The scan follows the grad-ient from the initial point. Downhill mode is set automatically in the restart file for IRC jobs. </p>
        <p>The default calculation generates 6 points in both forward (toward the products) and backward (toward the reactants) directions from the transition state, at an interval of 0.1 in the reaction coordinate. You can enter the number of points in the <span class="GUI">Number of IRC points</span> text box,<a href="javascript:void(0);" class="MCTextPopup popup popupHead" style="font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super">8<span class="MCTextPopupBody MCTextPopupBody_Closed needs-pie popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"></span>Keyword ircmax in the gen section.</span></a> and the step size in the IRC step size text box.<a href="javascript:void(0);" class="MCTextPopup popup popupHead" style="font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super">9<span class="MCTextPopupBody MCTextPopupBody_Closed needs-pie popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"></span>Keyword ircstep in the gen section.</span></a> You can also limit the number of geometry optimization steps at each point in the <span class="GUI">Maximum optimization steps per point</span> text box.<a href="javascript:void(0);" class="MCTextPopup popup popupHead" style="font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super">10<span class="MCTextPopupBody MCTextPopupBody_Closed needs-pie popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"></span>Keyword ircmxcyc in the gen section.</span></a> This value overrides any value set in the <span class="GUI">Optimization</span> tab.</p>
        <p>Finally, for an IRC calculation, <span class="GUI">Use mass-weighted coordinates</span> must be selected.<a href="javascript:void(0);" class="MCTextPopup popup popupHead" style="font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super">11<span class="MCTextPopupBody MCTextPopupBody_Closed needs-pie popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"></span>Keyword irc = 2 in the gen section.</span></a> For an MEP calculation, this option must be deselected.<a href="javascript:void(0);" class="MCTextPopup popup popupHead" style="font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super">12<span class="MCTextPopupBody MCTextPopupBody_Closed needs-pie popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"></span>Keyword irc = 1 in the gen section.</span></a></p>
        <p>When the calculation finishes, the structures at the IRC (or MEP) points are automatically incorporated as separate entries in the Project Table, and the reaction coordinate is incorporated as a property. You can then sort the entries based on this property, and display them in sequence using the ePlayer.
