        <p>The Prime energy and its components from an Analyze Energy job, a WM/MM job, or an MM-GBSA job can be visualized in the Workspace, by using the <span class="GUI">Prime Energy Visualizer</span> panel. This panel also supports visualization of other properties, such as the partial charge, ligand strain, solvent accessibility, residue interactions, and membrane permeability. The visualization colors the structure and an optional molecular surface by the values of a chosen property or sum of properties. </p>
        <p>To open the <span class="GUI">Prime Energy Visualizer</span> panel, choose <span class="GUI">Tasks → Structure Analysis → Proten Analysis → Energy Visualizer</span> in the Task Tool.</p>

The option menu shows all possible choices, but there might not be values for the properties for all of these choices, depending on the calculations you performed for the Workspace structure. </p>
        <p class="Indented1">If the Workspace structure does not have the required properties, the area under <span class="GUI">Property</span> is replaced with a warning message indicating what type of job to run to generate the data, and a button is displayed to open the panel for setting up and running the job. For properties from a Prime energy calculation, a <span class="GUI">Calculate</span> button is shown, which runs the energy calculation with the default settings, and Maestro is unavailable while the job runs. For large structures, the job may take several minutes, so it may be better to run the job from the <span class="GUI">Calculate Energy</span> panel. The panel also provides access to the other controls that are available in the <span class="GUI">Calculate Energy</span> panel, if you want to use nondefault settings.</p>

Residue interactions are automatically visualized, so these controls are unavailable if you select <span class="GUI">Prime energy (residue interactions)</span>.</p>
        <p>If you want to modify the color scheme settings, or create surfaces, click <span class="GUI">Colors and Surfaces</span> to display the controls for doing so. You can hide the controls by clicking the button again.</p>
        <p>Four color schemes are available from the <span class="GUI">Scheme</span> option menu: red-white-green, red-white-blue, red-blue, and rainbow. The blue or green values represent low energies or favorable values, the red values represent high energies or unfavorable values. In addition, you can choose <span class="GUI">None</span> to color the atoms by element. This can be useful when labeling atoms by the property values rather than coloring them. </p>
        <p>If you want to label the atoms with the property values, select <span class="GUI">Label atoms</span>. The labels are colored by the atom color. </p>
        <p>The color schemes are actually color ramps, for which the numerical values for the currently selected properties are mapped to colors. The ramp is simply defined by a minimum and maximum value: anything below the minimum is colored the same as the minimum, and anything above the maximum is colored the same as the maximum. Values in between are scaled linearly along the currently selected color ramp. </p>
        <p>You can choose the following settings for the ranges represented by the ramp, from the <span class="GUI">Ramping</span> option menu:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p class="ListPara"><span class="GUI">Fixed</span>—Use hard-wired minimum and maximum values that were chosen to give the most broadly useful range of colors. Each property has its own minimum and maximum values that are set according to the usual range of property values. If multiple properties are shown, the minimum and maximum values are set to the smallest of the minimum values for the selected properties and the largest of the maximum values.</p>
                <p class="ListPara">Many of the terms have different inherent ranges. For example, the range for <span class="GUI">Pi-Pi packing</span> is [-0.08,0.08], whereas the range for <span class="GUI">Electrostatic</span> is [-20.0,20.0]. If you visualize <span class="GUI">Pi-Pi packing</span> by itself, the overall ramp will be [-0.08,0.08], and the various pi-pi interactions will show up as strong blue. However, visualizing <span class="GUI">Pi-Pi packing</span> in combination with <span class="GUI">Electrostatic</span> means the overall ramp will be [-20.0,20.0], and the pi-pi contributions will be very subtle in comparison to the electrostatic contributions.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p class="ListPara"><span class="GUI">Adaptive</span>—Use the maximum and minimum values over the currently selected properties as the end points for the color This choice can be useful for amplifying the differences in the current structure, to better differentiate the variations. However, if the properties only have favorable values, some of these values are colored red, which otherwise indicates that the values are unfavorable. In this context it means that they are the least favorable.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p class="ListPara"><span class="GUI">Custom</span>—Use the values given in the <span class="GUI">Min</span> and <span class="GUI">Max</span> text boxes as the ends of the ramp. These values are applied to all properties, which places them on the same scale. You can use the <span class="GUI">Auto-detect</span> button to set the values in the <span class="GUI">Min</span> and <span class="GUI">Max</span> text boxes to the minimum and maximum property values found in the Workspace structure. </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The changes in color from one part of the structure to another can be smoothed out to some extent by using the <span class="GUI">Color smoothing</span> slider. Increasing the smoothing spreads the color over neighboring atoms by performing some averaging over the property values. </p>
        <p>It can be useful to display values for different structural units, such as residues. The values are summed over all atoms in the structural unit. You can merge values for hydrogens into the attached heavy atoms, or merge values for entire residues, by choosing from the <span class="GUI">Merge values for</span> option menu.</p>
        <p>If you want to view the values on a surface, rather than the structure itself, click <span class="GUI">Create Surface </span>in the <span class="GUI">Surfaces</span> tab. A molecular surface is created and colored by the color of the nearest atom. The color is updated as you change the property that is used to color the atoms, so it is only necessary to create one surface. The resolution of the grid used to create the surface, and hence the quality of the surface, can be selected from the <span class="GUI">Resolution</span> option menu. Once you have created a surface, you can show or hide it with the <span class="GUI">Hide surface</span> option, which allows you to switch between viewing properties on the surface and on the structure.</p>
        <p>You can choose a surface style, from <span class="GUI">Solid</span>, <span class="GUI">Dot</span>, or <span class="GUI">Mesh</span>, and you can set the transparency of the surface (for solid surfaces) using the <span class="GUI">Transparency</span> sliders.
