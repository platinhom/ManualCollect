        <h1 class="Title">Output of Atomic Fukui Indices</h1>
        <p>Jaguar calculates atomic Fukui indices according to the method specified in Refs <a class="Reference_Number MCXref xref xrefReference_Number" href="../jaguar_user_manual/jaguar_references.htm#jaguar_references_1926199490_62753">[<span style="color: #0e6895;" class="mcFormatColor">243</span>]</a> and <a class="Reference_Number MCXref xref xrefReference_Number" href="../jaguar_user_manual/jaguar_references.htm#jaguar_references_1926199490_45905">[<span style="color: #0e6895;" class="mcFormatColor">244</span>]</a>. These indices are based on Fukui functions, which are partial derivatives of the electron or spin density with respect to a change in either the electron count or the unpaired spin count. A change in the electron count would be induced by reaction with another molecule, or by any external charge transfer mechanism. A change in the number of unpaired electron spins would be induced by electromagnetic radiation so as to produce an electronically excited state of different spin multiplicity.</p>
        <p>Due to the assumption of the frozen-orbital approximation, the Fukui functions may be simply calculated from the MO expansion coefficients and the atomic basis functions. The integrated Fukui functions may then be calculated in terms of the MO expansion coefficients and the atomic overlap matrix elements. In this form the integrated Fukui functions are calculated the same way as Mulliken populations. It follows that the atomic Fukui index denoted f_NN for the HOMO is simply half of the atom’s contribution to the Mulliken population of the HOMO. (The factor of one half is due to the fact that the Fukui function for the electron density integrates to 1, while the Mulliken population of a filled molecular orbital is 2.)</p>
        <p>Atomic Fukui indices are an attempt to quantify the anticipated reactivity of a molecule in various types of reactions. For a given reference atom in a series of related molecules, one can rank the molecules according to the values of a particular Fukui index for that atom. Each index includes two subscripts, N or S, which represent the electron density and the spin density, respectively. The two indices indicate the nature of the partial derivative on which the index is based. The first index indicates the property that responds to a change in the property indicated by the second index. Thus, f_NS indicates the change in the electron density about an atom when the molecule undergoes a reaction in which its spin multiplicity changes. Usually the f_NN indices are of interest, because the other indices require a change in either the spin density or the spin multiplicity.</p>
        <p> The f_NN HOMO indices are related to the f- Fukui function, and the f_NN LUMO indices are related to the f+ Fukui function. (The f- and f+ functions are calculated by the <code>fukui.py</code> script as discussed in <a class="TopicLink MCXref xref xrefTopicLink" href="../jaguar_user_manual/jaguar_workflows_fukui.htm#jaguar_workflows_3463797015_67392">Fukui Functions</a>.) Both atomic Fukui indices and Fukui functions are intended to predict and quantify relative reactivity. Sometimes the Fukui indices are called “condensed-to-atom Fukui functions”, but in practice the Fukui indices may or may not be derived from the Fukui functions themselves. In Jaguar, the atomic Fukui indices are calculated only for the N-electron system, using only the MO coefficients from the frontier orbitals. Fukui functions are molecular properties, and are calculated as differences in the electron density between the N-electron system on the one hand, and the N+<span class="Symbol">d </span>and N-<span class="Symbol">d </span>systems on the other hand (<span class="Symbol">d</span>=0.01 by default—see <a class="TopicLink MCXref xref xrefTopicLink" href="../jaguar_user_manual/jaguar_workflows_fukui.htm#jaguar_workflows_3463797015_67392">Fukui Functions</a>). Thus the Fukui functions depend upon all of the occupied orbitals, and they allow for the effects of electronic relaxation upon ionization of the molecule.</p>
        <p>A high positive value of f_NN for the HOMO indicates that the atom can donate electrons, and thus behaves as a nucleophile. A high positive value of f_NN for the LUMO indicates that the atom can receive electrons, and thus behaves as an electrophile. </p>

        <p>The nitrogen atom in pyridine is known to be somewhat nucleophilic, and this is reflected in the large positive value of f_NN for the HOMO. The HOMO is dominated by the lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom. When pyridine reacts, these electrons are donated to form the new bond to the other molecule, and thus are lost from the HOMO.</p>
        <p>If pyridine were considered as an electrophile, you would look at the f_NN values for the LUMO. In this case the largest index is that for the para carbon atom. Note that the f_NN value for the nitrogen atom is large in both the HOMO and LUMO, suggesting that it could act as an  electrophile or a nucleophile, whereas experimentally it is generally known as a nucleophile only. The large f_NN LUMO value is a consequence of the fact that the LUMO has large components on the out-of-plane p orbital on the nitrogen atom. In fact it is often the case that the same atoms will have large Fukui indices for both HOMO and LUMO, and this reflects the fact that the HOMO and LUMO tend to localize on the same atoms. For this reason, atomic Fukui indices are not reliable for identifying the most reactive nucleophilic or electrophilic site within a particular molecule. They are more useful in finding trends in reactivity for a chosen atomic site in a series of related molecules.</p>
        <p>Some points to remember:</p>
        <ul class="ListCompact">
            <li value="1">The values for f_NN and f_SS sum to 1
    </li>
            <li value="2">The values for f_NS and f_SN sum to 0
    </li>
            <li value="3">The values for f_SN are zero for all atoms if you use a spin-restricted formalism when performing the calculation.
    </li>
        </ul>
        <p>f_NN and f_SS are normally positive numbers for all atoms. Negative values are artifacts, and will usually be negligibly small in magnitude. These artifacts have the same origin as negative Mulliken populations.</p>
