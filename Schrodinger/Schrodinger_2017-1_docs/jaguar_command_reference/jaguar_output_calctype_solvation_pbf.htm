        <h1 class="Title">Output from a Jaguar PBF Calculation</h1>
        <p>Performing a solvation calculation involves several iterations in which the wave functions for the molecule in the gas phase are calculated. The program <code>ch</code> performs electrostatic potential fitting, which represents the wave function as a set of point charges on the atomic centers. The interactions between the molecule and the solvent are evaluated by Jaguar’s Poisson-Boltzmann solver, which fits the field produced by the solvent dielectric continuum to another set of point charges. These charges are passed back to <code>scf</code>, which performs a new calculation of the wave function for the molecule in the field produced by the solvent point charges. Electrostatic potential fitting is performed on the new wave function, the solvent-molecule interactions are reevaluated by the Poisson-Boltzmann solver, and so on, until the solvation free energy for the molecule converges.</p>
        <p>For solvation calculations on neutral systems in water whose atoms all have atomic numbers under 19 (H&#8209;Ar), by default, the program <code>pre</code> evaluates the Lewis dot structure for the molecule or system and assigns atomic van der Waals radii accordingly. (For more information on this process, see <a class="TopicLink MCXref xref xrefTopicLink" href="jaguar_files_pbfradii.htm#jaguar_files_3527134811_172276" xrefformat="{paratext}">The PBF Radii File for Jaguar Calculations</a>.) These van der Waals radii are used to form the boundary between the solvent dielectric continuum and the solute molecule. The Lewis dot structure and van der Waals radii information both appear in the output from the program <code>pre</code>. The radii are listed under the heading “vdw2” in the table of atomic information below the listing of non-default options. See <a class="TopicLink MCXref xref xrefTopicLink" href="jaguar_input_atomic.htm#jaguar_input_1430212170_645129" xrefformat="{paratext}">The atomic Section Of The Jaguar Input File</a>, which describes the <span class="Keyword">atomic</span> section of the input file, if you want information on the other information in this table.</p>
        <p>After the <code>pre</code> output, the usual output appears for the first, gas-phase calculation, except that the energy breakdown for the <code>scf</code> output also describes the electron-nuclear and kinetic contributions to the total one-electron terms in the energy, as well as the virial ratio −V/T, where V is the potential energy and T is the kinetic energy. This ratio should be −2 if the calculation satisfies the virial theorem.</p>
        <p>After the first <code>scf</code> output, the output from the first run of the program <code>ch</code> appears. Since performing a solvation calculation enables electrostatic potential fitting to atomic centers, the usual output for that option, which is described in <a class="TopicLink MCXref xref xrefTopicLink" href="jaguar_output_calctype_properties.htm#jaguar_output_1339368202_113488" xrefformat="{paratext}">Output for Jaguar Properties</a>, is included every time output from the program <code>ch</code> appears in the output file. The <code>post</code> program writes out the necessary input files for the Poisson-Boltzmann solver; this step is noted in the output file.</p>
        <p>The next output section comes from the Poisson-Boltzmann solver. The output includes information on the area (in Å<sup>2</sup>) of the molecular surface formed from the intersection of spheres with the van der Waals radii centered on the various atoms; the reaction field energy in kT (where T = 298 K), which is the energy of the interaction of the atom-centered charges with the solvent; the solvent-accessible surface area (in Å<sup>2</sup>), which reflects the surface formed from the points whose closest distance from the molecular surface is equal to the probe radius of the solvent; and the cavity energy in kT, which is computed to be the solvation energy of a nonpolar solute whose size and shape are the same as those of the actual solute molecule, as described in reference <a class="Reference_Number MCXref xref xrefReference_Number" href="../jaguar_user_manual/jaguar_references.htm#jaguar_references_1926199490_22465" xrefformat="[{color #0E6895}{paranumonly}{/color}]">[<span style="color: #0e6895;" class="mcFormatColor">15</span>]</a>.</p>
        <p>The output from the program <code>solv</code> follows the Poisson-Boltzmann solver results, giving the number of point charges provided by the solver to model the solvent, the sum of the surface charges, the nuclear repulsion energy already calculated by Jaguar, the nuclear-point charge energy representing the energy of interaction between the molecule’s nuclei and the solvent point charges, and the point-charge repulsion energy, which is calculated but not used by the rest of Jaguar because it is irrelevant to the desired solvation results.</p>
        <p>Next, the output for the second solvation iteration begins. The output from <code>scf</code> comes first, giving the results for the molecule-and-solvent-point-charges system. The following is the output of the scf program for a HF/6-31g** calculation on water in cyclohexane:</p><pre>

        <p>As for any later solvation iterations, the <code>scf</code> output begins with the calculation type and the table of energy results for each iteration, skipping the list of information about the molecule’s electrons and orbitals. The energy information below the table includes several additional terms, whose relations to each other are described with the usual alphabetic labels. First, the total of the terms with no electron contribution is listed (term (A)), followed by terms (B) and (C), the nuclear-nuclear and nuclear-solvent energies.</p>
        <p>Next, the total one-electron energy is listed, along with its three components, the electron-nuclear, electron-solvent, and kinetic energies. The total two-electron energy, and the total of the one- and two-electron energies, the electronic energy, follow. Term (N), the total of the zero-, one-, and two-electron terms, is then listed, with the label “Total quantum mech. energy.” This term corresponds to the final energy from the <code>scf</code> energy table for that iteration, and includes the entire energies for the molecule-solvent interactions.</p>
        <p>The output next includes the gas phase and the solution phase energies for the molecule, since these terms are, of course, necessary for solvation energy calculations. The first solution phase energy component is the total solute energy, which includes the nuclear-nuclear, electron-nuclear, kinetic, and two-electron terms, but no terms involving the solvent directly. The second component of the solution phase energy is the total solvent energy, which is computed as half of the total of the nuclear-solvent and electron-solvent terms, since some of its effect has already changed the solute energy. Third, a solute cavity term, which computes the solvation energy of a nonpolar solute of identical size and shape to the actual solute molecule, as described in reference <a class="Reference_Number MCXref xref xrefReference_Number" href="../jaguar_user_manual/jaguar_references.htm#jaguar_references_1926199490_22465" xrefformat="[{color #0E6895}{paranumonly}{/color}]">[<span style="color: #0e6895;" class="mcFormatColor">15</span>]</a>, is included. This is only done for water as solvent. The last solution phase energy component (shown only if it is nonzero) is term (T), the first shell correction factor, which depends on the functional groups in the molecule, with atoms near the surface contributing most heavily.</p>
        <p>Finally, the list ends with the reorganization energy and the solvation energy. The reorganization energy is the difference between the total solute energy and the gas phase energy, and does not explicitly contain solvent terms. The final solvation energy is calculated as the solution phase energy described above minus the gas phase energy.</p>
        <p>The results of the self-consistent reaction field iterations so far performed are summarized after the <code>scf</code> output in the output from the program <code>sole</code>. An example from the final SCRF iteration of water in cyclohexane follows:</p><pre>

        <p>The solvation energy is listed in Hartrees and in kcal/mol, and the note below it reads either <code>solvation energy not yet converged...</code> or <code>stopping: solvation energy converged</code>, depending on whether the solvation energy has changed by less than the <span class="GUI">Solvation convergence</span> criterion, which is described in <a class="TopicLink MCXref xref xrefTopicLink" href="../jaguar_user_manual/jaguar_options_solvation.htm#jaguar_options_2333515368_24251" xrefformat="{paratext}">Jaguar Solvation Settings</a>. If the solvation energy has converged, the output from the <code>sole</code> program includes a line summarizing the solvation energy iterations and result.</p>
        <p>The output from <code>ch</code> and <code>post</code> appears below the <code>sole</code> output. If the solvation energy has converged, the <code>ch</code> output reflects the system’s final atomic charges. If the solvation energy has not converged, these charges and the Poisson-Boltzmann solver’s files generated by the <code>post</code> program are passed to the solver again, and the solvation iterations continue as previously described, until solvation energy convergence is reached.</p>
