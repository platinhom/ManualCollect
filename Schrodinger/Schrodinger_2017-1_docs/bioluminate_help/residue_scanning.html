        <h1 class="title">Residue Scanning Panel</h1><a name="summary"></a>
        <p>In this panel you can scan a protein for residues that are candidates for mutation, using homology modeling to identify variable or conserved residues, solvent-accessible surface area to identify surface residues, distances to identify contacts with other residues, surface shape complementarity, and manual selection. The mutations can then be defined and applied to produce mutated structures. Mutations are applied independently to produce a set of structures with single mutations. This process can be repeated automatically to optimize the stability of the protein or the affinity of two parts of the protein for each other.</p>
        <p class="opening">To open this panel, choose <span class="GUI">Tasks → Biologics → Residue Scanning/Affinity Maturation → Perform Calculations</span> in the Task Tool.</p>
        <h2><a name="using"></a>Using the Residue Scanning Panel</h2>
        <p>The basic workflow is as follows:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>Import a structure into the workflow, either from the Workspace or from a Maestro file (<span class="GUI">Import structure from</span>).</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>Choose the calculation type. Stability is always calculated, affinity can be calculated if there is more than one chain.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>If you chose to calculate affinity, select the chains for one of the partners in the binding affinity calculation.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p>Choose the mutations for the residues you want to mutate.</p>
                <p>You can do this by clicking in the <span class="GUI">Mutations</span> column of the table and selecting from the option menu that is displayed, or using the <span class="GUI">Mutate ... to</span> tools to set mutations for multiple residues simultaneously, or clicking the <span class="GUI">Homology Criteria</span> button and selecting residues and their mutations by homology modeling or structural criteria.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="5">
                <p>If you want to optimize the stability or binding affinity, select <span class="GUI">Perform affinity maturation</span> in the <span class="GUI">Options</span> tab, and choose an optimization procedure.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="6">
                <p>Choose <span class="GUI">Job Settings</span> from the <span class="GUI">Settings</span> button menu,<br class="image" /> <img src="../Resources/Images/Toolbuttons/settings.png" /> <br class="image" />set the job parameters in the <span class="GUI">Job Settings</span> dialog box, and click <span class="GUI">Run</span> to run the job; or click <span class="GUI">Run</span> to run the job with the current job settings.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>A structure is produced for each mutation, and the structures are incorporated into the project as new entries when the job finishes. As the time taken scales linearly with the number of mutated structures produced, you should consider carefully how many mutations you make. The number of mutation sites and the total number of mutations (structures generated) is reported below the table.</p>
        <p>You can use suggestions from homology models for the residues to mutate, based on variability or conservation at residue postions, or on solvent accessibility or side-chain interactions. This is done by clicking <span class="GUI">Homology Criteria</span>, which opens the <span class="GUI">Homology Suggestions</span> dialog box:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>Run a search for homologs (<span class="GUI">Run a Blast Search</span>) and align the homologs (<span class="GUI">Align Homologs</span>).</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>Specify the criteria for automatic selection of residues, in the <span class="GUI">Selection by homology criteria</span> and <span class="GUI">Parent structure 3D criteria</span> sections.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>Click <span class="GUI">Select in the Residues Tab</span>.</p>
                <p>The <span class="GUI">Residues</span> tab is displayed and the residues are selected in the table. The default selection of mutations is based on the variations seen in the homologs.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Residue scanning for antibodies can be done in the <span class="GUI">Antibody Humanization: Residue Scanning</span> panel, which uses antibody databases to search for homologs in the antibody itself. The <span class="GUI">Residue Scanning</span> panel offers more general residue mutation capabilities, which can be used for antibodies—for example, if you want to mutate both the antibody and the antigen simultaneously.</p>

        <h3><a name="feature1"></a>Import tools</h3>
        <p>The import tools allow you to import a protein structure into the workflow for residue mutation. You can choose an option from the <span class="GUI">Import structure from</span> option menu to use the entire structure in the Workspace, the selected residues in the Workspace, or a structure from a Maestro file. For the first two options, click the <span class="GUI">Import</span> button to import and analyze the structure. If importing from a file, the button changes to <span class="GUI">Browse</span>, and you can click this button to open a file selector to locate and open the file.</p>
        <h3><a name="feature2"></a>Calculation type options</h3>
        <p>These options allow you to choose between calculating the protein stability as a result of mutation <span class="GUI">(Stability</span>), or to calculate both the stability and the affinity of one part of the protein for another (<span class="GUI">Stability and Affinity</span>). If you select the latter option, the <span class="GUI">Binding partners</span> tools are displayed so you can define the two parts of the protein.</p>
        <h3><a name="binding_partners"></a>Binding partners option menu</h3>
        <p>Choose the chains to use for one of the two binding partners for affinity calculations from this option menu. The remaining chains are assigned to the other partner. These tools are only available if you choose <span class="GUI">Stability and Affinity</span> for the calculation type.</p>
        <h3><a name="suggestions"></a>Homology Criteria button</h3>
        <p>Select residues to mutate based on suggestions from homologous proteins. When you click this button, the <a href="residue_scanning_homology_suggestions.html"><span class="GUI">Homology Suggestions</span> dialog box</a> opens, in which you can build a homology model for a chain and select residues by conservation or structural criteria. Clicking <span class="GUI">Save</span> in this dialog box selects the suggested residues in the residue table of the <span class="GUI">Residues</span> tab and sets the mutations for the residue to the residues in the homologs that differ from the query.</p>

factor for the distance between the points. The score is the normalized sum over
surface points, such that perfect complementarity (parallel normals) has a value
of 1, and no complementarity has a value of 0. It is evaluated over the buried
