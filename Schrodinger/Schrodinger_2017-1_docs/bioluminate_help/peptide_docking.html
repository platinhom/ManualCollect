        <h1 class="title">Peptide Docking Panel</h1><a name="summary"></a>
        <p>This panel allows you to set up and run a job to dock peptides to a protein using Glide. The protein is treated as a rigid structure, but with some softening of the potentials for flexibility; the peptides are treated as flexible structures.</p>
        <p class="opening">To open this panel, choose <span class="GUI">Tasks → Biologics → Peptide Docking</span> in the Task Tool.</p>
        <h2><a name="using"></a>Using the Peptide Docking Panel</h2>
        <p>Peptide docking is done with Glide, which treats the receptor as a rigid structure but with softening of the potentials in the active site region to simulate small adjustments of the receptor to the ligand. The peptide ligands are treated flexibly. As peptides are very flexible compared to more typical non-peptide ligands, the Glide docking is performed with increased sampling, and several docking runs are done for each peptide, with different input conformations, to further increase the sampling.</p>
        <p>With the Glide technology, peptides that have a diameter greater than 80&#160;Å cannot be docked due to the grid box size limit. This corresponds to a linear peptide of about 16 residues. Glide also restricts the number of rotatable bonds to 100, due to the rapid increase in the number of conformations with the number of rotatable bonds. The maximum peptide length that can be docked in practice will depend on the conformation and the residue types.</p>
        <p>Docking peptides is time consuming as there are many conformations to explore. A single peptide can take a few hours to dock. It it recommended that you run the job across multiple processors if you can, especially if you want to dock several peptides.</p>

                <p>The maximum number of residues in any peptide that will be docked is reported below the coordinates of the active site center.

The limit on the number of rotatable bonds is 100.</p>
