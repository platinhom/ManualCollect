        <h1 class="title">Toggle Table Panel</h1><a name="summary"></a>
        <p>This panel provides a means of interacting with the Workspace and the project that is similar to PyMOL.</p>
        <p class="opening">To open this panel, choose <span class="GUI">Window â†’ Toggle Table</span> in the Task Tool.</p>
        <h2><a name="using"></a>Using the Toggle Table Panel</h2>
        <p>The Toggle Table provides easy ways to manipulate the Workspace. Either the entire Workspace or individual entries can operated on. Menus provide easy ways to change the color, representation style, and labeling of entries. Various chemical features can be displayed or hidden, groups of atoms can be selected, and simple properties can be calculated.</p>
        <p>The central section of the Toggle Table lists all entries in the Workspace. Clicking on the name of an entry toggles the visibility of that entry. <b>However, it is important to note that even if an entry is not visible, it is still in the Workspace as long as it is listed in the Toggle Table. This means that all Workspace operations will be applied to this entry. Panels that offer to "Analyze the Workspace" or "Import from Workspace" will operate on these entries, even if they are not visible and the entry name is greyed out.</b>  To remove (exclude) an entry from the workspace, use the <span class="GUI">Remove from Workspace</span> command under the <span class="GUI">A</span> menu for that entry, or exclude it using the Project Table.</p>
        <p>In addition to the docked panel, the Toggle Table also provides a right-click context menu in the workspace for easy access to many of its features. This menu is available by right-clicking and holding anywhere in the workspace. The contents of the context menu depend on whether the click occurs on an atom (which selects the atom) or empty space.</p>

        <h3><a name="feature2"></a>Entries in the Workspace Region</h3>
        <p>This region of the Toggle Table has a row for each entry in the Workspace, plus additional types of objects. The buttons in these rows open menus that operate on the objects for that row.</p>
        <p>There are three distinct types of rows in this table:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1"><b>Entry rows</b>: These rows apply to a single entry that is currently in the workspace. The name of the row is the Title of the entry that its menu items apply to. Entry rows are deleted when the entry is excluded from the Workspace, and a new row is added when an entry is added to the Workspace</li>
            <li value="2"><b>The All row</b>: This row applies to all atoms in the Workspace.</li>
            <li value="3"><b>Selection rows</b>: When a group of atoms is selected, a Selection row is added to the Entry Region. Actions in this row apply to the group of atoms that was selected to create this row and even apply after those atoms are no longer selected. The Selection row named <span class="GUI">(Selection)</span> always refers to the most recent group of selected atoms. Selection rows can be renamed: renamed Selection rows always refer to the same set of atoms regardless of subsequent Workspace selections. Selection rows are deleted when any atoms they refer to are removed from the Workspace. Only one selection can be active at a time.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some operations or menu items change based on whether they are being applied to the All row, an Entry row, or a Selection row. The descriptions below describe the behavior for Entry rows. When a behavior changes for the All row or a Selection row, the change is noted after the description.</p>
        <p>Any Entry row in this table refers to an entry that is currently in the Workspace whether that entry is visible or not. This means that the entry it refers to is affected by actions in the All row, and also that it will be analyzed or imported by panels that operate on the Workspace.</p>
        <dl>
            <dt><a name="feature10a"></a><span class="GUI">Name</span>
            </dt>
            <dd>
                <p>Clicking on the name of an All or an Entry row toggles the visibility of that object in the Workspace. When the object's visibility is off, the name is greyed out.</p>
                <p><b>However, it is important to note that even if an entry is not visible, it is still in the Workspace as long as it is listed in the Toggle Table. This means that all Workspace operations are applied to this entry. Panels that offer to "Analyze the Workspace" or "Import from Workspace" will operate on these entries, even if they are not visible and the entry name is greyed out.</b>
                </p> 
For instance, if the Workspace contains ten entries and only one entry is
visible, selecting the <span class="GUI">Clean</span> action in the All row's
<span class="GUI">A</span> menu operates on all ten structures. This may
take a considerable amount of time to complete and lead to unexpected
results. Also, in this example, if a panel tries to Import from Workspace, it
attempts to import all ten structures rather than just the visible
structure.
<p><b>Note:</b> the interactions between toggling visiblity by clicking on the Name, hiding atoms with the various <span class="GUI">Hide</span> menu commands, and including/excluding entries from the Workspace can result in a situation where the name is not greyed out but no atoms are visible. Should this occur, simply choose to show the atoms using one of the commands in the <span class="GUI">Show</span> menu.</p><p>Clicking the name of a Selection row toggles the selection state of the atom group that row refers to. Any currently selected atoms that are not part of this atom group are deselected.</p></dd>

            <dd>
                <p>Opens the Show menu, also referred to as the <span class="GUI">S</span> menu.</p>
                <p>The Show menu contains commands that alter the display of structures in the Workspace. There are three different types of display for structures:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li value="1">Atomic representations such as lines, sticks, ball and sticks or spheres</li>
                    <li value="2">Ribbon representations such as ribbons and cartoons</li>
                    <li value="3">Surface representations such as solid or mesh surfaces</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Each atom may have one of each representation type active at once, but cannot have multiple representations of the same type active. For instance, an atom can be shown simultaneously with lines, cartoon ribbons and a mesh surface. However, an atom cannot be shown simultaneously by both ball and stick and sphere representations because they are both atomic representations. If an action is chosen to show an atom with a representation in the same category as an existing representation for that atom, the existing representation is removed and the atom is shown with the new representation. For instance, if an atom is shown as Lines, and the ball and stick menu item is chosen, the Lines representation is removed and the atom is shown with ball and stick representation.</p>

However, selecting them from the <span class="GUI">As</span> submenu removes any current representation of <i>any</i> of the three types for that atom and replaces them all with the selected representation. For instance, an atom shown with lines and cartoon ribbons is shown as only ball and stick if <span class="GUI">Show â†’ As â†’ Ball and Stick</span> is chosen, but are shown as cartoon and ball and stick if <span class="GUI">Show â†’ Ball and Stick</span> is chosen.</li>
