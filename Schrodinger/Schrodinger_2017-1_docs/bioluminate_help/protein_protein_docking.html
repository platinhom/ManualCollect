        <p>In this panel you can set up and run a job to dock a ligand protein to a receptor protein, an antibody to an antigen, or form a dimer or trimer of a single protein.</p>
        <h2><a name="using"></a>Using the Protein-Protein Docking Panel</h2>
        <p>The Protein-Protein Docking panel provides an interface to the Piper program, licensed from Acpharis.</p>
        <p>The basic algorithm is as follows. The ligand is rotated into a large number of different orientations with respect to the receptor, and each of the ligand orientations is translated to find the best docking score to the receptor. The top 1000 rotations are clustered using the RMS distance between matching atoms in each pair of rotated structures. The structure that is taken from each cluster is the one with the most neighbors in the cluster.</p>
        <p>The structures you use should be properly prepared for docking, which mainly means that the structure must have hydrogen atoms. This requirement is enforced when you import structures. Although you can import structures directly from the PDB, these structures often have missing atoms, and the missing atoms are often in surface residues. If these residues are important for protein-protein docking, you should consider running a side-chain prediction (<span class="GUI">Tasks → Protein Preparation and Refinement → Predict Side Chains</span>) to ensure that the critical side chain atoms are present in the structures that you dock. You can include a side-chain prediction in the process of protein preparation in the <a href="../protein_prep_help/protein_preparation.html"><span class="GUI">Protein Preparation Wizard</span></a>.</p>
        <p>The basic workflow is as follows:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>Choose the kind of system you want to dock, in the <span class="GUI">Mode</span> section. You can dock antibodies to antigens and generate dimers or trimers as well as docking two general proteins.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>Import or select the protein structures. This includes selecting the chains from the protein if it has multiple chains.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>Change settings for the ligand rotations and number of poses, if desired.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p>Set constraints for residues in the proteins to encourage docking in a particular region, if desired. See <a href="#feature5"><span class="GUI">Attraction and Repulsion</span> tab</a> and <a href="../bioluminate_user_manual/protein_protein_docking_constraints.htm" class="MCXref xref" xrefformat="{paratext}">Protein-Protein Docking Constraints</a>.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="5">
                <p>Set distance restraints for residues in the proteins to enforce docking in a particular region, if desired. See <a href="#feature8"><span class="GUI">Distance Restraints</span> tab</a> and <a href="../bioluminate_user_manual/protein_protein_docking_restraints.htm" class="MCXref xref" xrefformat="{paratext}">Protein-Protein Docking Distance Restraints</a>.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="6">
                <p>Start the docking job.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>The docking job can be distributed over multiple processors to improve turnaround time. You can set the number of processors to use in the <span class="GUI">Job Settings</span> dialog box.</p>
