        <h1 class="Title">Antibody Databases</h1>
        <p>Modeling antibodies is done with the help of a database of prepared antibody structures. A database is supplied with the distribution, and is the default database. You can create and manage your own databases in the <span class="GUI">Antibody Database Management</span>, which you open by choosing <span class="GUI">Tasks → Biologics → Antibody Modeling → Database Management</span> in the Task Tool.</p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="antibody_database_management.png" style="margin: 2px;" />
        </p>
        <p>Structures that are added to a database are automatically characterized and curated. Antibody structures and the light and heavy chains are identified using a similarity search against known antibodies, and structures that do not meet the similarity criteria are rejected. Then the constituent regions of the antibody chains, including the framework region, as well as the six hypervariable loops, are identified and annotated for use in subsequent predictions. </p>
        <p>When you first open the panel, the default database is loaded. Normally this database is installed by an administrator and you do not have write privileges, so it is opened read-only. You can import this database into your own database if you want, as described below. It is only necessary to do this if you want to modify the data in some way, because you can specify multiple databases for modeling. </p>
        <p>To open a database, or to create a new database, click <span class="GUI">Open/Create</span>. A file selector opens, and you can navigate to the desired location. If you want to open a database, select the database from the list of files. It should have the extension <code>.db</code>. If you want to create a new database, enter the name in the <span class="GUI">File name</span> text box.</p>
        <p>The structures in the database are shown in the antibody table. You can restrict the structures that are listed in the table by searching for strings in the table and only showing the rows that contain the string. By default, all visible text is searched, but you can change it by clicking <span class="GUI">Select</span> and choosing the columns you want to search on. To return to sorting all visible columns, click <span class="GUI">Reset</span>. The text box has a tool tip that explains the syntax for the search string, which can include relational operators, wild cards, regular expressions, and some special terms. </p>
        <p>The table shows only a few columns by default. If you want to see all the columns, by <span class="GUI">Show columns</span>, select <span class="GUI">All</span>. The full set of columns includes the identity (residue range) and length of each loop, and a range of information from the originating PDB structure. If you want to export the information in the columns to a CSV file, click <span class="GUI">Export Table</span>, and navigate to a location and name the file in the file selector that opens. </p>
        <p>To delete structures from the database, select them in the table and click <span class="GUI">Delete Selected Rows</span>. If you want to clear the entire database, click <span class="GUI">Delete All Data</span>. You should exercise care when deleting rows or all data, as these functions are not reversible.</p>
        <p>Structures can be added to the database from several sources, represented by buttons in the <span class="GUI">Add structures to database</span> section. In each case, the imported data is automatically processed for you: the antibody chains are identified, the constituent regions of the chains are determined, and all the pertinent information required for subsequent modeling is saved in a rapidly accessed format. You need only supply the antibody structures in PDB (or Maestro) format.</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p class="ListPara"><span class="GUI">Workspace</span>—import structures from the Workspace.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p class="ListPara"><span class="GUI">Files</span>—import structures from PDB files or Maestro files. Opens a file selector, in which you can navigate to and select multiple files for import.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p class="ListPara"><span class="GUI">Directory</span>—import all structures from a directory. Opens a directory selector, in which you can navigate to the directory to import from.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p class="ListPara"><span class="GUI">Database</span>—import structures from an existing database. Opens a file selector, in which you can navigate to and select the database (.db) to import from. Import progress is displayed in a bar at the bottom of the panel.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The structures are filtered to ensure that only those structures that have characteristics of antibodies are included in the database. You can alter the criteria for filtering structures in the <span class="GUI">Antibody Database - Advanced Options</span> dialog box, which you open by clicking <span class="GUI">Advanced Options</span>. You can also select the file types that are presented when importing structures from files.</p>
        <p>In the <span class="GUI">Minimum sequence identity</span> section, you can specify cutoffs for determining whether a structure should be included in the database, based on percentage sequence identity. If no chain in the structure passes the tests, it is not included in the database. A chain must meet the FR threshold and either the VL or VH threshold to be included in the database. If a chain meets only one of the VL or VH thresholds, it is only included as a light or heavy variable chain. </p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="antibody_database_management_options.png" style="margin: 2px;" />
        </p>
        <p>For the framework regions, you can specify which of the four framework regions to use in the similarity analysis, by selecting the options for FR1, FR2, FR3, or FR4 in the <span class="GUI">Framework regions used in similarity analysis</span> section.</p>
        <p>To revert to the default options, click <span class="GUI">Reset</span>. </p>
        <p>You can create a database from the command line using a set of sequences or structures with the following command:</p><pre>
$SCHRODINGER/run -FROM bioluminate build_antibody_database.py [<i class="UserReplace">options</i>]<br /><i class="UserReplace">database-file</i> <i class="UserReplace">input-files</i></pre>
        <p>You can omit the <code>$SCHRODINGER/</code> if you are running on Windows. For information on the command options, run the command with the <code>-h</code> option.</p>
        <p>The database file must have a <code>.db</code> extension. If you specify an existing database, the new entries are appended, otherwise a new database is created. The input files can be Fasta files or Maestro files. If you provide structures, they are used as is; if you provide sequences without structures, an Fv antibody model is built using the standard options for antibody prediction. </p>
