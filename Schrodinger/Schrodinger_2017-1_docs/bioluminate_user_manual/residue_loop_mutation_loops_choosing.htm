        <h1 class="Title">Choosing the Original and Replacement Loop</h1>
        <p>When the <span class="GUI">Insertions, Deletions, and Loop Swaps</span> panel opens, the sequence viewer at the top is loaded with the sequence of the structure in the Workspace. If you want to use a different s structure, you can replace the Workspace structure with another structure, or you can import a structure from a file or from the PDB. To load another structure, click <span class="GUI">Import</span>, and choose the source from the menu that is displayed. The choices are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p class="ListPara"><span class="GUI">Browse for File</span>—Open a file browser in which you can navigate to the desired location and select the file that contains the structure. The allowed file types are Maestro and PDB. </p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p class="ListPara"><span class="GUI">From PDB ID</span>—Import the structure from the specified PDB ID. Opens the <span class="GUI">Enter PDB ID</span> dialog box, in which you can enter the PDB ID of the sequence. The sequence and structures are retrieved from a local copy of the PDB if it is available, or from the RCSB web site, depending on the preference set for PDB retrieval.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p class="ListPara"><span class="GUI">From Workspace</span>—Import the structure that is displayed in the Workspace.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The sequence for the imported structure is added to the sequence viewer. This allows you to import multiple structures, and choose which structure to take a loop from.</p>
        <p>When you have the structure that you want to mutate, you can select the loop to mutate either in the Workspace or in the sequence viewer in the panel. </p>
        <p>Selecting the loop in the Workspace allows you to visually identify the loop. To ensure that you are picking residues in the Workspace to define the loop, choose <span class="GUI">Edit</span> → <span class="GUI">Pick Mode</span> → <span class="GUI">Residues</span>, or type the letter <span class="Keys">R</span> with the pointer in the Workspace. You can then pick residues that belong to the loop you are interested in. The residues that you pick are highlighted in the Workspace (yellow dots) and in the sequence viewer (white letter on blue background). </p>
        <p>Selecting the loop in the sequence viewer allows you to easily search for patterns in the sequence, or to use the secondary structure assignment (SSA) to identify loops. The SSA has no annotation where there are loops (the absence of any other secondary structure). To search for patterns in the sequence, enter the pattern in the <span class="GUI">Find Pattern</span> text box, with a dash separating each residue from the next, e.g. <code>D-A-P</code>. The syntax is summarized in the tool tip for the text box, and is given in more detail in <a class="TopicLink MCXref xref xrefTopicLink" href="reactive_residues_custom.htm#reactive_residues_2722908081_749231">Defining Custom Reactive Groups</a>. You can use the arrow keys to step through the patterns. All of the matches are selected in the Workspace, so you might have to select the loop that you want in the Workspace, or by clearing the Find Pattern text box, then selecting the residues to use. </p>
        <p>When you select the residues for the loop to mutate, you should select at least two residues on either side of the residues that you plan to modify. These extra residues are “stem” residues, which are used by the Prime software when rebuilding the loop, to properly fit the new loop onto the structure. For example, if a single residue is being deleted, the original loop should consist of five residues - the residue to delete and the two residues on either side of it.</p>
        <p>After you have selected the residues, click <span class="GUI">Workspace Selection</span> in the <span class="GUI">Original loop</span> section, to register the selection and copy the structure for the loop mutation job. The original loop is used by default for the replacement loop, which you can modify as described in the next section. </p>
        <p>If you want to replace the loop with a loop from another structure, you can place another structure in the Workspace, and select a loop from this structure. If the structure is not already in the sequence viewer, you can import it as described above. You can also select the loop in the same way as for the original loop. </p>
        <p>You might want to align the sequence for the replacement to the sequence for the original structure, so that you can select the loop by its alignment. To do the alignment, make sure that the original sequence is at the top of the sequence viewer (use the shortcut menu for the sequence name to move it if necessary), and add the replacement sequence to the selected sequences. You can then use either the pairwise alignment tool or the multiple alignment tool to align the sequences (using ClustalW). </p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Toolbuttons/msv_pairwise_align.png" style="margin-left: 2px;margin-right: 2px;margin-top: 2px;margin-bottom: 2px;" />
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Toolbuttons/msv_multiple_align.png" style="margin-left: 2px;margin-right: 2px;margin-top: 2px;margin-bottom: 2px;" />
        </p>
        <p>You can also do manual alignment, with locking and unlocking of gaps. See the <a href="../maestro_tools_help/multiple_sequence_viewer.html">Multiple Sequence Viewer Panel</a> document for more information on doing manual alignment. </p>
        <p>When you have selected the residues in the desired structure for the replacement loop, click <span class="GUI">Workspace Selection</span> in the <span class="GUI">Replacement loop</span> selection. If you decide not to use this loop, you can click <span class="GUI">Set to Original Loop</span> to change the replacement loop back to the original loop structure.</p>
