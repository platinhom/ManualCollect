<h2>Summary</h2>

<p> The <span class="GUI">Adjust</span> panel allows the adjustments of
dihedral angles, bond angles, atom distances, and inversion at all or
selected chiral centers. </p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Adjust Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Adjust</span> panel:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Edit &rarr; Adjust 
&rarr; </span><i>parameter</i></p></li>
</ul>

<a name="using"></a>
<h2>Using the Adjust Panel</h2>

<p>To adjust a distance, angle or dihedral, follow the steps below. 
Chirality behaves differently, see <a href="#feature6"><span
class="GUI">Chirality</span></a>. </p>

<p>To make an adjustment:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the appropriate tab: <span class="GUI">Distance</span>,
<span class="GUI">Angle</span>, or <span class="GUI">Dihedral</span>.</li>
<li>Define a geometric parameter (distance, angle, dihedral) by selecting atoms
or bonds in the Workspace.</li> 
<li>Adjust the parameter by using one of the following methods:</li>
<ul><li>Enter a value in the <span class="GUI">Current</span> column of the table</li>
<li>Drag horizontally with the left mouse button.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p><b>Note:</b> You can use the middle and right mouse buttons to rotate and
translate the molecule (global transformation) while doing adjustments.
</p>
<p>If you are adjusting a dihedral of a protein, you can click <span
class="GUI">Dihedral</span> and choose the dihedral from a list.
</p>


<h3>Defining parameters</h3>

<p>To define a geometric parameter to adjust, choose <span class="GUI">Atoms</span>
or <span class="GUI">Bonds</span> from the <span class="GUI">Pick</span> menu (see
<a href="../misc/picking_controls.html">Picking Controls</a>). Then,
depending on what you wish to adjust, select the appropriate number of items:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Bond length:</b> select 2 atoms or 1 bond</li>
<li><b>Bond angle:</b> select 3 atoms or 2 bonds</li>
<li><b>Dihedral angle:</b> select 4 atoms or one bond (the bond about which the rotation is
performed)</li>
</ul>

<p>The order in which atoms are selected determines how the adjustment is made.
The atom that was picked last is the atom that is moved in the adjustment, and is
called the <i>moving</i> atom.  The controls in the
<a href="#feature5"><span class="GUI">Move</span></a>
section determine whether only the moving atom is moved, or whether atoms attached to
it are moved as well.</p>

<p> When a parameter is defined, it is marked in the Workspace and an entry is created in the
table in the <span class="GUI">Adjust</span> panel.</p>

<p> The marker includes four parts and are color-coded by the type of parameter being adjusted: </p>

<table cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" border="1">
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>Distance</td>
<td>Angle</td>
<td>Dihedral</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Solid lines through atoms</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td align="middle" bgcolor="lime">green</td>
<td align="middle" bgcolor="red">red</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dashed lines representing adjustment</td>
<td align="middle" bgcolor="fuchsia">purple</td>
<td align="middle" bgcolor="lime">green</td>
<td align="middle" bgcolor="red">red</td>

<td align="middle" bgcolor="yellow">yellow</td>
<td align="middle" bgcolor="#ff8040">orange</td>
<td align="middle" bgcolor="aqua">turquoise</td>
</tr>
</table>


<h3>Adjusting Parameters</h3>

<p> Once a parameter has been defined, you can adjust it in three ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>Drag horizontally with the the left mouse button </li>
<li>Enter a new value in the <span class="GUI">Current</span> field of the
highlighted entry in the table.</li>
<li>Scroll with the mouse wheel</li>
</ul>

<h2>Adjust Panel Features</h2>

<p>The <span class="GUI">Adjust</span> panel has four tabs. Three of these,
<span class="GUI">Angle</span>, <span class="GUI">Distance</span>,
and <span class="GUI">Dihedral</span>, have identical structure.
The fourth tab, <span class="GUI">Chirality</span>, is different. The following
sections describe the features of each of the three similar tabs, followed by
a description of the <span class="GUI">Chirality</span> tab.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#feature2"><span class="GUI">Define Atoms For Adjustment</span> section</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature3">Parameter table</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature4"><span class="GUI">Delete</span>,
<span class="GUI">Delete All</span>, and <span class="GUI">Reset</span> buttons</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature5"><span class="GUI">Move</span> options</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature6"><span class="GUI">Chirality</span> tab</a></li>
</ul>

<a name="feature2"></a>
<h3>Define Atoms For Adjustment Section</h3>

<p>The three <a href="../misc/picking_controls.html">picking controls</a>,
<span class="GUI">Define Atoms For Distance Adjustment</span>,
<span class="GUI">Define Atoms For Angle Adjustment</span>, and
<span class="GUI">Define Atoms For Dihedral Adjustment</span>, are used to
define distances (two atoms), angles (three atoms), and dihedrals (four
atoms) to be adjusted. </p>

<p>You can choose <span class="GUI">Atoms</span> or <span
class="GUI">Bonds</span> from the <span class="GUI">Pick</span> option
menu. If you choose <span class="GUI">Atoms</span>, you must pick two
atoms for a distance adjustment, three for an angle adjustment, and four for a
dihedral 
adjustment. The last atom picked is the moving atom. If you choose
<span class="GUI">Bonds</span>, you must pick one bond for a distance adjustment,
two for an angle adjustment, and one for a dihedral adjustment. The bond for
dihedral adjustment is the bond between the second and third atoms. Maestro
chooses the remaining two atoms. The direction of the arrow for adjustment is
determined by where you click on the bond, for both dihedral and angle
adjustments. The moving atom is the atom closest to where you click.  For bond
angle adjustments, the moving atom is the atom in the second bond that is not
common to the two bonds.</p>

<p>In the dihedral panel, you can also click <span class="GUI">Dihedral</span> to
open the <a href="dihedral_selection.html"><span class="GUI">Dihedral
Selection</span></a> dialog box and select dihedrals by standard names.</p>

<a name="feature3"></a>
<h3>Parameter Table</h3>

<p>The table displays all the parameters that have been defined. For example in the
<span class="GUI">Distance</span> tab, the list shows all defined distances.
Click on a parameter to select it. If no parameters have been defined, you can
define one using the <a href="../misc/picking_controls.html">picking controls</a>
and selecting atoms or bonds in the Workspace.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Atom<i>n</i></span>&mdash;The atom columns identify the atoms
in each defined item, in the order of their selection.</p>
</li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Original</span>&mdash;Displays the value of the distance, angle or
dihedral at the time it was defined.</p>
</li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Current</span>&mdash;Displays the value of the distance, angle or
dihedral after adjustment. This field is directly editable. Valid ranges are:</p>

<ul></li>
<li><b>Distances:</b> 0.0 to infinity</li>
<li><b>Bond Angles:</b> 0.0 to +180 </li>
<li><b>Dihedral Angles:</b> -180 to +180 </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Name:</span> (for dihedrals only) Displays the name of the
dihedral if selected from the
<a href="dihedral_selection.html">Dihedral Selection</a> dialog box.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<a name="feature4"></a>
<h3>Delete, Delete All, and Reset Buttons</h3>

<p>Clicking <span class="GUI">Delete</span> while a parameter is selected
in the table deletes that particular parameter from the table and removes its
markers from the Workspace. Clicking <span class="GUI">Delete All</span>
clears the entire table, and removes all the corresponding markers from the
Workspace. To undo a delete, choose <span class="GUI">Undo delete</span>
from the <span class="GUI">Edit</span> menu in the main window, or press
<span class="GUI">Ctrl+Z</span> (<span class="Keys">&#x2318;Z</span>).</p>

<p>Clicking <span class="GUI">Reset</span> while a parameter is selected in the table
resets the distance, angle or dihedral to its original value.</p>

<a name="feature5"></a>
<h3>Move Options</h3>

<p>In this section you can determine how other atoms that are attached to the
moving atom are treated. The moving atom is the second atom for distance, third
atom for bond angle, and fourth atom for dihedral. There are three options:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Move All Attached Atoms</span>&mdash;(Default) All atoms
that are attached to the moving atom are moved together with the moving
atom. This is the most common action. However, this option is not available in
some cases that may cause problems:</p>
<ul></li>
<li>If two atoms, atom1 and atom2 (for distance) or atom2 and atom3 (for bond
angle and dihedral), are connected by a bond and in the same ring, this option
is not available.</li>
<li>If the two atoms are not connected by a bond, but still in the same ring,
the option is not available. </li>
<li>If the two atoms are not connected by a bond, but the second atom (atom2 for
distance, atom3 for bond angle and dihedral) is in a ring, this option might not
be available, depending on the structure.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Move All Attached Terminal Atoms</span>&mdash;Only atoms
that are terminally attached to the moving atom are moved together with the
moving atom. For example, hydrogen and halogen atoms would be moved, but a
methyl group would not.</p>
</li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Move Only Single Atom</span>&mdash;Only the moving atom
is moved, that is, atom2 (for distance), atom3 (for bond angle), or atom4 (for
dihedral). For dihedrals, the moving atom is not the same as in the other two
cases.</p></li>
</ul>

<a name="feature6"></a>
<h3>Chirality Tab</h3>

<p>In the <span class="GUI">Chirality</span> tab you can change the
chirality of chiral centers in the Workspace. The <span class="GUI">Invert
Chirality</span> picking controls allow you to change the chirality of a single
center, of all centers in a molecule, or all centers in an entry. When you
select <span class="GUI">Atoms</span> from the <span class="GUI">Pick</span>
menu, you must pick the chiral center first, then 
pick the two atoms that are to remain in place. After you have picked the third
atom, the two atoms that were not picked are interchanged, with their attached
groups.</p>

<p>If you want to label stereocenters with their chirality, click <span
class="GUI">Label Chiral Centers</span>. To clear these labels again, click
<span class="GUI"> Clear Labels</span>.
</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> You cannot change the chirality of a center at the junction of
two fused rings with these controls. To do so, you must perform the change
manually, using distance, angle and dihedral adjustments.</p>
