<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The <span class="GUI">Build</span> panel is used to create structures by
assembling them from fragments. A wide variety of fragments is provided.
The panel also contains controls for changing atom and residue properties.</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Build Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Build</span> panel, do one of the following:
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Edit &rarr; 
Build 
&rarr; Fragments</span>, <span
class="GUI">Atom Properties</span>, or <span class="GUI">Residue
Properties</span> in the main window. 
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Fragments</span>, <span class="GUI">Atom
Properties</span>, or <span class="GUI">Residue Properties</span> from the

</p>
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/build.png" />
</li>
</ul>

<a name="using"></a>
<h2>Using the Build Panel</h2>

<p>The <span class="GUI">Build</span> panel, combined with the <span
class="GUI">Build</span> and <span class="GUI">Fragments</span> toolbars,
provides tools for creating structures in the Workspace. You can build from
fragments in Place mode or Grow mode, you can draw structures free-hand, and you
can change residues in an existing structure in Mutate mode.  </p>

<a name="build3.1"></a>
<h3>Building in Place Mode</h3>

<p>Select <span class="GUI">Place</span> in the <span
class="GUI">Fragments</span> tab, select a fragment library from the <span
class="GUI">Fragments</span> menu, select a fragment, then click in the
Workspace to place the fragment. To add a fragment to this structure, select a
fragment, then click on the atom you want to replace with the fragment. You can
also select fragments from the <a
href="../tool_bar/toolbars.html#fragments"><span class="GUI">Fragments</span>
toolbar</a>.</p>

<a name="build3.2"></a>
<h3>Building in Grow Mode</h3>

<p>Select <span class="GUI">Grow</span> in the <span
class="GUI">Fragments</span> tab, select a fragment library from the <span
class="GUI">Fragments</span> menu, then select a fragment. The fragment is
automatically placed in the Workspace with a green arrow indicating the location
where the next fragment is to be added (the <i>grow bond</i>).  To add a
fragment to this structure, select a fragment. To change the grow bond, choose
<span class="GUI">Atom</span> or <span class="GUI">Bond</span> from the <span
class="GUI">Define grow bond</span> pick option menu, then select 2 atoms or 1
bond in the Workspace to define the bond. The grow direction is defined by the
second atom selected or the half-bond selected. </p>

<a name="build3.3"></a>
<h3>Drawing Structures</h3>

<p>To create a new structure by free-hand drawing, click the <span
class="GUI">Draw structures</span> button on the <a
href="../tool_bar/toolbars.html#build"><span class="GUI">Build</span>
toolbar</a> (pencil), choose an element from the button menu, then click in the
Workspace to place atoms. The atoms are connected by single bonds. The atom
enclosed in the purple cube is the <i>active</i> atom, to which the next atom
will be joined. To finish drawing, click on the active atom. The active atom
then becomes inactive. To select a new active atom, click on the active atom to
deactivate it, then click on the desired active atom. To create a bond from the
active atom to an existing atom, click on the existing atom. This atom becomes
the new active atom. If the existing atom is already bonded to the active atom,
the bond order is increased by one.</p>

<p>Once you have drawn a structure, you can move the atoms using the <span
class="GUI">Move</span> button on the <span class="GUI">Build</span>
toolbar. Choose a direction from the button menu and click on an atom to move
it. Moves in the Z direction take place automatically in 0.5&nbsp;&Aring;
increments. To move an atom in the XY plane, click the new location after
selecting the atom to move. </p>

<p>If you draw a bond between molecules that are in different entries, this
operation is considered to be a Connect operation. 
See the <a href="connect_fuse_panel.html"><span class="GUI">Connect &amp;
Fuse</span> panel</a> for more information.
</p>

<a name="build3.4"></a>
<h3>Mutating Residues</h3>

<p>To mutate residues in an existing structure, choose
<span class="GUI">Amino acids</span> from the
<span class="GUI">Fragments</span> menu in the
<span class="GUI">Fragments</span> tab. The
<span class="GUI">Mutate</span> option appears at the top of the tab.
Select this option, select an amino acid from the fragments list, then click
on the residue you want to mutate.</p>

<a name="features"></a>
<h2>Build Panel Features</h2>

<p>The <span class="GUI">Build</span> panel contains three tabs. The
<span class="GUI">Fragments</span> tab contains a range of fragment
types for building organic, inorganic, and biological molecules. The
<span class="GUI">Atom Properties</span> tab and the
<span class="GUI">Residue Properties</span> tab contain tools for
changing atom and residue properties.
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#feature2">Fragments Tab</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature3">Atom Properties Tab</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature4">Residue Properties Tab</a></li>
</ul>

<a name="feature2"></a>
<h3>Fragments Tab</h3>

<p>The <span class="GUI">Fragments</span> tab provides tools for
assembling structures from predefined fragments. There are two ways to assemble
a molecule using fragments: Place mode and Grow mode. These modes are described below.</p>

<p>The Fragments tab features are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#feature2.0"><span class="GUI">Place</span> option</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature2.1"><span class="GUI">Grow</span> option</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature2.2"><span class="GUI">Mutate</span> option</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature2.3"><span class="GUI">Fragments</span> option menu and
button array</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature2.4">Library-dependent option menus</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These features are described below.</p>

<dl>
<a name="feature2.0"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Place</span> option</dt>

<dd><p>In Place mode, you can select a fragment from the fragments section of the
tab and click in the Workspace to place the fragment. To join a fragment to
the structure in the Workspace, select a fragment and click on an atom in the
structure. The primary atom in the fragment replaces the atom on which you
click.  For example, the result of selecting methane, clicking once in the
Workspace to place the first fragment then clicking on a hydrogen atom in this
fragment is an ethane molecule.  As a second example, if you place cyclohexane,
select amine, and click on one of the carbon atoms in the ring, the result is
piperidine. Attaching fragments usually results in reasonable geometries, but
you might have to adjust the orientation. In Place mode, the <span
class="GUI">Grow direction</span> and <span class="GUI">Joining 
geometry</span> options are ignored.</p></dd>

<a name="feature2.1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Grow</span> option</dt>

<dd><p>In Grow mode, fragments are &quot;grown&quot; onto the existing structure
by replacing the atom (and any attachments) at the head of the <i>grow
bond</i>. The grow
bond is indicated by a green arrow.  Attachment of new fragments always takes
place in the direction of this green arrow. When you select a fragment in the
fragments section of the tab, it is automatically grown onto the structure,
and the grow bond is updated to a predefined location on the fragment just
grown. The geometry in which the fragment is joined can be controlled from
the <span class="GUI">Joining geometry</span> option menu.</p>

<p>If a grow bond is not defined, Maestro searches for a suitable grow bond. If
it cannot locate one, you must define one with the <span class="GUI">Define
grow bond</span> <a href="../misc/picking_controls.html">picking tools</a>.  You
can also define your own grow bond with these tools. If you pick two atoms, the
grow bond points to the second. If you pick a bond, the grow bond points to the
atom nearest to where you clicked. Grow bonds cannot be bonds that are part of a
ring. You can also reverse the direction of growth from the <span
class="GUI">Grow direction</span> option menu. If you reverse the direction,
Maestro defines a new grow bond at the opposite end of the molecule.</p>

<p>When growing a new structure, it is not necessary to first place a fragment.
The first fragment selected from the fragments section is placed in the
Workspace.</p></dd>


<a name="feature2.2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Mutate</span> option</dt>

<dd><p>When you select <span class="GUI">Amino acids</span> from the
<span class="GUI">Fragments</span> menu, a
<span class="GUI">Mutate</span> option is added to the tools at the top
of the tab. To mutate residues, select this option, click on an amino acid
in the fragments list, then click on the residue in the Workspace that you want
to mutate. The residue from the list replaces the residue in the structure.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature2.3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Fragments</span> option menu</dt>
<dd><p>The <span class="GUI">Fragments</span> option menu provides access

<h3>Atom Properties tab</h3>

<p>The tools in the <span class="GUI">Atom Properties</span> tab allow
you to change properties of the atoms in the Workspace. To see the values of the
properties in the Workspace, you must include the properties in the atom label
and label the atoms. 
The <span class="GUI">Properties</span> menu lists specific properties that can
be changed, and provides a general editing mechanism for any atom property. Each
choice displays a set of tools in the lower part of the tab. The choices are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#feature3.1"><span class="GUI">Elements</span></a></li>
<li><a href="#feature3.2"><span class="GUI">Atom Type (MacroModel)</span></a></li>

<dt><span class="GUI">Partial Charge</span></dt>
<dd><p>When you choose <span class="GUI">Partial charge</span> from the <span
class="GUI">Properties</span> menu, you can set both the partial charge and
the solvation charge. The partial atomic charge is used in the electrostatic
part of molecular mechanics calculations, and the solvation charge is used by
MacroModel in GB/SA solvation calculations. In most circumstances, these should
be the same value. To set the charges, enter values in the text boxes, then
use the <a href="../misc/picking_controls.html">picking tools</a> to select
the atoms whose charge is to be set. </p></dd>

<a name="feature3.4"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">PDB Atom Name</span></dt>
<dd><p>When you choose <span class="GUI">PDB Atom Name</span> from the <span class="GUI">Properties</span> menu, you can use the tools that are displayed
to set PDB atom names and assign unique PDB atom names within residues.
Only the first four characters of the atom name are used when you set the name.
To set the name, enter a name in the <span class="GUI">PDB atom name</span>
text box, then use the <a href="../misc/picking_controls.html">picking
tools</a> to select the atoms to name.</p> 

<p>According to the PDB standard, the first two characters should contain the
element symbol, right-justified; the third character is a remoteness
indicator (A=alpha, B=beta, G=gamma, etc.), and the fourth is a numeric
branch designator, if applicable.  So, a generic carbon atom should be
<tt>_C__</tt> with the <tt>_</tt> characters indicating spaces.  A peptide
alpha carbon should be <tt>_CA_</tt>, and not <tt>CA__</tt> which is
interpreted as a calcium atom.</p>

<p>To apply unique PDB atom names within selected residues, use
the <span class="GUI">Set unique PDB atom names within residues</span> 
<a href="../misc/picking_controls.html">picking tools</a> to select the residues
to rename. The unique names are composed of the element symbol, right justified
in the first two characters, followed by a numeric index for that element. The
names are only unique within each residue. </p></dd>

<a name="feature3.5"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Grow Name</span></dt>

<dd><p>When you choose <span class="GUI">Atom Name</span> from the <span class="GUI">Properties</span> menu, you can use the tools that are displayed
to set atom names, to define and assign canonical names, and to assign unique
atom names. To apply a specific name to selected atoms, enter the name in the
<span class="GUI">Atom name</span> text box, then use the
<a href="../misc/picking_controls.html">picking tools</a> to
select the atoms to which you want to apply the name. Because the "~"
character is used to make unique names, this character cannot be specified in
user-assigned names.  To assign canonical
names, choose a composition from the <span class="GUI">Composition</span>
menu, enter a separator of up to 4 characters in the <span class="GUI">Separator</span>
text box (if you want to change it from the default of a space), then click
<span class="GUI">Apply To All Atoms</span>. To make existing names unique,
click <span class="GUI">Make Unique</span>. If
an atom has no name, the default canonical name consisting of element and atom
number is used; if two or more atoms have the same name, a numeric suffix
followed by a tilde '~' character is used to distinguish them from each other. 
</p></dd>

<a name="feature3.7"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Other</span></dt>
<dd><p>When you choose <span class="GUI">Other</span>, the tools that are
displayed allow you to change the properties for any of the properties that do
not have special editing tools. To edit one or more properties, select them in
the <span class="GUI">Properties</span> list. These properties are added as
columns to the <span class="GUI">Atoms</span> table. Next, use
the <span class="GUI">Add atoms to edit their properties</span> 
<a href="../misc/picking_controls.html">picking tools</a> to
select the atoms that you want to edit. The
atoms are listed in the <span class="GUI">Atoms</span> table by atom number, and
the property columns are populated with the values. To change a property for an
atom, you can edit the table cell. To set the value for multiple atoms, select
the atom rows in the table, edit one of the table cells, and press <span
class="Keys">Ctrl+ENTER</span> (<span class="Keys">&#x2318;ENTER</span>) to apply the change to the selected rows.
Selecting atoms in the table also selects them in the Workspace. 
</p>
<p>If you want to delete property values for all atoms in the Workspace, choose
the properties from the <span class="GUI">Property</span> list and click <span
class="GUI">Delete</span>. The property values are removed from all atoms in the
Workspace (not just those in the table), and the property is removed from
the <span class="GUI">Atoms</span> table.
</p>
<p>If you want to add a property to the atoms that are selected in the <span
class="GUI">Atoms</span> table, click <span class="GUI">Add</span>. The <span
class="GUI">Add Property</span> dialog box opens, in which you can select the

option menu. Each property choice displays a set of tools in the lower part of the
tab. The available properties are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#feature4.1"><span class="GUI">Residue Number</span></a></li>
<li><a href="#feature4.2"><span class="GUI">Residue Name</span></a></li>

<dt><span class="GUI">Residue Number</span></dt>
<dd><p>When you choose <span class="GUI">Residue Number</span> from the <span class="GUI">Properties</span> menu, you can use the tools that are displayed
to set the residue number for selected residues, and renumber residues within a
structure.</p>
<p>To set the residue number, enter the number in the
<span class="GUI">Residue number</span> text box, and select the residue to
apply the number to, or click the common objects button and choose
<span class="GUI">Select</span> to open
the <a href="../misc/asd.html"><span class="GUI">Atom Selection</span>
dialog box</a> and define the residues whose number is to be set. If the residue
number is incorrect for one or more atoms, you can pick atoms rather than
residues to apply the residue number to. </p>

<p>To renumber residues, by incrementing the residue number, enter a starting
number in the <span class="GUI">Renumber from</span> text box, choose a
structural unit from the <span class="GUI">Pick</span> menu and select the units
to renumber, or use the common objects button to select predefined atom sets or
atom selections, or open the <a href="../misc/asd.html"><span class="GUI">Atom
Selection</span> dialog box</a> to define the residues to renumber.  The residue
with the lowest number in the selection is assigned the number in the text
box. The residue numbers for the remaining residues are shifted by the same
amount as that of the residue with the lowest number. Renumbering therefore
preserves gaps in the residue numbering. If you want to eliminate gaps, select
the residues above the gap and renumber them.
