<p>Maestro provides a number of tools for adjusting structures, that is, for
moving atoms within a structure. General-purpose adjustments &mdash;translation
of a group of atoms or rotation of a group of atoms with respect to a
user-defined center&mdash; can be done with local transformations, which are
described in the <a href="local_transformations.html">Local Transformations</a>
topic. These adjustments take no account of the bonding between atoms. The tools
available from the <span class="GUI">Adjust</span> button menu on the
<a href="toolbars.html#edit"><span class="GUI">Edit</span> toolbar</a>,</p> 
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/adjust.png">
<p>allow you to adjust structures by changing bond lengths, bond angles,
dihedral angles, and chiralities; by changing the conformation around peptides,
and by selecting from a set of amino acid side-chain rotamers.
</p>

<p>Adjustments are made by dragging with the left mouse button or using the
scroll wheel. Dragging generally gives finer increments than the scroll
wheel. You can use the middle and right mouse buttons to perform global 
rotations and translations as usual while you are doing adjustments.</p>

<p>The five groups of tools on this button menu are described below.
</p>

<h3>Quick Torsion tools</h3>
<p>These tools allow you to quickly select a bond around which to perform a
rotation, and view contacts and H-bonds with other atoms while you rotate.
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Quick Torsion</span>&mdash;Adjust a dihedral angle. 
When you choose this item, you can pick a bond (&quot;B&quot; picking cursor)
in the Workspace, then drag horizontally or use the scroll
wheel to change the dihedral angles around the bond. An arrow on the bond points
to the fragment that is moved; to change the direction, click the bond again.
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Display H-bonds</span>&mdash;Display hydrogen bonds
while rotating around the bond. 
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Display Contacts</span>&mdash;Display bad and ugly
contacts while rotating around the bond.</li>
</ul>
<p>The two display options are saved as preferences and are applied whenever you
use <span class="GUI">Quick Torsion</span>.
</p>

<h3>Peptide linkage tools</h3>
<p>The tools in this group allow you to quickly rearrange the orientation of the
atoms in a peptide linkage, keeping the rest of the structure the same.
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Rotate Peptide Plane</span>&mdash;Rotate the plane of
the peptide linkage. To select the peptide linkage, pick one of its atoms. The
axis of rotation is the line between the alpha carbons on either side of the
peptide linkage, and is marked with a semitransparent rectangular plane when
you pick an atom in the linkage.  
To rotate the plane, drag horizontally or use the scroll wheel. 
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Rotate Carbonyl Plane</span>&mdash;Rotate the plane of
the carbonyl in a peptide linkage. To select the peptide linkage, pick one of
its atoms. The axis of rotation is the line between the alpha carbons on one
side of the carbonyl and the amide nitrogen on the other, and is marked
 with a semitransparent rectangular plane when you pick an atom in the linkage. 
To rotate the plane, drag horizontally or use the scroll wheel. 
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Convert Cis/Trans</span>&mdash;Convert a peptide
linkage from cis to trans or trans to cis. To convert the linkage, pick one of
its atoms. The conversion keeps the rest of the structure intact, and tries to
provide a reasonable placement of the atoms of the linkage. The plane of the
linkage is maintained. The conversion is likely to produce strained geometries,
so some kind of adjustment or minimization of the structure following the
conversion is desirable.
</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Geometric adjustment tools</h3>
<p>These tools allow you to pick distances, angles, dihedrals, or chiral atoms
for adjustment. These adjustment tools are also available in the 
<span class="GUI">Adjust</span> panel, which you open from the 
<span class="GUI">Edit</span> menu.
</p>
<p>The distance, angle, and dihedral adjustments function in a similar way. When
you have selected Distance, Angle, or Dihedral from the button menu, you then
pick two, three, or four atoms in the Workspace. Each atom is marked with a
purple cube, until you pick the last atom. On the final pick, the cubes are
replaced with adjustment markers. 
</p>
<p>You do not have to pick atoms that are bonded to each other. If the last two
atoms that you pick are not bonded to each other, only the last atom is
moved. If they are bonded, the last atom is moved with all its attachments. 
</p>
<p>To adjust the geometric parameter, drag horizontally or use the scroll
wheel. 
</p>
<p>Chirality adjustments also require picking. When you have chosen 
<span class="GUI">Chirality</span> from the button menu, pick the chiral atom,
then the two atoms that are attached to it that will remain in place. The other
two atoms with their attachments are swapped when you make the third pick. If
you need to see which atoms are chiral, you can choose 
<span class="GUI">Chirality</span> from the <span class="GUI">Label All</span>
button menu on the <a href="toolbars.html#labels"><span
class="GUI">Labels</span> toolbar</a>.
</p>

<h3>Adjustment deletion</h3>
<p>The <span class="GUI">Delete Adjustments</span> item deletes the information
about adjustments and removes the markers from the Workspace. It does not affect
the adjustments made to the structure. The markers remain in the Workspace while
you are doing adjustments; they are hidden if you move to some other task, but
are redisplayed if you return to adjustments. 
</p>

<h3>Rotamer selection tool</h3>
<p>This tool allows you to select an amino-acid side-chain rotamer from a
standard set of rotamers. To use this tool, first select the desired residues in
the Workspace, then choose <span class="GUI">Rotamers</span> from the button
menu. The selection of the side chain rotamer is done in the 
<a href="../edit_menu/rotamers_db.html"><span class="GUI">Rotamers</span> dialog
box</a>. You can also open this dialog box from the 
<span class="GUI">Adjust</span> submenu of the <span class="GUI">Edit</span>
menu.
