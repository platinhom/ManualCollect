<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>In this dialog box you can create, edit and delete custom property families.
Property families are also created by applications; these families cannot be
changed.
</p>

<a name="section2"></a>
<h2>Opening the Manage Custom Property Families Dialog Box</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Manage Custom Property Families</span> 
dialog box:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Choose <span class="GUI">Property &gt; </span>
<span class="GUI">Custom Families</span> in the <span class="GUI">Project Table</span> panel.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<a name="section3"></a> 
<h2>Using the Manage Custom Property Families Dialog Box</h2> 

<p>Some procedures are given below for creating and editing custom property
families. Changes that you make to a property family are applied immediately:
there is no confirmation for changes to the properties included, or for deleting
a family. You should therefore take care to make a copy of any family that you
do not want to change or delete accidentally. 
</p>

<p>The primary property families for each application are custom families, which
you can change if you want. To restore the default definitions of these
families, click <span class="GUI">Reset Primary Families</span>. You can change
the primary property families from the Tree view of the properties by dragging
properties between the primary and secondary sets. To open the Tree view, choose
<span class="GUI">Properties &rarr; Tree</span> or click the <span
class="GUI">Tree</span> toolbar button.
</p>

<p>Property family definitions are stored in the file
<code>custom_property_groups</code> in your user resources directory 
(<code>$HOME/.schrodinger/maestro</code><i>NN</i> on Linux or Mac, 
(<code>%APPDATA%\Schrodinger\maestro</code><i>NN</i> on Windows). Thus, they are
not tied to a particular project, but are part of your Maestro customization. 
</p>
