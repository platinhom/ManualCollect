<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
In this step, the docking results are reduced to a small combinatorial library
that contains the highest-scoring compounds. The reduction is achieved by
filtering on various properties and by selection, and the final library is
written out.
</p>

<a name="working"></a>
<h2>Working in the Analyze Library Step</h2>

<p>
The goal of this step is to select a small set of reagents that is then used
to create a combinatorial library, by applying various selection
strategies, filtering, and manual selection. The purpose of this selection step
is to create reagent lists that are small enough and well enough chosen for
practical synthesis and screening of the resulting real combinatorial
library.</p>

<p>Selection and filtering is done in the <span class="GUI">Filter and Select</span> dialog
box, which you open by clicking <span class="GUI">Filter and Select</span>.
The selection strategies and
the filters are described below. When you click <span class="GUI">OK</span>
or <span class="GUI">Apply</span> in this dialog box, a job is run to
perform the filtering and selection. At the end of the job,
the tables are filled and you can examine the results. You can
repeat the selection and filtering as many times as you like, save the results
in the run, restore results from a previous selection, and compare results for
different selections. When you are satisfied with a library, you can run a job
to create and store the structures in the library, by clicking <span class="GUI">Create Library</span>.


<h3>Selection Strategies</h3>

<p>CombiGlide has three automated selection strategies, which can be supplemented
with manual selection. The automated strategies use the GlideScore to select the
reagents that produce the greatest number of structures that have a good
GlideScore, and are therefore likely to be active. </p>

<p>The selection strategies work by filling lists of reagents at each position,
until the limits on the minimum and maximum number of reagents and the overall
library size are met. The molecules from the docking step are ordered according
to their GlideScore or some derived quantity. Each molecule is considered in
turn, and the reagents that were used at each position to build that molecule
are added to the corresponding lists.</p>

<p>The first strategy selects reagents based on the single side-chain docking.
In this strategy, the lists for each position can be filled independently from
the docking results for each position.
</p>

<p>The second strategy selects reagents based on the GlideScores from the
combinatorial docking. In this strategy, reagents for each position are added
from each molecule, unless they have already been added. As lists are
filled, the remaining lists can be filled using molecules with reagents that
are in the filled list, or using any molecule, regardless of whether the reagents
are in the filled list. The first option ensures that all molecules used to
create the library are in the library. This strategy ensures that the molecules
in the library contain those with the best GlideScores. </p>

<p>The third strategy uses the GlideScore from the combinatorial docking as a
free energy, and calculates the normalized Boltzmann population for each docked
molecule. The populations are summed for each reagent, and reagents are added to
the lists in order of population, from highest to lowest. This strategy samples
the most frequently occurring reagents, weighted according to GlideScore:
reagents coming from molecules with good GlideScores are weighted more heavily
than those with poor GlideScores. </p>

<p>Finally, you can manually select reagents that must be included in the
library or that must be excluded from the library, in the <span class="GUI">Include/Exclude</span> tab of the <span class="GUI">Filter and Select</span> dialog box. In addition, you can
set the minimum and maximum number of reagents at each position, and set an
overall library size, in the <span class="GUI">Selection
Strategy</span> tab of the <span class="GUI">Filter and
Select</span> dialog box. </p>

<h3>Filtering</h3>

<p>In addition to selecting reagents based on the GlideScore of the molecules
that they are used to build, you can filter the combinatorial results based on
various properties of druglike molecules. These properties are mostly generated
by QikProp. Several filters are provided, and you can customize these filters by
including or excluding any of the listed properties and by setting the limits on
the acceptable range of properties. The filters are set up in the <span class="GUI">Filter</span> tab of the <span class="GUI">Filter and Select</span> dialog box.  </p>

<p>Filtering is not available unless you have a QikProp license.</p>

<h3>Library Size Status Area</h3>
<p>Displays the size of the combinatorial library, both in terms of the

<h3>Create Library Button</h3>
<p>Run the job to create the library (structures) based on the current library
definition. The library is a Maestro file that contains all the structures
generated from the reagent variants that score better than the cutoff. In

definition. This is the same file as is written with the
<span class="GUI">Write Text File</span> button.
