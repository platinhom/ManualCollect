<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The <span class="GUI">Ring Closures</span> panel allows ring-opening
locations for MCMM and SPMC calculations to be specified.</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Ring Closures Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Ring Closures</span> panel:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In the  <span class="GUI">CSearch</span> tab of the 
<a href="conformational_search.html"><span class="GUI">Conformational
Search</span></a> panel, choose <span class="GUI">Ring Closures</span> from the
<span class="GUI">Search variables</span> option menu, then click 
<span class="GUI">Edit</span>.
</p></li>
</ul>

<a name="using"></a>
<h2>Using the Ring Closures Panel</h2>

<p>During a Monte Carlo-based conformational search (MCMM or SPMC) it is
necessary to break rings open before varying their torsions. Then after
random torsion variations have been evaluated, the ring must be re-closed.
The appropriate location for ring closures needs to be defined before
a calculation can be started. "Ring Closures" consist of four atoms that
define the bond to be broken (and then re-closed) during a MCMM or
SPMC step.</p>

<p>The simplest way to create ring closures is to click the <span
class="GUI">Perform Automatic Setup</span> button in the <span
class="GUI">Conformational Search</span> panel. MacroModel makes
reasonable decisions about where a ring should be opened. </p>

<dt>List of ring closures</dt>
<dd><p>This list shows the sets of four atoms that define the ring closures to
use in the calculations. You can select a line in the list to display or
delete.</p>
<p>If you clicked <span class="GUI">Perform Automatic Setup</span> in the 
<span class="GUI">Conformational Search</span> panel, this list contains the
results of the setup when you open the panel.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Minimum distance</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>The minimum acceptable distance between the second and third ring
closure atoms must be specified. If the distance between the ring closure atoms
is less than this minimum distance, then the ring is reopened and a different
set of random variations is performed. The default value for this is
0.5&nbsp;&Aring;, and this value should suffice for most searches. </p></dd>

<a name="feature4"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Maximum distance</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>This text box allows a value to be specified for the
maximum acceptable distance between the second and third atoms of a
re-closed ring. If the distance between the ring closure atoms is greater
than this maximum distance, the ring is reopened and a different set of
random variations is performed. The default value for this is 2.5&nbsp;&Aring;,
and this value should suffice for most searches. </p></dd>

<a name="feature2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Define ring closures</span> section</dt>
<dd><p>To manually define the location of a ring opening, define the ring
closure by picking four atoms with the standard
<a href="../misc/picking_controls.html">picking controls</a> in this
section. The actual bond breakage occurs between the second and third picked
atoms. The first and fourth atoms should also be in the ring. As the first three
atoms are picked, a purple box is placed around them. Once the fourth
atom is picked, a new entry is displayed in the list.</p>
<p>A ring closure can be redefined by picking new atoms while the closure is
selected in the list.</p></dd> 

<a name="feature5"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Markers</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>If this option is selected, the four selected atoms are marked with a
light green line. The line is solid between the first and second atoms and the
third and fourth atoms. To indicate where the ring closure will occur, Maestro
places a broken line and a lightning bolt between the second and third atoms. To 
distinguish the currently selected closure,  a solid line is placed on either
side of the broken one.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature6"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Delete</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>To delete a defined ring closure, select it by clicking on it in the
list, or re-pick the atoms that define it, then click <span
class="GUI">Delete</span>. </p></dd>

<a name="feature7"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Delete All</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>To delete all the defined ring closures, click this button.
