<h2>Summary</h2>
The "Stretch" panel is used to display all the stretching interactions for a
given calculation. <p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Stretch Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Stretch</span> panel,
click the <span class="GUI">Stretch</span> button in the
<a href="../tools_menu/ffview_panel.html">Force Field Viewer Panel</a>. </p>

<a name="using"></a>
<h2>Using the Stretch Panel</h2>
The Stretch Interaction List on the left side of the "Stretch" panel displays all the stretching
interactions present the selected .mmo file, in the order they were read from
the file. To select a particular stretch, highlight click on it with the left
mouse button, or pick the atoms defining the stretched bond from the Workspace
structure. The text boxes on the panel will update to display data
relevant to the selected stretch. <p>

<a name="feature1"></a>
<dt>Stretch Interaction List:</dt>
<dd><p>All the stretching interactions in a given .mmo file are displayed in
the
Stretch Interaction List located on the left side of the "Stretch" panel.
The text box in which the list appears is a read-only field. </p></dd>

<a name="feature2"></a>
<dt>Find by Picking:</dt>
<dd><p>To locate a particular interaction in the list, enable the "Find by
Picking" toggle button and click on the two atoms in the structure that
define the stretch. Once the second atom has been picked (and assuming the
stretch can be found), the interaction corresponding to those two atoms
will be selected in the list. </p></dd>

<a name="feature3"></a>
<dt>Sort by Energy:</dt>
<dd><p>By default, the stretching interactions that are displayed in the list
appear in the order in which they were read from the .mmo file. However,
the list may be sorted according to energy by enabling the "Sort By
Energy" toggle button. The interaction with the lowest (i.e. most
negative) energy will then be displayed at the beginning of the list and the
interaction with the highest energy (i.e. most positive) will be displayed
at the end. </p></dd>

<a name="feature4"></a>
<dt>Show:</dt>
<dd><p>When Maestro first reads an .mmo file, all of the stretching
interactions
are displayed on the "Stretch" panel. To limit the displayed stretches
based on quality, select the "High Quality," "Medium Quality," or "Low
Quality" option from the "Show:" menu. Limiting the display to only the
low quality parameters is a useful way to identify those that might be
generalized or that might not be suitable for calculations in which a
high degree of accuracy is desired. Clicking on the "All Parameters"
option redisplays all "Stretch" interactions. </p></dd>

<a name="feature5"></a>
<dt>Show Force Field:</dt>
<dd><p>Clicking on the "Show Force Field" button opens the "FField" panel,
which displays the selected.mmo file in its entirety. When the panel is
opened, a text line will be selected. This line corresponds to the
stretch that is currently selected in the Stretch Interaction List.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature6"></a>
<dt>Stretch Energy:</dt>
<dd><p>The "Stretch Energy:" text field contains the value of the
contribution to
the total molecular mechanics energy that arises from the currently
selected stretch. This value can be thought of as the energy penalty for
deviating from the ideal bond length. </p></dd>

<a name="feature7"></a>
<dt>Force Constant:</dt>
<dd><p>This value is the standard force constant for the currently selected
stretch. More specifically, it is how rapidly the forces holding the
currently selected atoms in place change with respect to displacement from
the ideal bond length. This value is different for each type of bend
interaction. </p></dd>

<a name="feature8"></a>
<dt>Ideal Length:</dt>
<dd><p>An ideal length is that which, for the specified geometry, makes the
least possible contribution to the total molecular mechanics energy.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature9"></a>
<dt>Origin:</dt>
<dd><p>The "Origin:" setting is meant to provide users with information
regarding
the actual parameter evaluation method used in the present calculation.
The possible entries in this field include "Original," "Modified
Parameter," and "Additional Parameter." "Original" means that the force
field used was in its native state, as published by the original author.
"Modified" implies that MacroModel used a version with parameters that have
been revised based on work by the MacroModel research group or subsequent
publications. Finally, the "Additional Parameter" message indicates that
MacroModel's force field treatment of this particular item involves at least
one parameter that was absent from the native force field. For more
information about which parameters have been modified or added, see the
help topic on the specific field in the list of related topics below.
Also, the source of the modifications/additions is listed on the first
line of each .mmo file. </p></dd>

<a name="feature10"></a>
<dt>Alternate:</dt>
<dd><p>For some force fields, it is possible to modify particular parameters.
For
instance, in the AMBER* field, either the Senderowitz-Parish-Still or the
Homans carbohydrate parameters can be chosen. To select an alternate
treatment, you must edit the force field file. The "Alternate:" text field
in the "Force Field Viewer" panels is meant only to notify you which, if
any, modifications were made to the force field before the calculation in
the currently selected file was performed. </p></dd>

<a name="feature11"></a>
<dt>Comment:</dt>
<dd><p>The text in this field is a description of the atom and bond
configuration
for the currently selected stretch interaction. </p></dd>

<a name="feature12"></a>
<dt>Str-Bend Energy:</dt>
<dd><p>Each time a bond angle is changed, the bond character of the affected
atoms is also changed. The energy penalty associated with this bond length
revision is displayed in the "Str-Bend Energy:" text field. Note that this
value is only considered for force fields that produce extremely accurate
bond characteristics (MM2* and MMFF). </p></dd>

<a name="feature13"></a>
<dt>Actual Length:</dt>
<dd><p>The value displayed in the "Actual Length:" text box describes the new
stretch (defined by the atoms whose numbers appear in the Stretch
Interaction List entry) produced by the energy operation for which the
currently displayed file was written. Compare this value with the number
displayed in the "Ideal Length:" box. </p></dd>

<a name="feature14"></a>
<dt>Quality:</dt>
<dd><p>The designation that appears in this field refers to the confidence
level
for the currently selected measurement. Calculations using the original
force field parameters, or parameters that have otherwise been extensively
researched, are given "High Quality" ratings. Calculations that include
less certain parameters are given "Medium Quality" ratings. Calculations
using parameters that are applied generically, without consideration for
a particular bonding situation, are given "Low Quality" designations.
Those parameters that are given "Low Quality" ratings may not be
acceptable in calculations that require high accuracy. <p>

The "Quality" rating system is meant to be used only as a guide. Ratings
are somewhat relative. For instance, a parameter designated as "medium"
quality for a high-accuracy force field like MMFF might still produce more
reliable results than a "high" quality parameter in the MM2* field. Please
note that it is still possible to obtain inaccurate results from a
parameter with a "High Quality" rating. </p></dd>
