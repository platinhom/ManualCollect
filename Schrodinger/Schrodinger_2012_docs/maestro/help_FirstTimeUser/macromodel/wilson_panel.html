<h2>Summary</h2>
The <span class="GUI">Wilson Angle</span> panel is used to display all
the Wilson angles for a given calculation. <p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Wilson Angle Panel</h2>
<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Wilson Angle</span> panel:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Click the <span class="GUI">Wilson Angle</span> button in the
<span class="GUI">Force Field Viewer</span> panel.</p></li>
</ul>

<a name="using"></a>
<h2>Using the Wilson Angle Panel</h2>
The Wilson Angle List on the left side of the <span class="GUI">Wilson Angle</span>
panel displays all
the Wilson angles present the selected .mmo file, in the order they were read
from the file. To select a particular angle, highlight it in the list by
clicking on it with the left mouse button, or pick the atoms from the Workspace
structure. The text boxes on the panel will update to display data relevant
to the selected angle. <p>

<a name="feature1"></a>
<dt>Wilson Angle List:</dt>
<dd><p>All the Wilson angles in a given .mmo file are displayed in the Wilson
Angles List located on the left side of the "Wilson Angle" panel. The
text box in which the list appears is a read-only field. </p></dd>

<a name="feature2"></a>
<dt>Find by Picking:</dt>
<dd><p>To locate a particular angle in the list, enable the "Find by Picking"
toggle button and click on the four atoms in the structure that define the
angle. Once the fourth atom has been picked (and assuming an entry for the
atoms can be found), the angle corresponding to those four atoms will be
selected in the list. </p></dd>

<a name="feature3"></a>
<dt>Sort by Energy:</dt>
<dd><p>By default, the Wilson angles that are displayed on the list appear in
the
order in which they were read from the .mmo file. However, the list may be
sorted according to energy by enabling the "Sort By Energy" toggle button.
The angle with the lowest (i.e. most negative) energy will then be
displayed at the beginning of the list and the one with the highest energy (i.e.
most positive) will be displayed at the end. </p></dd>

<a name="feature4"></a>
<dt>Show:</dt>
<dd><p>When Maestro first reads an .mmo file, all of the Wilson angles are
displayed on the "Wilson Angle" panel. To limit the displayed angles
based on quality, select the "High Quality," "Medium Quality," or "Low
Quality" menu option from the "Show:" menu. Limiting the display to only
the low quality parameters is a useful way to identify those that might
be generalized or that might not suitable for calculations in which a
high degree of accuracy is desired. Clicking on the "All Parameters"
option redisplays all angles. </p></dd>

<a name="feature5"></a>
<dt>Show Force Field:</dt>
<dd><p>Clicking on the "Show Force Field" button opens the "FField" panel,
which displays the selected .mmo file in its entirety. When the panel is
opened, a text line will be selected. This line corresponds to the
angle that is currently selected in the Wilson Angles List. </p></dd>

<a name="feature6"></a>
<dt>Wilson Energy:</dt>
<dd><p>Wilson angles, like improper torsions, are defined by four atoms, of
which
only three are bound sequentially. Take, for example, a T-shaped molecule
defined by three atoms in sequence and a fourth atom that is attached to
only the second. The molecular geometry around the second atom, as viewed
down the 4-2 bond (e.g. planar or bent) would fall under the category of a
Wilson angle. The value that appears in the "Wilson Energy:" text box, is
the contribution to the total molecular mechanics energy arising from the
selected angle. Note that Wilson angles are only used in the MMFF and
MMFFs force fields. All other fields use improper torsions. </p></dd>

<a name="feature7"></a>
<dt>Angle:</dt>
<dd><p>There is no "ideal" Wilson angle. The number displayed in this field
corresponds to the energy shown in the "Wilson Energy:" text box. </p></dd>

<a name="feature8"></a>
<dt>Origin:</dt>
<dd><p>The "Origin:" setting is meant to provide users with information
regarding
the actual parameter evaluation method used in the present calculation.
The possible entries in this field include "Original," "Modified
Parameter," and "Additional Parameter." "Original" means that the force
field used was in its native state, as published by the original author.
"Modified" implies that MacroModel used a version with parameters that have
been revised based on work by the MacroModel research group or subsequent
publications. Finally, the "Additional Parameter" message indicates that
MacroModel's force field treatment of this particular item involves at least
one parameter that was absent from the native force field. For more
information about which parameters have been modified or added, see the
help topic on the specific field in the list of related topics below.
Also, the source of the modifications/additions is listed on the first
line of each .mmo file. </p></dd>

<a name="feature9"></a>
<dt>Alternate:</dt>
<dd><p>For some force fields, it is possible for users to customize
particular
parameters. For instance, in the AMBER* field, either the
Senderowitz-Parish-Still or the Homans carbohydrate parameters can be
chosen. To select a treatment different than the default, you must edit
the force field file. The "Alternate:" text field in the "Force Field
Viewer" panels is meant only to notify you which, if any, modifications
were made to the force field before the calculation in the currently
selected file was performed. </p></dd>

<a name="feature10"></a>
<dt>Comment:</dt>
<dd><p>The text in this field is a description of the atom and bond
configuration
of the currently selected angle. </p></dd>

<a name="feature11"></a>
<dt>Force Constant:</dt>
<dd><p>This value is the standard force constant for the currently selected
angle. More specifically, it is how rapidly the forces holding the current
angle in place change with respect to displacement from that angle. The
constant takes on different values depending on the atom types and bonding
arrangements. </p></dd>

<a name="feature12"></a>
<dt>Quality:</dt>
<dd><p>The designation that appears in this field refers to the confidence
level
for the currently selected measurement. Calculations using the original
force field parameters, or parameters that have otherwise been extensively
researched, are given "High Quality" ratings. Calculations that include
less certain parameters are given "Medium Quality" ratings. Calculations
using parameters that are applied generically, without consideration for
a particular bonding situation, are given "Low Quality" designations.
Those parameters that are given "Low Quality" ratings may not be
acceptable in calculations that require high accuracy. <p>

The "Quality" rating system is meant to be used only as a guide. Ratings
are somewhat relative. For instance, a parameter designated as "medium"
quality for a high-accuracy force field like MMFF might still produce more
reliable results than a "high" quality parameter in the MM2* field. Please
note that it is still possible to obtain inaccurate results from a
parameter with a "High Quality" rating. </p></dd>
