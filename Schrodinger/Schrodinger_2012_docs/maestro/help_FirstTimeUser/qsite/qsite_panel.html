<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>QSite performs mixed quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM)
calculations, using Jaguar for the QM calculations and Impact for the MM
calculations.  Ligands and other specified regions of a protein complex can be
studied using QM while MM is used for the rest of the complex.</p>

<p>At each step of a QM geometry optimization, Impact calculates energy terms
for MM-QM region interactions; if MM minimization was also specified, it is
also performed at each QM step. The next QM step takes into account
the new MM atom distribution and energy terms. If a single-point QM
calculation is selected, the current QM/MM energy is calculated
without MM minimization.</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the QSite Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">QSite</span> panel:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Applications &rarr; QSite</span>.</p></li>
</ul>

<a name="using"></a>
<h2>Using the QSite Panel</h2>

<p>A QSite calculation can only be performed using a single entry.  If the
ligand and receptor are separate entries in the Project Table, they should be
combined into a single entry using the
<a href="../pt_entry_menu/entry_combine.html"><span class="GUI">Merge</span>
option</a> from the <span class="GUI">Entry</span> menu in the <span
class="GUI">Project Table</span> panel.  The merged entry should be the only
entry included in the Workspace or selected in the Project Table when you start
the job.</p>

<p>One exception to this is when setting up a transition-state search. In this
case you may select up to three Project Table entries, depending upon the
algorithm that is chosen for performing the search. Transition-state searches
are described in the <a href="qm_optimization_tab.html"><span
class="GUI">Optimization</span> tab</a> topic.</p>

<p>When you have set the options in the <span class="GUI">QSite</span> panel
tabs to the desired value, click <span class="GUI">Start</span>.  The
<span class="GUI">QSite - Start</span> dialog box opens, and you can make
settings for incorporation of results, job name, and user name, and select the host
to run the job.  The default job name is <tt>qsite</tt>.  See the <a
href="../misc/job_start_db.html">Start Dialog Box</a> topic for
descriptions of these options.</p>

<p>The <span class="GUI">QSite - Start</span> dialog box also includes a <span
class="GUI">CPUs</span> text box.  The QM (Jaguar) portion of the QSite job can
be run in parallel if multiple processors are available. Specify the number of
processors that will be used for the QM calculation in this text box.</p>

<p>When you have selected job options, click <span class="GUI">Start</span> to
run the job. The <span class="GUI">Monitor</span> panel opens, in which you can
monitor the progress of the job. </p>

<p>If a QSite job needs to be restarted, you can read the restart file using the
<span class="GUI">Read</span> button. The controls in the <span
class="GUI">QSite</span> panel are set from the information in the restart file,
and you can simply resubmit the job. </p>

<p>The speed of QSite is largely determined by the size of the QM
region. Therefore there is no advantage to making a smaller model protein. QSite
automatically selects the Impact executable for the size of the protein.</p>

<p>See the <a href="../../../qsite/qsite_user_manual.pdf"
target="pdfmanuals"><i>QSite User Manual</i></a> for more information.</p>

<h2>Rules and Procedures for Creating the QM/MM Boundary</h2>

<p>There are three general ways to define the QM/MM boundary for QSite.
Two methods set the boundary across a covalent bond.  In the frozen
orbital method, the boundary must be placed across a bond to an alpha
carbon in an amino acid residue.  Special parameters are used to
properly describe the energetics associated with motion of the atoms
at the QM/MM interface.  The link-atom method, also called the
hydrogen-cap method, can be used with any single bond, regardless of
the elements at the ends of the bond.  The bond in this method is
capped with a hydrogen atom, which leaves a chemically well-defined
structure with no dangling bonds.  The third method can be used only
for free (i.e., not covalently bound to anything) molecules or ions.
In this method the entire molecule or ion is placed in the QM region,
and the QM/MM &quot;boundary&quot; is simply in the space between the free
molecule and the rest of the structure.</p>

<p>A more detailed discussion of each type of boundary definition
follows.</p>


<h3>Side Chain Cuts (frozen-orbital method)</h3>

<p>To place the QM/MM boundary between an amino acid side chain and the
protein backbone, choose <span class="GUI">Side chain </span> from the <span
class="GUI">Pick</span> option menu and click on any atom in the residue.
The side chain for that residue will be placed in the QM region.</p>

<p>Side chain cuts are not possible in PRO, and are not permitted in GLY
or ALA because the side chains are so small.  Side chain cuts are also
not permitted if the side chain has been modified within 3 atoms of
the alpha carbon atom.</p>


<h3>Backbone Cuts (frozen-orbital method)</h3>

<p>In order to define a cut along the protein backbone, choose <span
class="GUI">Entire residue</span> from the <span class="GUI">Pick</span> option
menu.  You must now click on two atoms to define the range of residues to be
placed into the QM region.  All residues in between the two selected atoms will
treated as part of the QM region.</p>

<p>Backbone cuts are placed in a bond to an alpha carbon that is in an
amino acid residue, but you may click on any atom in a residue to
define a backbone cut.  The rule is that the cut will be placed so as
to ensure that the atom you select ends up in the QM region.
After you have selected two atoms, Maestro highlights the QM
region so that you can see how big it is and where the QM/MM
boundary cuts are located.</p>

<p>A backbone cut cannot be placed between an amino acid residue and an
end cap.  The end cap must be included in the QM region.  To do this
you may click on any atom in an end cap, and on any other atom in an
amino acid residue further up the chain. In this case only one cut
will actually be made, and all atoms from the cut to the end of the
chain will be placed into the QM region.</p>

<p>If you click twice on the same atom in an amino acid residue, then the
QM/MM cuts will be set as small as possible so as to place that
entire residue in the QM region.</p>

<p>There must be at least 3 bonds between pairs of QM-MM cuts that are
made along the protein backbone.  This ensures that the QM/MM
boundaries are kept far enough apart that they do not interfere with
one another.  This means that the smallest QM region that contains
all of the atoms of an amino acid residue would necessarily contain an
extra carbonyl group and an extra N-H bond from the neighboring
residues.</p>


<h3>Free Ligand/Ion</h3>

<p>In order to place an entire molecule or ion into the QM region, choose <span
class="GUI">Free ligand/ion</span> from the <span class="GUI">Pick</span> option
menu.  There are no restrictions on this selection method.  Starting from the
atom that you pick, the atomic connectivity (if any) is followed outward until
it terminates, and all atoms found along the way are considered to be part of
that molecule and are placed in the QM region.</p>


<h3>Hydrogen Caps (link-atom method)</h3>

<p>To cap covalent single bonds with a hydrogen atom, choose <span
class="GUI">Hydrogen cap</span> from the <span class="GUI">Pick</span> option
menu.  You must now click on two atoms.  The first atom is placed in the QM
region.  The second atom is replaced with a hydrogen atom (but generally at
a closer distance to the QM atom since bonds to hydrogen are shorter than bonds
to other elements). Once you have capped all desired bonds, click <span
class="GUI">Update QM Region Display</span>.  Maestro highlights all atoms
connected  directly or indirectly to the hydrogen caps, and places these
into the QM region.  If Maestro highlights many more atoms than you expect, it
probably means that you omitted a hydrogen cap somewhere such that your QM
region is still covalently bound to the rest of the system.</p>

<p>The MM sides of two hydrogen caps must have at least three bonds between them
in the MM region. That is, the MM atoms replaced by hydrogens must be at least
three bonds apart if all atoms between them are MM atoms. There are no such
restrictions on the QM sides for hydrogen caps.</p>

<h3>Recommendations and Limitations</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>The hydrogen-cap method is quite general, and not limited to
protein-ligand complexes.  You can use it on any large molecular
system, subject to the limitations of atom types and force field
parameters for the atoms that you place in the MM region.  There are a
few atom types for metals, but in many cases metals and their attached
ligands will have to be included in the QM region.</p></li>

<li><p>If you are working with proteins, and if you want to place in the QM
region a residue whose side chain has been modified, such as by
covalently attaching a ligand or some other chemical functionality,
then you may not be able to make side chain cuts (see the above
discussion of side chain cuts).  You may make backbone cuts so as to
place the entire modified residue in the QM region, or you may use
hydrogen caps.</p></li>

<li><p>To include disulfide bridges or other bridging species in the QM
region, you may either use backbone cuts or hydrogen caps.</p></li>
