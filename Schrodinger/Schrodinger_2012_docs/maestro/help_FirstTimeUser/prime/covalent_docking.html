<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>In this panel you can set up and run a job to dock ligands that are
covalently bound to a receptor. The docking job runs a Prime loop prediction to
sample the ligand and the parts of the receptor that you select for sampling.
Docking can be done to nucleic acids as well as amino acids.
</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Covalent Docking Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Covalent Docking</span> panel, do one of the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Applications &rarr; Prime &rarr; Covalent
Docking</span> in the main window.
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Tasks &rarr; Docking &rarr;
Covalent Docking</span> in the main window.
</p></li>
</ul>

<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Covalent Docking Panel</h2> 

<p>The covalent docking procedure works as follows:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The side chains of the residues selected for refinement are temporarily
removed. 
</p></li>
<li><p>The rotatable bonds of the ligand (and, if the attachment residue is
selected for sampling, the rotatable bonds in that residue's side chain) are
exhaustively sampled, producing a large number of potential poses.
</p></li>
<li><p>These poses are then clustered into about clusters.
</p></li>
<li><p>For each cluster, the side chains of the residues selected for refinement
are restored and predicted.
</p></li>
<li><p>For each cluster, the ligand, the attachment residue (if included), and
any residues specified for refinement are minimized.
</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Ligand reactive groups section</h3>
<p>In this section, you specify the reactive groups on the ligands, in which a
bond is broken to form a bond with the receptor. Each group is specified by a
SMARTS pattern and the index of the atom that leaves, with its attachments, when
the ligand bond is broken. You can specify multiple reactive groups. For each
ligand, all groups are tried for a match to the ligand, and each match is
docked.
</p>
<dl>

<a name="feature2.1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">SMARTS pattern</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>Enter the SMARTS pattern in this text box that defines the reactive group
on the ligand, or edit the pattern that is in the text box.  
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Get from selection</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Use the atoms selected in the Workspace to derive a SMARTS pattern, which

edit this pattern before adding it to the table.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature2.3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Leaving atom</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>Specify the atom on the ligand that is removed, along with the atoms
attached to it, when the ligand forms a bond with the receptor. The fragment
with the smaller number of atoms is the part that is removed. The atom is
specified by its index (position) in the SMARTS pattern; the first atom index is
1. 
</p></dd>

<a name="feature2.4"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Add</span> button</dt>

<h3>Receptor options section</h3>
<p>In this section you specify the bond in the receptor that is broken to form a
bond with the ligand, and choose residues that are allowed to adjust to the
formation of the covalent complex. The receptor must be displayed in the
Workspace. 
</p>
<dl>

<a name="feature3.1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Pick receptor bond to break</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Select this option to pick the bond in the receptor that will be broken
to form the covalent bond with the ligand, then pick the bond in the Workspace.
The atom that is attached to the smallest number of atoms is the atom that is
deleted with its attached atoms, and defines the leaving group. The bond is
marked in the Workspace with yellow markers.</p>
<p>Picking a bond to a metal is not permitted.
</p></dd>
