<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>As well as internal and bundled software and data, Prime can use certain
external third-party programs and databases for sequence and homolog searches,
protein family searches, and secondary structure prediction.  These are
described under the headings in this topic.</p>

<a name="PspThird2"></a>
<h2> BLAST/PSI-BLAST, Pfam, and the PDB</h2>

<p>These third-party databases and search facilities are described at their home
pages:</p>

<h2>Secondary Structure Prediction: Prime and SSpro</h2>

<p>Prime relies on secondary structure prediction for improving alignments and
facilitating fold recognition.  The use of multiple secondary structure
prediction programs leads to more accurate alignments and fold recognition
results.  One secondary structure prediction program (SSpro) is bundled with
Prime.  However, PRIME supports one other secondary structure prediction
program, PSIPRED V2.3.</p>

<a name="PspThird4"></a>
<h2> Secondary Structure Prediction: PSIPRED</h2>

<p>Prime supports use of the secondary structure prediction program PSIPRED V2.3 
as a third-party program.  This program may be manually installed by you, at
your election, and subject to license terms, if any, applicable to it.  At the
third-party web site whose address is given below, you may download this third
party program and install it. </p>

<p>The PSIPRED home page is located at:</p>

<p><a href="http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psipred/" target="external">http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psipred/</a></p>

<p>and contains information about the program, referrals to terms of use and/or
license terms (in the README file), and a link to download the program. The link
to download PSIPRED V2.3 is contained in the section of the page labeled
&quot;Overview of prediction methods available&quot;.</p>


<p>Instructions for installing PSIPRED for use with Prime can be found on
the <a href="https://www.schrodinger.com/Download.php?mID=8&sID=10&cID=10007"
target="external">Instructions for Compiling and Installing Third-Party Programs</a>
web page</p>
