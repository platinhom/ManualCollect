<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Users often have more than one project in progress at any given moment.
The amount of data to keep track of can be large and when done manually
this can be a tedious and cumbersome process.  The Maestro Project Facility
provides tools for management and organization of projects.  It
has tools that automate parts of this process and assist in others.
For example, when a conformational search in MacroModel finishes, all of
the resulting structures can be easily incorporated into a project
as entries.  They are then easily and quickly accessible.
</p>

<a name="projectoverentry"></a>
<h2>What Is An Entry?</h2>

<p>An entry is a collection of atoms.  That is, an
entry consists of one or more molecules (structures) grouped
together and assigned a name.  Bonds may NOT span
entries.</p>

<p> There is one entry per numbered row in the Project Table, and its title
appears on that row in the <span class="GUI">Title</span> column.  The
title is initially set to the entry name, but can be changed by the user and is
not otherwise modified by Maestro. Maestro also assigns a unique ID to the
entry, and uses this entry ID internally to identify the entry. </p>

<p>Entries can be collected into <i>entry groups</i>. Entry groups appear at the
end of the table. When you create a group, the entries are moved to a location
below the group row. The table row for the group does not have a row number. </p>

<h2>What Is a Project?</h2>

<p>A Maestro project is a collection of entries and their associated data.
Associated data includes things such as properties generated from the output of
computational jobs.<p>

<a name="project_scratch"></a>
<h3>Scratch Project - a special type of project</h3>

<p>A <i>scratch project</i> is a temporary Maestro project, created automatically
so that Maestro can always have a project open, even before any
persistent project has been opened and also when the current project
is closed or deleted. If a scratch project is not renamed to a permanent
location before it is closed, then it is deleted when it is closed. <p>

<h3>Interacting With a Project</h3>

<p>The <span class="GUI">Project Table</span> is the way in which users
interact with a project.  This is a panel that contains a table consisting of
rows of entries and columns of properties.  The row number is not really a
property of the entry, but is merely a label in the table.</p>

<p>There are several &quot;fixed&quot; properties of an entry: the entry ID,
the title (<span class="GUI">Title</span> column), the inclusion state
(<span class="GUI">In</span> column), and the surface data availability,
hypothesis availability, vibrational data availability, and trajectory
availablility (also in the <span class="GUI">Title</span> column). These
properties cannot be deleted from an entry.
</p>

<p>The <span class="GUI">In</span> column indicates whether a copy of the entry
is included (displayed) in the Workspace. An X indicates that the entry is
included, and a padlock icon indicates that an entry is fixed in the
Workspace. &quot;Fixed&quot; means that the entry must be explicitly excluded
from the Workspace for it to be undisplayed: it cannot be excluded by default.
See <a href="project_synchronize.html">Saving Workspace Changes</a>
for more information on how the Workspace and the Project interact. </p>

<p>The Project Table is <i>not</i> a spreadsheet.  That is, it does
not allow entry of formulas. However, you can import and export data from the
Project Table in a format that can be used by other spreadsheets, and you can
calculate new properties from existing properties using the <a
href="../pt_table_menu/project_table_calculator.html">Project Table calculator.</a></p>

<p>Maestro provides support for project management as well as setup, control and
incorporation of the results of jobs, both structures and properties.</p>

<h2>Important Project Facility Facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Only one project can be open at a time. </li>
<li>You are always working in a project.
Sometimes it is a <a href="scratch_project.html">scratch project</a>.</li>
<li>Projects are persistent.</li>
<li>Workspace changes can be saved in 3 different ways: auto (save changes
immediately), prompt (prompt to save changes), manual (explicit save required).
The default is auto.</li>
<li>Opening or creating a new project implicitly closes the current project.</li>
<li>Entry names may not begin with &quot;Scratch&quot;.</li>
<li><a href="project_selinc.html">Selection and Inclusion</a> are <i>different</i> concepts in Maestro</li>
</ul>
