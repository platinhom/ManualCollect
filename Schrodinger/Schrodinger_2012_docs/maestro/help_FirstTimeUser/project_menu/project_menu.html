<p>This menu provides commands that perform actions on projects. At the end of
the menu is a list of recent projects that can be opened by choosing the menu
item for the project. The other menu items are as follows:
</p>

<ul>

<li><p><span class="GUI">2D Viewer</span>&mdash;Open the 
<a href="2D_viewer.html"><span class="GUI">2D Viewer</span> panel</a>, to
display 2D structures in a rectangular grid.
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Summary</span>&mdash;View and add summary information
for the project. Opens the <a href="project_summary_panel.html"><span
class="GUI">Project Summary</span> panel</a>, in which you can see information
on project entries, runs, and jobs, and view, add, or delete annotations.

<li><p><span class="GUI">New</span>&mdash;Create a new project. The current
project is closed.
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Open</span>&mdash;Open a project. Displays a project
selector in which you can navigate to the desired project.  The current project

</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Close</span>&mdash;Close the current project. A scratch
project is created to replace it. 
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Save As</span>&mdash;Save the project under a new name,
and continue working in the new project. The old project remains as it was when
you performed the save.

uncompleted jobs started from this project will finish, but cannot be
incorporated. 
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Publish</span>&mdash;Create a web page (HTML file) with
a relative link to the project, which is stored as a zip file
(<code>.prjzip</code>). You can provide a summary of the project, which is
included in the web page. The page and project can then be placed on a web site.
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Change Directory</span>&mdash;Change Maestro's working
directory, using a directory chooser. You can also change the directory in the
<span class="GUI">Commands</span> text box with the <code>changedirectory</code>
Maestro command.
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Save Workspace Changes</span>&mdash;Save changes in the
Workspace to the project. This item is only available if you have your project
synchronization preference set to <span class="GUI">Only when specifically
requested</span> (in the <a href="../maestro_menu/preferences.html#project_entry"> 
<span class="GUI">Project - Entry changes</span> tab</a> of the <span
class="GUI">Preferences</span> panel) and you have made changes to the

another project. Opens a project selector, then a dialog box to choose the
entries.

for saving as a compressed file (<code>.prjzip</code>, the default), for copying
only the selected or included entries, for inclusion of workflow data from
CombiGlide, Phase, or Prime, and for saving in Suite 2012 project format. Plots
are only copied if you copy all entries to the new project.

<li><p><span class="GUI">Merge</span>&mdash;Merge another project into the
current project. Opens a project selector, in which you can navigate to and
select the project to merge. 
</p></li>

<li><p><span class="GUI">Back Up</span>&mdash;Make a backup copy of the
project in a zip file (<code>.prjzip</code>); the copy is stored in the
directory <i>project</i><code>.backup</code>, where
<i>project</i><code>.prj</code> is the name of the project.  
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Restore from Backup</span>&mdash;Restore the state of a
project from a backup copy. The project is overwritten by the backup.
</p></li>

</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Revert to Saved State</span>&mdash;Revert the state of
the project to the last saved state, discarding changes made since it was last
saved.
</p></li>

changes made since the project was opened. This action requires that the project
was saved in compressed form when it was closed (see the <a
href="../maestro_menu/preferences.html#project_closing"><span class="GUI">Project -
