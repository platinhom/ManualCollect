<p>To duplicate the selected entries, choose <span class="GUI">Entry &rarr;
Duplicate</span> in the 
<a href="../project_facility/project_table.html"><span class="GUI">Project
Table</span> panel</a>.
</p>
<p>There is no panel or dialog box associated with this command. </p>

<p>Each new entry is placed immediately below its source entry. If any of the
selected entries is grouped, the duplicated entry is added to the same group. 
The new entries retain the same entry name as the originals. The title is
preserved when the copy is made.</p>

<p>If a single entry is selected and is also included in the Workspace, the
source entry is excluded and the duplicated entry is included in the
Workspace. When the entry is duplicated, synchronization of the Workspace with
the entry is performed according to the synchronization preference (see the <a
href="../maestro_menu/preferences.html#workspace_changes">Workspace -
Changes</a> preferences section of the <a
href="../maestro_menu/preferences.html">Preferences Panel</a> topic). Any
changes that were made to the Workspace that were not synchronized are
transferred to the duplicated entry.
