<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The WM/MM Scoring panel allows you to set up and run a job for estimation of
the free energy of binding, using Prime MM-GBSA for the terms involving the
internal energies, Coulomb and van der Waals interactions, ligand desolvation,
and internal strain, and the WaterMap score for the water displacement
terms.
</p>

<a name="section2"></a>
<h2>Opening the WM/MM Scoring Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">WM/MM Scoring</span> 
panel:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Click <span class="GUI">Perform WM/MM Scoring</span> in the 
<span class="GUI">WaterMap - Examine Results</span> panel.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<a name="section3"></a> 
<h2>Using the WM/MM Scoring Panel</h2> 

<p>The panel can be used for scoring a congeneric series of ligands, in which
the ligands do not induce any changes in the protein (side-chain flips, for
example), there are no water-mediated hydrogen bonds, and there are no
significant contributions from protein or ligand strain or conformational
entropies to the relative binding free energy.
</p>

<p>To prepare the system, you should use the full protein preparation work flow
in the Protein Preparation Wizard, including the restrained minimization with
the crystal lead in the active site. For the ligands, members of the congeneric
series should be built by making peripheral additions to the core of this lead.
The series should not change the charge on the ligand. 
</p>

<p>The job performs the Prime MM-GBSA calculation with the options set in the
panel, and constructs the WM/MM score from the MM-GBSA results and the WaterMap
results. You can distribute this job over multiple processors.
</p>

<p>If you want to run this job from the command line with the
<code>prime_mmgbsa</code> command, you should use the <code>-watermap</code>
option to specify the location of the WaterMap results (structure file). 
</p>

<p>After preparing your structures, you can set up the calculation as follows:
</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Specify the source of the structures.
</p>
<p>You can take structures from a Pose Viewer file (Glide output), or from
separated ligand and protein structures. If you choose the latter option, you
must ensure that the ligands and the protein are properly prepared and aligned.
The protein structures must be WaterMap structures, which you can take from a
file or from the Workspace entry.
</p> 
</li>
<li><p>(optional) Choose calculation settings.
</p>
<p>If you want to use ligand partial charges evaluated by some other program,
such as QSite, select <span class="GUI">Use ligand input partial charges</span>.
The input partial charges on the ligand will then be used instead of those
assigned using the default force field.</p> 
</li>
<li><p>(optional) Specify a region within a certain distance of the ligand for
which the protein structure will be relaxed in the calculation. </p>
<p>By default, all protein atoms are frozen, and only the ligand structure is
relaxed. The larger the flexible region, the longer the calculation will
take.
</p></li>
<li><p>(optional) Choose a sampling method for the flexible protein residues.
The default is to minimize them. You can instead choose to minimize just the
side chains, to allow them to move in response to the ligand; or to minimize
just the polar hydrogens, to optimize them for hydrogen bonding. <!-- You can also do
a full side-chain prediction, to allow for a change in conformation on ligand
binding.  -->In addition, you can constrain the residues so that they do not move
very much from their input position. 
</p></li>
<li><p>Click <span class="GUI">Start</span> to make job settings in the 
<span class="GUI">Start</span> dialog box and run the job, or click 
<span class="GUI">Write</span> to write the input file and run the
job from the command line.
</p>
<p>When you set up the job in the <span class="GUI">Start</span> dialog box,
you can set the number of CPUs and number of subjobs if you are running the job
on a multiprocessor host or submitting it to a queuing system. The ligand set is
divided between the specified number of subjobs.</p> 
</li> 

</ol>

<p>If you want to start over, click <span class="GUI">Reset</span>.

<h3>Structures section</h3>

<p>Specify the source of the ligands and the receptor. The ligands must be
pre-positioned with respect to the receptor, and the receptor must be prepared
as for a Prime refinement calculation. You should remove explicit waters and
ions. If you read structures from a file, you
can use uncompressed (<code>.mae</code>) or compressed
(<code>.maegz</code>, <code>.mae.gz</code>) files.</p> 

<dl>
<a name="feature2.1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Take complexes from a Maestro Pose
Viewer file</span> option and controls</dt>
<dd><p>If you want to use a pose viewer file for both the receptor and the
ligands, select this option. To specify the file, enter the file name and path
in the text box, or click <span class="GUI">Browse</span> and navigate to the
file.
</p></dd>

<p>This section allows you to define flexible residues in the protein and how
they are treated. The distances are defined using all ligands processed.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><span class="GUI">Distance from ligand (&Aring;)</span> text box and option
menu</dt>
<dd><p>Specify the distance from the first ligand within which protein residues
are treated as flexible. Any protein residue with an atom that lies inside this
distance is considered flexible. </p>
<p>If you want to add or exclude residues, choose <span class="GUI">also
add</span> (OR), <span class="GUI">exclude</span> (AND NOT), or <span
class="GUI">intersect (AND) with</span> and specify the residues with the
picking tools below this option.
</p></dd>
<dt>Picking tools for adjusting flexible region</dt>
<dd><p>Use these picking tools to define the residues that are to be added or
excluced, or that are used to limit the region around the ligand. Enter an ASL
expression in the <span class="GUI">ASL</span> text box, select <span
class="GUI">Pick</span> and pick atoms in the Workspace, or use one of the
buttons to select the residues:
<ul>
<li><span class="GUI">All</span>&mdash;include all residues</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Selection</span>&mdash;use the Workspace selection. This
requires the protein to be in the Workspace.</li>
