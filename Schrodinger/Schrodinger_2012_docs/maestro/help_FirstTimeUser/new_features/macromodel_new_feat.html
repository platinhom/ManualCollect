<p>The following features have been added to MacroModel 9.9 in Suite 2012: 
</p>

<ul>

<li><p>The <a href="../macromodel/constraints_tab.html"><span
class="GUI">Constraints</span> tab</a> in the MacroModel energy 
panels has been redesigned. Instead of buttons, there are tabs for each type of
constraint. The force constants and widths of the flat-bottomed potentials
can be edited, and can be set for multiple constraints simultaneously.
Constraints can be imported from and exported to <code>.sbc</code> files. 
</p></li> 

<li><p>A script for conformational sampling of macrocycles has been added.
This script is available from Maestro in the <span class="GUI">Macrocycle
Conformational Sampling</span> panel and from the command line as
<code>macrocycle_conformational_sampling.py</code>. 
</p></li> 

<li><p>The use of ASL1 and ASL2 relative constraints is supported for serial
conformational searches.
</p></li> 

<li><p>The <code>bmin</code> command can be used for distributed jobs as well as
serial jobs. The former utility for distributed jobs, <code>para_bmin</code>,
is still available, but is essentially a synonym for <code>bmin</code>. With
this change, three options of the former <code>para_bmin</code> are deprecated:
<br/>
<code>-GZIP</code> : This option is no longer needed because the compression of
the output file is controlled by the file extension, and defaults to compressed
(<code>.maegz</code>).<br/>
<code>-ROBUST</code> : This option attempted to rerun subjobs. Its functionality
is superseded by the <code>-MAX_RETRIES</code> option, which specifies the
number of times to retry a failed subjob.<br/>
<code>-SUBINTERVAL</code> : This option has been removed. 
</p></li> 
</ul>

<p>The following features were added to MacroModel 9.9 in Suite 2011:
</p>


<ul>

<li><p>You can do a <span class="GUI">Perform Automatic Setup</span> for pure
low-mode (LMOD) and large-scale low-mode (LLMOD) calculations.
</p></li> 

<li><p>In the <span class="GUI">Substructure</span> tab, the number of
substructure atoms, number of fixed atoms, and number of frozen atoms is
displayed at the bottom of the tab. 
</p></li> 

<li><p>The <code>bmin</code> command now supports distributed jobs, and can be
used instead of <code>para_bmin</code>, which is deprecated.
</p></li> 

<li><p>Improvements have been made in the ring templating script. 
</p></li>

</ul>
