<p>New features in Schr&ouml;dinger Suite 2012 that apply to multiple or all
products are listed below. These features include changes to Job Control,
support scripts, and utilities. For information on graphical tools, see
<a href="tools_new_feat.html">New Features of Graphical Tools</a>.
</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> This suite is likely to be the last suite in which Linux-x86
32-bit software is supported.
</p>

<ul>

<h4>Installation</h4>

<li><p>On Linux, a choice is offered to install all modules or to select modules
for installation.
</p></li> 


<h4>Job Control</h4>

<li><p>Transfer of data to and from a cluster now takes place via an ssh tunnel
by default. This mechanism should address many problems relating to
firewalls.
</p></li> 


<h4>Filters and Converters</h4>

<li><p>Converting PDB files to Maestro includes reading of temperature and pH
data from PDB files and adding them as Maestro properties, s_pdb_PDB_EXPDTA,
r_pdb_PDB_EXPDTA_TEMPERATURE, and r_pdb_PDB_EXPDTA_PH. Converting Maestro files
to PDB format includes EXPDTA records and the corresponding REMARK records.
</p></li> 
<li><p>A template has been added to <code>mmpdb</code> for cacodylate ion (CAC),
as the OPLS force fields now include arsenic parameters.
</p></li> 
<li><p>Nonstandard residue names are converted to standard names when exporting
to MOL2 format.
</p></li> 

<h4>Tools and Utilities</h4>

<li><p>A graphical tool (<span class="GUI">Diagnostics</span> panel) has been
added for running tests and reporting on licensing and host-related
conditions. The tool can be run from the command line as 
<code>$SCHRODINGER/diagnostics</code>, from the <span class="GUI">Help</span> 
menu in Maestro, or as an application on Windows or Mac. This tool should be
used to gather information to send to technical support.
</p></li>


<li><p>A utility has been added for validating Maestro files, named
<code>maevalidate</code>.
</p></li>

<li><p>A utility for zipping and unzipping files has been added, named
<code>ziputil</code>. This utility can handle large zipped archives that other
zip facilities fail on. 
</p></li> 

<h4>Force Fields</h4>

<li><p>Improvements were made in the OPLS_2005 force field for tetrazoles, to
correct the dependence of the partial charges on the Lewis structure.
</p></li> 

<li><p>Changes have been made to the glycine backbone torsions in OPLS_2005.
</p></li> 

</ul>
