<h2>Build Homology Model Panel Features</h2> 

<ul>
<li><a href="#feature0">Query and search buttons</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature1">Model selection options</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature7"><span class="GUI">Method</span> tab</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature5"><span class="GUI">Settings</span> tab</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature4"><span class="GUI">Ligands</span> tab</a></li>

<li><a href="#feature2"><span class="GUI">Hetero-multimer</span> tab</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature6">Action buttons</a></li>
</ul>

<a name="feature0"></a>
<h3>Query and search buttons</h3>
<p>If you don't already have a query sequence, an alignment, and structures for
the templates, you can use the three buttons at the top of the panel to perform
these tasks. Clicking these three buttons in turn performs the most basic
homology modeling tasks. However, you might want to adjust the alignment before
proceeding to build the model, which you can do in the main panel. </p>

<ul>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Import Sequence</span>&mdash;Import the query sequence
as a new query. Opens the <span class="GUI">Import Sequence</span> dialog box,
so you can  locate and import the sequence.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Find Templates</span>&mdash;Run a BLAST search to
identify potential templates. Opens the <span class="GUI">Blast Search
Settings</span> dialog box, to make settings and run the job.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Get Structures</span>&mdash;Import structures from the
PDB for the current templates.</p></li>
</ul>

<a name="feature1"></a>
<h3>Model selection options</h3>
<p>These options are used to select the kind of model that is built: a single
chain model from a single template, from selected regions of multiple templates,
or from a consensus of multiple templates; a homo-multimer model; or a
hetero-multimer model. The templates must have PDB structures associated with
them before you build the model. If any of the templates do not have PDB
structures, you must import the structures. 
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#feature1.1"><span class="GUI">Select a single template to build a single chain model</span> option</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature1.2"><span class="GUI">Select sequence regions to build a composite/chimera model</span> option</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature1.3"><span class="GUI">Select multiple templates to build a homo-multimer model</span> option</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature1.4"><span class="GUI">Select multiple templates to build a consensus model</span> option</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature1.5"><span class="GUI">Build a hetero-multimer model</span> option</a></li>
</ul>

<dl>

<a name="#feature1.1"></a></li>
<dt><span class="GUI">Select a single template to build a single chain
model</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Select this option to build a model for a single chain from a single
template. The template must be selected from the available sequences in the MSV,
and must have a PDB structure imported. 
</p></dd>

<a name="feature1.2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Select sequence regions to build a composite/chimera
model</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>To build a model for a single chain that makes use of several templates,
each in a different region of the query, select this option. To select the
regions from each template, drag over the residues that you want to use in the
template. When you select this option, the sequence section is outlined in red
and the color scheme is removed. The residues used for each region are marked
with a different color for each template. The templates that are used are the
ones in which you select residues. By default, all residues in the first
template are selected, but you can select all residues in another template by
clicking the template name. 
</p></dd>

<a name="feature1.3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Select multiple templates to build a homo-multimer
model</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Select this option to build a homo-multimer. Each template chain must be
aligned to the query, and you must select all of the chains that you want to use
to build the model. The structures for each template chain must be in the
correct relative orientation and location to build the multimer. This usually
means that the template will itself be a homo-multimer, but it could also be a
hetero-multimer with a high sequence identity between the chains. You can align
the chains of the template using multiple sequence alignment, or separately with
<span class="GUI">Align and Merge</span>. If the template is a heteromultimer,
you could also build the homomultimer as if it was a heteromultimer. 
</p></dd>

<a name="feature1.4"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Select multiple templates to build a consensus
model</span> option</dt> 
<dd><p>Select this option to build a model that is a consensus of several
templates. Each alpha carbon is placed at the position where the largest number
of templates places that carbon. The template structures must be prealigned. 
</p></dd>

<a name="feature1.5"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Build a hetero-multimer model</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Select this option if you want to build a hetero-multimer model. The
<span class="GUI">Hetero-multimer</span> tab is displayed, so you can select the
queries and templates for the multimer. You must do the alignment for each query
before you select the queries as templates for the multimer.
</p></dd>

</dl>

<a name="feature7"></a>
<h3>Method tab</h3>

<p>Choose the method for building the model in this tab, from the following two
methods: 
</p>

<ul>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Knowledge-based</span>&mdash;Construct insertions and
close gaps using segments from known structures. With this option, you can
choose to return multiple models of the structure. By default, only one is
returned. The models are approximately ordered by the sequence identity and the
incidende of clashes in the structure. 
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Energy-based</span>&mdash;Construct and refine residues
that do not come from the template based on the energy, including building
through structural discontinuities and optimizing side chains.
</p></li>
</ul>

<a name="feature5"></a>
<h3>Settings tab</h3>
<p>This tab contains a number of settings for building structures.
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#feature5.0"><span class="GUI">Preserve the residue numbers of the
template</span> option</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature5.1"><span class="GUI">Retain rotamers for conserved
residues</span> option</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature5.2"><span class="GUI">Optimize side chains</span>
option</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature5.3"><span class="GUI">Minimize resiudes not obtained from
templates</span> option</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature5.4"><span class="GUI">Build insertions of up to <i>N</i>
residues</span> option and text box</a></li> 
<li><a href="#feature5.5"><span class="GUI">Close template junctions</span>
option</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature5.6"><span class="GUI">Close deletions</span>
option</a></li>
</ul>

<dl>

<a name="#feature5.0"></a></li>
<dt><span class="GUI">Preserve the residue numbers of the template</span>
option</dt>
<dd><p>Number the residues in the built structure the same as in the template,
as far as possible. Does no apply to consensus modeling. When using multiple
templates for a single chain, the residue numbers are taken from the first
template. Sequential numbering from 1 is used if the attempt to use template
numbering fails.
</p></dd>

<a name="#feature5.1"></a></li>
<dt><span class="GUI">Retain rotamers for conserved residues</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Retain the the rotamers for the side chains of conserved residues. These
side chains will not be optimized. This option is selected by default.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature5.2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Optimize side chains</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Optimize side chains, except for those attached to conserved residues if
<span class="GUI">Retain rotamers for conserved residues</span> is selected.
This option is selected by default.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature5.3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Minimize resiudes not obtained from templates</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>If side chains are optimized, also optimize the residues whose structure
is not derived from any of the templates. This option is selected by default.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature5.4"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Build insertions of up to <i>N</i> residues</span> option
and text box</dt>
<dd><p>If there is an insertion in the query (a template gap) that requires the
building of a loop, build the loop if it doesn't have more than the specified
number of residues, otherwise cut the query sequence and cap it with NMA and
ACE. When the template that spans the insertion is cut to build the query, the
template residue on the high side of the cut (higher residue number) is also
deleted, so that the capping does not result in steric clashes. Cutting
could be useful where there are long insertions that are not in the region of
interest. The query chain retains its name, regardless of the cuts. The option
is selected by default, with a length of 20. If it is not selected, all loops
are built.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature5.5"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Close template junctions</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>If there is a junction between two templates, close it if this option is
selected, otherwise cap the ends of the two pieces with NMA and ACE. This option
is selected by default. 
</p></dd>

<a name="feature5.5"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Close deletions</span> option</dt>
<dd><p><span class="GUI">Deletions</span> and <span class="GUI">Template
Junctions</span>&mdash;If there are deletions in the query (a query gap), join
the pieces of the template when building the structure if this option is
selected, otherwise cap the ends of the two pieces with NMA and ACE. This option
is selected by default. 
</p></dd>

</dl>

<a name="feature4"></a>
<h3>Ligands tab</h3>
<p>In this tab you can select ligands to include in the final model. 
The available ligands are listed, and you can select ligands from this list.
By default, only the ligands and cofactors within 5&nbsp;&Aring; of the chain
used for the template are included in the list. To display the full list, select
<span class="GUI">Show All</span>.
</p>

<a name="feature3"></a>
<h3>Constraints tab</h3>
<p>In this tab you can create proximity constraints for pairs of residues.  At
 least one of the residues must be in a loop, since helices and strands do not
 have the flexibility to adjust to the constraint. A harmonic constraint is added
 for the terminal heavy atoms of the side chains. If you specify a pair of CYS
 residues, a disulfide bond is formed.</p>
<p>To set a constraint, select the two residues that you want to be in
contact. The constraints are marked in an annotation row with a red curve
between the residues. To remove a constraint, select the two residues that are
constrained.
</p>

<a name="feature2"></a>
<h3>Hetero-multimer tab</h3>
<p>In this tab you can select the queries used for each unit of the
heteromultimer. The queries are listed by the tab name in the <span
class="GUI">Multiple Sequence Viewer</span> panel. Only those queries that have
been set up for model building in the <span class="GUI">Build Homology
Model</span> panel are listed. </p>
<p>To add a query to the list, you must first import it as a new query,
find a template and align it in the <span class="GUI">Multiple Sequence
Viewer</span> panel, then open the <span class="GUI">Build Homology Model</span>
panel, select the appropriate option for building the model (single chain,
composite, or homo-multimer; consensus cannot be used), and select the templates
or residues for the query. </p>
<p>When you have finished adding queries for each chain in the heteromultimer,
you can select the queries in the list and build the model. This tab is only
available when you select <span class="GUI">Build a hetero-multimer
model</span>.
</p>

<a name="feature6"></a>
<h3>Action buttons</h3>
<p>The <span class="GUI">Preview Model</span> button quickly builds a model for
previewing in the Workspace.  No optimization is done and the structure is
capped with NMA and ACE at any discontinuities.
</p>
<p>The <span class="GUI">Build Model</span> button runs the job to build the
model.
