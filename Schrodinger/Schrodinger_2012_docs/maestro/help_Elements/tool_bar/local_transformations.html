<p>Local transformations are rotations and translations of a selected set of
atoms in the Workspace. In contrast to global transformations, which only change
the viewing angle of the Workspace, local transformations change the coordinates
of the selected atoms. 
</p>

<p>Like global transformations, local rotations and translations are done with
the middle (rotation) and right (translation) mouse buttons. You can switch
between local and global transformation mode with <span
class="Keys">Ctrl+G</span> (<span class="Keys">&#x2318;G</span>), or by choosing
<span class="GUI">Edit &rarr; 
Pick to Transform</span>. You can also
switch modes temporarily by holding down the <span class="Keys">Spacebar</span>
while you perform the rotation or translation. When you release the 
<span class="Keys">Spacebar</span>, the previous mode is restored. 
</p>

<p>For a quick local transformation, you can select the atoms in the Workspace,
then choose <span class="GUI">Transform</span> from the Workspace
<a class="glossary" href="../misc/glossary.html#shortcut_menu">shortcut
menu</a>, and perform the transformation. To exit the mode, press 
<span class="Keys">Ctrl+G</span> (<span class="Keys">&#x2318;G</span>).
</p>

<p>The tools for local transformations are available from the <span
class="GUI">Transform</span> button menu, which is on the 
<a href="toolbars.html#edit"><span class="GUI">Edit</span> toolbar</a>:
</p>
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/globallocal.png">
<p>This button menu has four groups of items: 
</p>
<p><b>Display Options:</b> 
There are three options in this group, <span class="GUI">Display
H-bonds</span>, <span class="GUI">Display Contacts</span>, and 
<span class="GUI">Display Bond Lengths</span>. 
<span class="GUI">Display H-bonds</span> shows hydrogen bonds (yellow dotted
line) between the atoms you are moving and the other atoms in the Workspace;
<span class="GUI">Display Contacts</span> marks bad contacts (orange dotted
line) or ugly contacts (red dotted line) between the atoms you are moving and
the other atoms in the Workspace. Likewise, <span class="GUI">Display Bond
Lengths</span> marks bonds between the selected atoms and the other atoms with a
dotted line and the length of the bond.
</p>
<p>The display options are saved as preferences and are applied whenever you
perform a local transformation.
</p>

<p><b>Picking Choices:</b> 
The five items in this section allow you to choose the object that you want
to perform a local transformation on: <span class="GUI">Atoms</span>, 
<span class="GUI">Residues</span>, <span class="GUI">Chains</span>, 
<span class="GUI">Molecules</span>, or <span class="GUI">Entries</span>. 
When you have selected one of these items, you can click on an atom in the
Workspace to select the object. Each click replaces the previous selection. You
can drag over multiple objects to select them. 
</p>

<p><b>Show Markers Option:</b>
With this option selected, the atoms selected for transformation are marked
in the Workspace in yellow.
</p>

<p><b>Advanced:</b> This item opens the 
<a href="advtransformations.html"><span class="GUI">Advanced
Transformations</span> panel</a>, which offers the full 
flexibility for performing local transformations. 
</p>


<a name="sculpting"></a>
<p>A special kind of local transformation that includes minimization is provide
with the <span class="GUI">Structure Sculpting</span> tool, which is on the
<span class="GUI">Build</span> toolbar. </p>
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/primex_sculpting.png">
<p>With this tool,
moving the selected atoms is followed by a short force-field minimization that
includes nearby atoms. Once you enter this mode, you can select atoms and drag
them to a new location (with the left mouse button). When you release the mouse
button, the minimization starts. The selected atoms are restrained. Atoms in the
same residues have no constraints placed on them; atoms in complete residues
that are within 5&nbsp;&Aring; of these residues are restrained, and all other
atoms are frozen. The minimization proceeds for a fixed number of cycles or
until there is no significant change. During the minimization you can continue
to work on the structure. The minimization stops if you exit the mode, for
example by choosing some other action that involves picking atoms, or change the
content of the Workspace. If you select some more atoms and drag them while the
minimization is proceeding, it stops and a new minimization begins.
