<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The <span class="GUI">Project Table</span> panel is used to display
the contents of a project.  It is also the primary interface for performing
operations on selected project entries. </p>

<p>Each table row is associated with a project entry, which is a named
collection of atoms that can have multiple molecules, but can generally
be considered as a separate chemical structure.  The table columns show
properties of the entries. </p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Project Table Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Project Table</span> panel, do one of the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Click the <span class="GUI">Table</span> button on the <span
class="GUI">Project</span> toolbar in the main window.</p>
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/projecttable.png" /></li>
<li><p>
Choose <span class="GUI">File &rarr; Show Project Table</span>
in the main window.</p></li>
<li><p>Press <span class="Keys">Ctrl+T</span> (<span class="Keys">&#x2318;T</span>) in the main window. </p></li>
<li><p>Click <span class="GUI">Open Project Table</span> in the <span
class="GUI">Project Summary</span> panel. 
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>You can also set a preference in the <span class="GUI">Project -
Opening</span> tab of the <a href="../maestro_menu/preferences.html"><span
class="GUI">Preferences</span> panel</a> to open the Project Table automatically
when a project is opened.</p>

<a name="using"></a>
<h2>Using the Project Table Panel</h2>

<p>The <span class="GUI">Project Table</span> panel can be used for the
following tasks:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Controlling what is displayed in the Workspace. Entries that are
displayed in the Workspace are &quot;included&quot; entries. See
<a href="project_selinc.html">Entry Selection and Inclusion</a>
for information on including and excluding entries. You can also
display the selected entries in sequence with the
<a href="../eplayer/eplayer.html">ePlayer</a>. </p></li>

<li><p>Defining input for a program. Most computational programs accept
the selected entries in the Project Table as input.</p></li>

<li><p>Examining, editing, and displaying properties. You can add, delete, and
modify properties, you can use them to select entries, and you can plot
them.</p></li>

<li><p>Organizing structures and their data. You can sort entries by property,
rearrange entries, duplicate, delete, and merge entries. You can also create
groups of entries and perform operations on the groups. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Because many operations work on selected entries, there is a range of tools
in the <span class="GUI">Project Table</span> panel for finding, sorting,
and selecting entries.</p>

<a name="features"></a>
<h2>Project Table Panel Features</h2>

<p>The <span class="GUI">Project Table</span> panel contains a menu bar, several
toolbars, a status bar, and the Project Table itself.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#feature1">The Menu Bar</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature2">The Toolbars</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature3">The Project Table</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature5">The Status Bar</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature6">Shortcut Menus</a></li>
</ul>

<a name="feature1"></a>
<h3>The Menu Bar</h3>

<p>The menu bar contains the following menus, which are described in
separate topics:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../pt_table_menu/table_menu.html"><span class="GUI">Table</span> menu</a></li>
<li><a href="../pt_select_menu/select_menu.html"><span class="GUI">Select</span> menu</a></li>
<li><a href="../pt_entry_menu/entry_menu.html"><span class="GUI">Entry</span> menu</a></li>
<li><a href="../pt_property_menu/property_menu.html"><span class="GUI">Property</span> menu</a></li>
<li><a href="../pt_group_menu/group_menu.html"><span class="GUI">Group</span> menu</a></li>
<li><a href="../eplayer/eplayer_menu.html"><span class="GUI">ePlayer</span> menu</a></li>
</ul>


<a name="feature2"></a>
<h3>The Toolbars</h3>

<p>The toolbars provide more direct access to many of the features that are on
the menu bars. The general features and behavior of the toolbars are described
in the topic <a href="toolbars.html">Project Table Toolbars</a>. Links to the
topics that describe these toolbars are given below.
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="project_toolbar.html">Project Toolbar</a></li>
<li><a href="property_toolbar.html">Property Toolbar</a></li>
<li><a href="../eplayer/eplayer_toolbar.html">ePlayer Toolbar</a></li>
<li><a href="find_toolbar.html">Find Toolbar</a></li>
</ul>


<a name="feature3"></a>
<h3>The Project Table</h3>

<p>The Project Table itself displays information on the entries in the project
and their properties. The table has a fixed area and a scrolling area. The
row number, inclusion state (<span class="GUI">In</span>), and title are in the
fixed area. The <span class="GUI">Title</span> column also contains buttons for
entries that have auxiliary data, which are used for display of hypotheses (<span
class="GUI">H</span>), surfaces (<span class="GUI">S</span>), trajectories
(<span class="GUI">T</span>), and vibrational frequencies (<span
class="GUI">V</span>), when the relevant data are available for the entry. 
</p>

<p>Each numbered row in the table contains information for one entry, and each
column in the table contains information for one property. Entries do not have
to have values for each property displayed in the table; likewise properties do
not have to have values defined for each entry. </p>

<p>The full contents of the table cell are displayed in a tooltip when the
pointer is paused over the cell. Likewise, the full property name is displayed
in a tooltip when the pointer is paused over the heading cell, along with the
internal name. For properties that have units, the units are also
displayed in the tooltip for the column heading 
</p>

<p>Entries can be collected together in groups. Entry groups are collected at
the end of the Project Table. Groups do not have property values for the group,
only a title and a Maestro ID. The title and the sequential index of the group
are given in the <span class="GUI">Title</span> column of the table. The
contents of a group can be hidden or displayed by clicking the symbol in the
<span class="GUI">In</span> column for the group. The number of entries in the
group is displayed in the <span class="GUI">Row</span> column in square
brackets.</p>

<p><b>Navigating the table:</b> You can navigate the table in the usual way with
the scroll bars, arrow keys, and page keys. You can also scroll the table
vertically with the mouse wheel. In addition, there are some special keystrokes
for navigating groups. </p>
<ul>
<li><span class="GUI">Shift+UP ARROW</span> (<span class="Keys">&#x21E7;UP ARROW</span>) scrolls to the previous group,
placing the group row at the top of the display. Likewise, <span
class="GUI">Shift+DOWN ARROW</span> (<span class="Keys">&#x21E7;DOWN ARROW</span>) scrolls to the next group, placing the group
row at the top of the display.
</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Ctrl+UP ARROW</span> (<span class="Keys">&#x2318;UP ARROW</span>) and <span class="GUI">Ctrl+DOWN
ARROW</span> scroll in the same way as the <span class="GUI">SHIFT</span> key
combinations, but in addition, the group is expanded (if it is not already
expanded) and all other groups are collapsed.</li>
</ul>
<p>More information on using the keyboard in the Project Table is given in the
topic <a href="../misc/keys.html">Using the Keyboard in Maestro</a>.
</p>


<p><b>Selecting entries:</b>
Selected entries are highlighted in yellow. Selection of entries can be done
manually as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To select a single entry, click anywhere in the row for an unselected
entry. All other entries are deselected. </p></li>
<li><p>To select multiple contiguous entries, click the first entry, then shift-click
the last entry.</p> </li>
<li><p>To select or deselect a single entry without affecting the
selection of other entries, control-click the entry.</p></li>
<li><p>To select all members of a group and deselect all other entries
click the group row.</p></li>
<li><p>To select or deselect all members of a group without affecting the
selection of other entries, control-click the group row. If some members of
the group are already selected (but not all), all members of the group are
selected.</p></li>
<li><p>To add all members of a group to the selection, shift-click the group row.
If there are unselected entries between the group and other selected entries,
these entries are also selected.
</p></li>

</ul>
<p>You can also select entries based on their properties, using the
<a href="../pt_select_menu/esd.html"><span class="GUI">Entry Selection</span>
dialog box</a>.
</p>

<p><b>Displaying structures:</b>
Entries that are displayed in the Workspace are called <i>included</i>
entries. These entries are marked by a check mark in the diamond in the
<span class="GUI">In</span> column. Like selection, you can include a single
entry in the Workspace by clicking in this column for the entry, you can include
multiple contiguous entries by clicking this column for the first and
shift-clicking for the last, and include or exclude an entry without affecting
the inclusion of other entries by control-clicking in this column. You can also
fix entries in the Workspace by selecting the entries and choosing
<span class="GUI">Fix</span> from the <span class="GUI">Entry</span>
menu. Fixed entries are not excluded from the Workspace when you include other
entries. To exclude fixed entries, select them and choose
<span class="GUI">Exclude</span> from the <span class="GUI">Entry</span>
menu or type <span class="GUI">Ctrl+X</span> (<span class="Keys">&#x2318;X</span>).</p>

<p><b>Changing column widths:</b>You can change the sizes of the columns in two
ways. For individual columns, you can drag the border between two columns. The
cursor changes to a double-headed arrow when you do so. You can also change the
size of the columns to fit the width of the data in the columns, the heading
width, or both, from the <span class="GUI">Columns</span> button menu on the
main toolbar, or the <span class="GUI">Columns</span> submenu of the <span
class="GUI">Table</span> menu. If you double-click on the right border of a
column, it fits the column width to the width of the data. </p> 

<p>You can also select the properties that are displayed in the Project
Table. To show or hide properties, choose <span class="GUI">Show</span>
from the <span class="GUI">Properties</span> menu, and select the
properties to be shown, in the <span class="GUI">Show Properties</span>
dialog box. </p>

<p><b>Rearranging the rows and columns:</b>To move the selected entries, drag
them to the desired location, or choose <span class="GUI">Move Rows</span> from
the <span class="GUI">Entry</span> menu. The selected rows are placed after the
last unselected entry that precedes the target location. To move entries to the
beginning or the end of the table, drag them past the beginning or the end. <p>

<p>If you want to move entries into an entry group at a specific location in the
group, make sure the group is expanded first. Otherwise, if you drag entries
onto the group title row, the entries are placed at the end of the group.
</p>

<p>If you want to move entire entry groups, you can select them and then drag
the selection to a new location.
</p>

<p>To move a column, drag the column header to the desired location, including
to the fixed area, or use the <span class="GUI">Move To</span> item on the
shortcut menu to move the column. Columns that are moved to the fixed area are
placed after the standard fixed columns. To rearrange the columns, choose 
<span class="GUI">Property &rarr; Reorder</span> 
and make the desired changes in the
<a href="../pt_property_menu/reorder_properties.html"><span class="GUI">Reorder Properties</span>
dialog box</a>.</p>

<p><b>Editing table data:</b>To edit a table cell, click in the cell and make
the changes. If the entry is
not selected, it first becomes the selected entry. You must then click again in the
cell to edit it. To finish editing, press <span class="GUI">ENTER</span>
or click somewhere outside the cell you are editing. To edit a property name,
click in the header and make the changes, or choose <span class="GUI">Rename</span>
from the <span class="GUI">Property</span>
menu and edit the name in the panel that is displayed.</p>


<a name="feature5"></a>
<h3>The Status Bar</h3>

<p>The status bar, located at the bottom of the panel, displays the following
information: 

<ul>
<li>Project entry data: total number, number shown, number selected, and number
included. This information is shown by default</li> 
<li>Project group data: total number and number selected. This information is
shown by default</li>
<li>Toolbar button description. This information is displayed when the pointer
is over a toolbar button</li>
<li>Number of matches to search string. This information is displayed when
finding text.</li>
</ul>



<a name="feature6"></a>
<h3>Shortcut Menus</h3>

<p>In addition to the menus on the menu bar, the <span class="GUI">Project
Table</span> panel has shortcut menus, which
are displayed when you right-click in the table. There are three general shortcut
menus: one for entries, one for properties, and one for entry groups. In
addition, there are shortcut menus for surfaces (right-click on the <span
class="GUI">S</span> in the <span class="GUI">Title</span> column) and for Phase
hypotheses (right-click on the <span class="GUI">H</span> in the <span
