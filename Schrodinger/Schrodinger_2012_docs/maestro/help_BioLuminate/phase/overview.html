<p>Phase is a versatile product for developing a pharmacophore model from a set
of ligands, creating a 3D QSAR (quantitative structure-activity relationship)
model, and searching a set of structures for matches to the pharmacophore
model. Phase can be used for lead discovery, optimization, and expansion. It can
also be used for SAR development and alignments for third party QSAR models. </p>

<h2>Phase Tasks</h2>

<p>The tasks that you can carry out in Phase are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Building a pharmacophore model and an optional QSAR model from a set of ligands</li>
<li>Creating a pharmacophore hypothesis from a single ligand</li>
<li>Preparing a 3D database that includes pharmacophore information</li>
<li>Searching the database for matches</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these tasks is supported by a Maestro panel. </p>

<p>Building a pharmacophore model involves the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Preparing the ligands, including 2D-3D conversion and the generation of
ligand conformations</li> 
<li>Defining and identifying the pharmacophore sites in the ligands</li>
<li>Creating hypotheses by finding common pharmacophores</li>
<li>Scoring the hypotheses</li>
<li>Building a 3D QSAR model</li>
</ul>

<p>Building a database involves preparing the ligands, including 2D-3D
conversion, and can include the generation of ligand conformations and the
definition and identification of the pharmacophore sites in the ligands.
Searching for matches involves conformer generation and identification of the
pharmacophore sites in the ligands, if not done previously; locating matches to
a hypotheses; application of filters, including excluded volumes; and prediction
of the activity of the matches using the QSAR model.
</p>

<h2>Phase Interface</h2>

<p>The Maestro interface for building a pharmacophore mode is wizard-like, and takes you
through each step of the process. The interface is more flexible than a wizard,
because it allows you to exit at any step and resume the process later at the
same step-or a different step, provided that you have the data to support that
step. Default options are provided that should give good results, but you can
also choose from a range of other options to suit your purposes. 
The interface for each of the other three tasks is a single panel. </p>

<h2>Running Phase Jobs</h2>

<p>All Phase jobs can be started from Maestro. Many of these jobs generate a
large amount of data, and most of them can be distributed across multiple
processors. When you click a <span class="GUI">Start</span> button or an
action button that starts a job, a panel is displayed that allows you to set job
control information.</p>
