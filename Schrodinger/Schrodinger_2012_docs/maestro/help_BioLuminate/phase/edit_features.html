<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>The <span class="GUI">Edit Features</span> dialog box allows you to
change the content of pharmacophore features. Features are defined in terms of
SMARTS patterns. You can add patterns to both built-in features and up to three
custom features. You can edit and delete custom patterns, and you can
exclude or ignore both built-in and custom patterns in a feature.</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Edit Features Dialog Box</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Edit Features</span> dialog box:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Click <span class="GUI">Edit Features</span> in the
<span class="GUI">Create Sites</span> step of the
<span class="GUI">Define Pharmacophore Model</span> panel.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Loading Feature Sets</h3>

<p>The built-in feature sets are stored with the distribution. You can reload
them by clicking <span class="GUI">Reset All</span>. This button also clears the
custom sets.</p>

<p>You can import a feature set from a file by clicking <span class="GUI">Import
from File</span>, and navigating to the feature file.  Feature sets can be saved to a
file by clicking <span class="GUI">Export</span>, and specifying the file
location in the file selector that is displayed. </p>

<p>You can import a feature set from another run by clicking <span class="GUI">Import
from Run</span>, and selecting the desired run in the dialog box that is displayed. </p>

<p>The patterns that define a feature set are displayed in the
<span class="GUI">Pattern list</span> table when you choose the feature
from the <span class="GUI">Feature</span> option menu.</p>

<a name="EditFeatures3.2"></a>
<h3>Adding Custom Features</h3>

<p>Phase supplies six built-in features. You can augment these features with new
patterns but you cannot delete them. If these features do not meet your
requirements, you can create up to three custom features. These features have
the one-letter code X, Y, or Z. To create a custom feature, click
<span class="GUI">Add Custom Feature</span>. A dialog box opens, in
which you can name the feature. When you click <span class="GUI">OK</span>, the feature is added to the feature menu and
selected, so that you can add SMARTS patterns to define the feature.</p>

<a name="EditFeatures3.3"></a>
<h3>Using Projected Points</h3>

<p>By default, donors and acceptors are represented by vectors originating at the
donor (hydrogen) or acceptor atom. The alignment of these vectors is used to
determine whether ligands share the associated feature. Sometimes, two active
ligands can form a hydrogen bond to the same receptor site, but from different
directions. With the default representation, these two ligands would not
contribute to the same pharmacophore hypothesis. </p>

<p>You can replace the vectors with points at a specified distance from the
ligand donor or acceptor atom. These points simulate the corresponding acceptor
or donor in the receptor, and are called <i>projected points</i>. To use
projected points, select <span class="GUI">Projected point only</span>. To use
the same distance for all patterns, enter a distance in angstroms in the <span
class="GUI">Distance</span> text box, and click <span class="GUI">Set
Distances</span>. To set a distance for an individual pattern, edit the value in
the <span class="GUI">Distance</span> column of the <span class="GUI">Pattern
list</span> table for the pattern.

<p>When you select <span class="GUI">Projected point only</span>, only the
patterns that have a vector geometry and a defined projected point type
contribute to the feature. All other patterns that are not excluded are ignored.
Vector alignments are not used because the vectors have been replaced by points.
</p>

<a name="EditFeatures3.4"></a>
<h3>Adding and Editing Custom Patterns</h3>

<p>If the patterns in a given feature do not cover all the functional groups
that you want to include in the feature, you can add extra patterns. To add a
new SMARTS pattern, click <span class="GUI">New</span>. In the
<a href="new_pattern.html"><span class="GUI">New Pattern</span>
dialog box</a>, you can enter a SMARTS pattern and choose the geometry - whether
it represents a group, such as an aromatic ring, a single point, such as an
atom, or a vector, such as a hydrogen bond acceptor or donor - and the projected
point type - whether it has a direction or orientation associated with it, such
as aromatic ring orientation or lone-pair direction. Once you have added a
custom pattern, you can edit it with the <span class="GUI">Edit</span>
button or delete it with the <span class="GUI">Delete</span> button.</p>

<p>If the SMARTS pattern you want to add is similar to an existing pattern, you
can select the pattern, then right-click and choose <span class="GUI">Duplicate
Pattern</span> from the shortcut menu. The pattern is duplicated as a new custom
pattern. You can then click <span class="GUI">Edit</span> to edit the
pattern. The <a href="edit_pattern.html"><span class="GUI">Edit
Pattern</span> dialog box</a> has the same features as the <span class="GUI">New
Pattern</span> dialog box.
</p>


<a name="EditFeatures3.5"></a>
<h3>Setting the Status of Patterns</h3>

<p>Matching of patterns to ligand structures is done in the order specified in the
<span class="GUI">Pattern list</span> table. If you have added custom
patterns, you can move them up and down the list with the arrow buttons below
the list, to set their priority. You cannot change the order of the built-in
patterns. </p>

<p>If you want to exclude functional groups represented by a pattern from the
feature, you can select the check box in the <span class="GUI">Exclude</span>
column for the pattern. For example, you might want to exclude a carboxylic acid
group from being considered as a hydrogen bond donor, because it will be ionized
under physiological conditions.</p>

<p>If you want a pattern to be ignored, you can select the check box in the
<span class="GUI">Ignore</span> column. Ignored patterns are equivalent to
deleted patterns. If you want to save a custom pattern for later use, but not
use it in the current feature, select the check box in the
<span class="GUI">Ignore</span> column.</p>

<a name="EditFeatures3.6"></a>
<h3>Visualizing Patterns</h3>

<p>If you want to see a patterns for a given ligand or group of ligands, you
can display the ligands in the Workspace from the <span class="GUI">Ligands</span>
table in the <span class="GUI">Define Pharmacophore Model</span> panel,
and select the check box in the <span class="GUI">Mark</span> column
(of the <span class="GUI">Edit Features</span> dialog box) for
the pattern in the pattern list. Any occurrences of the pattern are marked in
the ligand structures.</p>

<p>You can display markers for more than one pattern, but the markers do not
distinguish between patterns. If you want to see the atoms and bonds as well as
the markers, select <span class="GUI">Apply marker offset</span>.</p>

<h3>Feature Controls</h3>

<p>There are seven controls for editing the features:</p>

<dl>
<dt><span class="GUI">Feature</span> option menu</dt>
<dd><p>Select an existing feature for editing. The patterns that define the feature
are listed in the <span class="GUI">Pattern list</span> table.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Add Custom Feature</span> button </dt>
<dd><p>Opens the <span class="GUI">Add Custom Feature</span> dialog box, in which you can
specify a name and choose a code letter for the new custom feature. The custom
feature is added to the <span class="GUI">Feature</span> option menu and

<dt><span class="GUI">Projected point only</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>When selected, patterns with vector geometry and a defined projected point
type are represented by a point placed along each vector at a specified
distance from the vector atom. This representation simulates the corresponding
features in the receptor. All other patterns are ignored.  Because the vectors
are converted into points, vector alignments are not checked or scored.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Distance</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>Specify the distance from the vector atom to place the projected point
for all patterns in the feature. You must click <span class="GUI">Set
Distances</span> to apply the value. Only enabled when <span
class="GUI">Projected point only</span> is selected.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Set Distances</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Set the distance of the projected point to the vector atom to the value
in the <span class="GUI">Distance</span> text box for all patterns in the feature.
Only enabled when <span class="GUI">Projected point only</span> is selected.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<dt><span class="GUI">SAS Options</span> button </dt>
<dd><p>Opens the <a href="sas_options_db.html"><span class="GUI">SAS
Options</span> dialog box</a>, in which you can set parameters that affect the
solvent-accessible surface area calculations used to filter hydrophobic
sites. Only available if <span class="GUI">Hydrophobic</span> is chosen from the
<span class="GUI">Feature</span> option menu.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature3"></a>
<h3>Pattern list table</h3>
<p>The <span class="GUI">Pattern list</span> table lists all the patterns
that are used to define the pharmacophore feature. You can only select one row
at a time in the table, and the text fields are not editable. The shortcut menu
allows you to duplicate a pattern as a new custom pattern. The new pattern
becomes the selected table row. </p>
<p>The table columns are described below.
</p>

<table cellpadding=5>

<tr>
<td><span class="GUI">Mark</span></td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>Column of check boxes. Selecting a check box marks the pattern on any
ligands that are displayed in the Workspace.
</td></tr>

<tr>
<td><span class="GUI">Pattern</span></td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>Pattern definition. With the exception of default hydrophobic features and
aromatic rings, the definitions are all SMARTS strings.
</td></tr>

<tr>
<td><span class="GUI">Geometry</span></td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>Designates physical characteristics of site. Can be one of group (defined by
a group of atoms), point (defined by a single atom), or vector (defined by an
atom and one or more directions).
</td></tr>

<tr>
<td><span class="GUI">Projected Point Type</span></td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>Defines the directionality of vector features. Can be an
aromatic ring, a donor, an acceptor with one or more lone pairs, or none
(non-vector feature).
</td></tr>

<tr>
<td><span class="GUI">Atom Numbers</span></td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>The list of atoms that determine the location of the site, numbered
according to the SMARTS string.  Point and vector geometries use a single atom,
whereas group geometry uses multiple atoms.
</td></tr>

<tr>
<td><span class="GUI">Distance</span></td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>Distance of the projected point from the ligand atom. This column only
applies when <span class="GUI">Projected points only</span> is selected.
To change the distance for a pattern, you can edit the value in this column.
</td></tr>

<tr>
<td><span class="GUI">Exclude</span></td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>Column of check boxes. Selecting a check box excludes the atoms in this
definition from being mapped by other definitions.  This is essentially a NOT
operator.
</td></tr>

<tr>
<td><span class="GUI">Ignore</span></td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>Column of check boxes. Selecting a check box ignores the pattern when
searching for features. Equivalent to deleting the pattern, but keeps the
pattern in the table.
