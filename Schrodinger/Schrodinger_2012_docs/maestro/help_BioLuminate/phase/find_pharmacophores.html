<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
In the <span class="GUI">Find Common Pharmacophores</span> step, you define and
select a set of variants for which you want to find common pharmacophore and
perform the search for common pharmacophores. The result is a set of hypotheses
for each selected variant.
</p>

<a name="working"></a>
<h2>Working in the Find Common Pharmacophores Step</h2>

<p>When you enter this step for the first time, a list of all available variants
in the active ligand set is computed, from the number of available sites of each
type for each ligand.  This list is usually less than the theoretical maximum,
because the ligands don't necessarily include all possible variants.  The list
is then filtered with the default settings for the number of sites before it is
displayed in the <span class="GUI">Variant list</span> table. The frequencies of
occurrence of the various features are used to determine how many occurrences of
each feature could be found in a valid hypothesis, given the number of ligands
that must be matched. These values are listed in the <span
class="GUI">Available</span> column of the <span class="GUI">Feature
frequencies</span> table.</p>

<p>The first task is to decide how many pharmacophore points to search for. The
default for both the maximum and the minimum is 5, but you can choose any number
between 3 and 7, inclusive, from the <span class="GUI">Maximum number of
sites</span> and <span class="GUI">Minimum number of sites</span> option menus.
The search then starts with the maximum number of sites, and if it does not find
any common pharmacophores, it decreases the number of sites and runs the search
again, until it either finds common pharmacophores or passes the minimum number
of sites.</p>

<p>When you set the maximum number of sites, the variant list is updated
automatically. Because this step is quick, you can experiment with different
numbers of pharmacophore points before proceeding, or you can create runs with
different numbers of pharmacophore points if you want to examine hypotheses with
different numbers of points.</p>

<p>By default, all of the active ligands (or active ligand groups) must contain
the variant for the variant to be listed. If you want to widen the search, you
can set the number of active groups that must contain the variant to a number
less than the total, in the <span class="GUI">Must match at least</span> text
box. When you have entered the number of ligands, the variant list is updated
automatically.</p>

<p>Not all the variants are likely to be useful: for example, a variant with
five acceptors might be physically unreasonable, and should be excluded from the
search.  You can limit the number of occurrences of any of the features by
entering a minimum and maximum number in the <span class="GUI">Minimum</span>
and <span class="GUI">Maximum</span> columns of the <span class="GUI">Feature
frequencies</span> table. For example, you might want variants that have between
1 and 3 acceptors. In this case you would enter <tt>1</tt> in the <span
class="GUI">Minimum</span> column of the <span class="GUI">A</span> row, and
<tt>3</tt> in the <span class="GUI">Maximum</span> column. The changes are
automatically reflected in the variant list. </p>

<p>When you have defined the list of variants, you can proceed to the search for
common pharmacophores. At this stage, you can manually select variants from the
<span class="GUI">Variant list</span> for the search. By default, all variants
are selected. You can use control-click to select or deselect a single variant,
and you can use shift-click to select a range of variants. You must have at
least one variant selected to run the search. If the search needs to decrease
the number of sites, it forms a set of variants for the smaller number of sites
based on your choices, and consistent with the constraints you applied to the
feature frequencies. </p>

<p>The common pharmacophores are identified using a binary partitioning
algorithm, in which the pharmacophores are split into progressively smaller and
more similar groups based on intersite distances. If you want to change the
minimum intersite distance, the final box size (the range of intersite distances
for which pharmacophore sites are considered to be identical), or the number of
recursions performed (maximum tree depth), you can do so by clicking 
<span class="GUI">Options</span> and setting the values in the 
<a href="find_pharma_options_db.html"><span class="GUI">Options</span> dialog
box</a> that is displayed. </p>

<p>To start the search, click <span class="GUI">Find</span>. A dialog box is
displayed, in which you can select the host, the number of CPUs to use, and the user
name on the host. </p>

<p>The results of the search can take a large amount of disk space, depending on the
number of ligands and their size and flexibility. The search results are kept inside the
run, which is stored in the Maestro project. You should make sure that you have adequate
disk space: in the temporary storage on the host or hosts on which you run the job, in
the Maestro I/O directory, and in the project. Because of the disk space requirements,
it is not advisable to run from a scratch project, which is kept by default in
<tt>/home/</tt><i>username</i><tt>/.schrodinger</tt>. Instead, you should save the
project to a disk that has plenty of free space. </p>

<p>The results of the run are displayed in the <span class="GUI">Results</span>
table, for all the variants in the list. Variants for which no hypotheses were found are
not passed to the scoring step. </p>

<span class="GUI">Minimum number of sites</span> option menu</dt>
<dd><p>These option menus allows you to select the maximum and minimum number of
sites to match (the number of pharmacophore points). The possible values range
from 3 to 7, with a default value of 5. A search is conducted for each number of
sites, starting from the maximum and decreasing the number until common
pharmacophores are found.

<dd><p>This text box specifies how many of the active ligands or ligand groups
(&quot;actives&quot;) must contain the variant in order for the variant to be
included in the list. The default is to use all actives. You can use less than
the total by entering the number to match in the text box. The number must be
between 1 and the maximum, inclusive. The maximum number of actives is displayed
to the right of the text box. The fewer actives you require a match to, the more
variants will be listed.
