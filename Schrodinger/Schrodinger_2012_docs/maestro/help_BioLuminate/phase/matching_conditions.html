<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>In this dialog box you can select options to use site-matching tolerances,
required site matches (&quot;site mask&quot;), and permitted and prohibited
matches (matching rules); and make selections or set values for each of these
features. If the hypothesis already has any of these features defined, they are
read when the dialog box opens and used to set options.
</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Matching Conditions Dialog Box</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Matching Conditions</span> dialog box:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Click <span class="GUI">Edit</span> in the 
<span class="GUI">Matching</span> tab of the
<span class="GUI">Advanced Pharmacophore Screening</span> panel.</p></li>
</ul>

<li><a href="#feature3">Site grouping buttons</a></li>

<h3>Sites table</h3>
<p>The table lists all the sites in the hypothesis. You can make settings in the
various columns of the table, which are described below.
</p>
<dl>

<dt><span class="GUI">Row</span></dt>
<dd><p>Table row index. Noneditable.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Site</span></dt>
<dd><p>Site label from the hypothesis. Noneditable.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Tolerance</span></dt>
<dd><p>Site-matching tolerance. You can enter the desired tolerance for each
site in this column. The tolerances define spheres of the specified radius
around the site points for each site in the hypothesis; the corresponding
site point on the aligned ligand must lie within this sphere for the ligand to
match the hypothesis.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Group</span></dt>
<dd><p>Index of the group that the site belongs to. 
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Must match</span></dt>
<dd><p>Specify the number of sites that must match the hypothesis. For ungrouped
sites, a check box is displayed and a match to this site is required if the
check box is selected. For grouped sites, the number of sites that must match is
displayed, along with the number of sites in the group. You can cycle through
the possible number of sites by clicking in the cell for one of the sites.</p>
<p>
You must also set the number of sites required to match to a value less than the
maximum in the <span class="GUI">Matching</span> tab of the <span
class="GUI">Advanced Pharmacophore Screening</span> panel. However if you set this
number to a value less than the number of sites selected here, the number used
is the number of sites selected.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Permitted matches</span></dt>
<dd><p>Columns for each feature type (A, D, H, N, P, R, X, Y, Z) that indicate
which type of feature can match at each site. The native feature type is always
selected and cannot be deselected. For each site, you can check the boxes for
the features for which you want to permit matches. For example, you might want
to allow a hydrophobic site to also match an aromatic ring. 
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Prohibited matches</span></dt>
<dd><p>Columns for each feature type (A, D, H, N, P, R, X, Y, Z) that indicate
which type of feature must not match at each site. The native feature type is
always unselected and cannot be selected. For each site, you can check the boxes
for the features for which you want to prohibit matches. For example, you might
want to prohibit inadvertent matching of an ionic site in any molecule in the
search to a hydrophobic site for which a match is not required.
</p></dd>

</dl>


<a name="feature3"></a>
<h3>Site grouping buttons</h3>

<p>Partial matching can be applied to multiple sites by grouping them, and
requiring a number of matches that is less than the minimum. Grouping is done
with the site grouping buttons.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><span class="GUI">Group Sites</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Place the sites that are selected in the table into a group. Opens a
dialog box that displays the number of sites in the group, and allows you to
specify the minimum number of sites in the group that must match. This value
must be less than the number of sites in the group. It can be changed later by
clicking in the <span class="GUI">Must match</span> column. The group is
given an index, which is displayed in the <span class="GUI">Group</span> column
for each of the sites, and the table rows are given a distinguishing background
color.
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Ungroup Sites</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Remove the selected sites from the group that they are in. The <span
class="GUI">Group</span> column is cleared, and the <span class="GUI">Must
match</span> column is populated with check boxes for these sites. You must have
all sites in a single group selected before this button becomes available. 
</p></dd>
</dl>

<a name="feature5"></a>
<h3>Constraints button</h3>

<p>Constraints can be applied to the distances, angles, or dihedral angles
between sites. These constraints can be set up in the <span class="GUI">Advanced
Matching - Constraints</span> dialog box, which you open by clicking this
button.
</p>


<a name="feature2"></a>
<h3>Apply options</h3>
<p>These options turn on or off the use of the corresponding feature.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><span class="GUI">Tolerances</span></dt>
<dd><p>Apply site-matching tolerances.
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Must match</span></dt>
<dd><p>Require matches to the features that are checked in the Must match
column. This feature is also known as a &quot;site mask&quot;. 
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Permitted / prohibited matches</span></dt>
<dd><p>Apply the feature-matching rules defined in the <span
class="GUI">Permitted matches</span> and <span class="GUI">Prohibited
matches</span> section of the table.
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Constraints</span></dt>
<dd><p>Apply distance, angle, and dihedral constraints. 
</p></dd>
</dl>

<a name="feature4"></a>
<h3>Save To Hypothesis button</h3>
<p>Click this button to save the settings made in the table with the
hypothesis. The settings are saved in the files <i>hypoID</i><code>.dxyz</code>
for site-matching tolerances, <i>hypoID</i><code>.mask</code> for the site
mask, and <i>hypoID</i><code>.rules</code> for the permitted and prohibited
matches. The files are saved to the project if the hypothesis was taken from the
project, or to external files if the hypothesis was imported.
