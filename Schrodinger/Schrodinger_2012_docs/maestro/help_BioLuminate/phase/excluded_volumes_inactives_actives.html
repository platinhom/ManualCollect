<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Create excluded volumes for a Phase hypothesis in regions occupied by atoms
in a set of inactives that do not overlap with atoms in a set of actives. The
actives and inactives must be prealigned to the hypothesis for which the
excluded volumes are created. 
</p>

<h2>Opening the Excluded Volumes from Inactives and Actives Dialog Box</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Excluded Volumes from Inactives and
Actives</span> dialog box:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Click <span class="GUI">Inactives and Actives</span> in the 
<span class="GUI">Excluded Volumes</span> dialog box.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Excluded Volumes from Inactives and Actives Dialog Box</h2> 

<p>The basis of this procedure for generating excluded volumes is that any
region of space in which inactives have atoms but actives do not corresponds to
a region that is not favored for activity. These are considered to be
&quot;clashes&quot;. The reason might be that the region has a receptor side
chain that has to be moved out of the way, or that there are solvent molecules
in this region that incur a penalty for replacement, or that there are
unfavorable interactions with the receptor in this region. There are, of course,
other reasons why molecules are inactive (or poor binders): for example, they
might be missing a critical pharmacophore feature. When choosing the inactives,
therefore, it is a good idea to choose those inactives that match all features
in the hypothesis. The choice of actives should be as structurally diverse as
possible, to avoid placing excluded volumes in regions that have no effect on
activity (such as non-critical solvent regions).
</p>

<p>You must ensure that the actives and inactives are aligned to the
pharmacophore hypothesis. In the <span class="GUI">Develop Common Pharmacophore Hypotheses
</span> panel, you can do this by clicking <span class="GUI">Alignment
Options</span> and making choices in the 
<a href="alignment_options_db.html"><span class="GUI">Alignment
Options</span> dialog box</a>. Otherwise, you can use the
<a href="find_matches.html"><span class="GUI">Advanced Pharmacophore Screening</span>
panel</a> with the actives and the inactives, and use the hit file for the
aligned ligands, or use the <code>phase_find_matches</code> utility.
</p>

<p>If you are adding excluded volumes from the <span class="GUI">Develop Common Pharmacophore Hypotheses
</span> panel, you must export the actives and the inactives
from the <span class="GUI">Alignments</span> table. You can right-click and
choose <span class="GUI">Export Alignments to Project Table</span>. You can then
select the desired actives in the Project Table, and export them, and likewise
with the desired inactives. You should consider actives and inactives that are
not part of the pharm set, in the light of the discussion above.

<dd><p>Specify the minimum number of inactives that must have atoms in a
non-active region for an excluded volume to be placed in that region.

<a name="feature4"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Minimum distance between active surface and excluded

<dd><p>Specify the minimum distance between the van der Waals surface of any
active ligand and the surface of an excluded volume sphere, in angstroms.
This buffer distance can be considered to simulate receptor flexibility.

<dt><span class="GUI">Excluded volume sphere radii</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>Specify the radius that is to be used for the excluded volume spheres.
Using a larger radius produces less spheres, but results in a less well-defined
