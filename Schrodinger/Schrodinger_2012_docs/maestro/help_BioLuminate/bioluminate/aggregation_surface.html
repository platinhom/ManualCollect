<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>In this panel you can generate a surface that indicates regions with a
propensity for aggregation. 
</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Aggregation Surface Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Aggregation Surface</span> 
panel:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Choose <span class="GUI">Tasks &rarr; Aggregation Surface</span> in the main
window.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Aggregation Surface Panel</h2> 

<p>Aggregation regions are defined by identifying clusters of exposed
hydrophobic residues. A molecular surface is created for a large probe molecule,
representing a protein. The surface is colored red in the regions near these
residues, which are the regions where aggregation might occur. The side chains
of the hydrophobic atoms are colored red and displayed in ball-and-stick. The
alpha carbon is also colored red, and the other backbone atoms are colored gray.
The backbone is displayed as lines.  Residues that are in contact with the
hydrophobic side chains are also displayed; all other residues are hidden. The
residues involved are colored red in the Workspace sequence viewer.</p>

<p>Once you have located aggregation regions, you might want to mutate residues
in this region to reduce the size of the region.
</p>

<p>To create an aggregation surface:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Select atoms to define the structure for the surface, if you want to
limit the calculation to part of the protein.
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose an option for the part of the Workspace structure that you want to
create the surface for.
</p></li>
<li><p>Enter a name in the <span class="GUI">Surface name</span> text box, if
you want to change the default name.
</p></li>
<li><p>Click <span class="GUI">Create Surface</span>.
</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Because the surface color scheme depends on the atom coloring, the
surface is removed if you change the atom color scheme. For a similar reason,
the surfaces are removed when you close the panel. If you don't make any
changes, the atom visibility and the color scheme are still in effect when you
close the panel. </p>
<p>If you want to create a selection from the displayed atoms, you can do so 
by right-clicking in the Workspace (not on an atom) and
choosing <span class="GUI">Visible &rarr; Select</span>.
</p>

<p>Once you have this selection, you can run a job to perform mutations on these
residues, as follows:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Choose
<span class="GUI">Tasks &rarr; Residue Scanning &rarr; Perform Calculation</span>
to open the <a href="residue_scanning.html"><span class="GUI">Residue
Scanning</span> panel</a>.
</p></li>
<li><p>Select <span class="GUI">Analyze only selected Workspace residues.</span>
</p></li>
<li><p>Click <span class="GUI">Analyze Workspace</span>. You may be prompted to
choose a chain, as only one chain at a time is mutated. 
</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The residues that were found to contribute to the aggregation region are
listed in the table in the <span class="GUI">Residues</span> tab. You can then
select any of them for mutation, define the mutations, and run the job. 
</p>

<dd><p>Choose an option to define the structure for which the aggregation
surface is computed.
</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="GUI">Workspace</span>&mdash;Compute the surface for the
structure in the Workspace. You must have only a single entry in the
Workspace.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Entire entry containing selected
atoms</span>&mdash;Compute the surface for the entry that contains the selected
atoms. This is useful if you want to view how the aggregation surface on one
protein matches residues in another protein.</li> 
<li><span class="GUI">Entire chain containing selected
atoms</span>&mdash;Compute the surface for the entire chains that contain the
selected atoms. This is useful for computing a surface for one chain of a
multi-chain protein, for example.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Selected atoms and attached hydrogen atoms
only</span>&mdash;Compute the surface for the selected atoms with their attached
hydrogens only. This option allows you to calculate the surface for only part of
a protein chain, for example.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<a name="feature2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Surface name</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>Enter the name you want to associate with the surface in this text
box. This name is used in the <span class="GUI">Manage Surfaces</span> panel to
identify the surface. 
</p></dd>

<a name="feature3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Options</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Open the <a href="aggregation_surface_options.html"><span
class="GUI">Aggregation Surface - Options</span> dialog box</a>, where you can
set parameters that control the quality and appearance of the surface, and
parameters for locating aggregation regions.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature4"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Create Surface</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Click this button to create the surface. A progress bar is displayed
above the buttons while the surface is being created. Surface creation should
take less than a minute.</p>
<p>When the surface is created, it is displayed in the Workspace and other
surfaces are hidden. To display more than one surface, use the <a
href="../surfaces/surface_table.html"><span class="GUI">Manage Surfaces</span>
panel</a>
(<span class="GUI">Window &rarr; Show &rarr; Surface Manager</span>).
