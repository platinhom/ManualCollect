<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>In this panel you can set up and run a job to dock a ligand protein to a
receptor protein, an antibody to an antigen, or form a dimer or trimer of a
single protein. 
</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Protein-Protein Docking Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Protein-Protein Docking</span> 
panel:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Choose <span class="GUI">Tasks &rarr; Protein-Protein Docking</span> in the
main window.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Protein-Protein Docking Panel</h2> 

<p>The Protein-Protein Docking panel provides an interface to the Piper program,
licensed from Acpharis.
</p>

<p>The basic algorithm is as follows. The ligand is rotated into a large number
of different orientations with respect to the receptor, and each of the ligand
orientations is translated to find the best docking score to the receptor. The
top 1000 rotations are clustered using the RMS distance between matching atoms
in each pair of rotated structures. The structure that is taken from each
cluster is the one with the most neighbors in the cluster.
</p>
<p>The structures you use should be properly prepared for docking, which mainly
means that the structure must have hydrogen atoms. This requirement is enforced
when you import structures. Although you can import structures directly from the
PDB, these structures often have missing atoms, and the missing atoms are often 
in surface residues. If these residues are important for protein-protein
docking, you should consider running a side-chain prediction 
(<span class="GUI">Tasks &rarr; Loop + Sidechain Prediction</span>)
to ensure that the critical side chain atoms are present in the structures that
you dock. You can include a side-chain prediction in the process of protein
preparation in the <a href="../workflows/protein_preparation.html"><span
class="GUI">Protein Preparation Wizard</span></a>.
</p>

<p>The basic workflow is as follows:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Choose the kind of system you want to dock, in the <span
class="GUI">Mode</span> section. You can dock antibodies to antigens and
generate dimers or trimers as well as docking two general proteins.</p></li>
<li><p>Import or select the protein structures. This includes selecting the
chains from the protein if it has multiple chains.</p></li>
<li><p>Change settings for the ligand rotations and number of poses, if desired.
</p></li>
<li><p>Set constraints for residues in the proteins to encourage docking in a
particular region, if desired.
</p></li>
<li><p>Start the docking job (<span class="GUI">Generate Models</span>). 
</p></li>
</ol>

<dd><p>Select the kind of protein-protein docking calculation you want to do
from the options in this section.
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Standard</span>&mdash;Dock a ligand protein to a
receptor protein. This is the most general docking calculation that you can do. 
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Antibody</span>&mdash;Dock an antibody to an
antigen. You can choose whether to consider the non-CDR region with the
option <span class="GUI">Mask non-CDR region</span>. By default the non-CDR is
masked, i.e. the attractive potential for residues in the non-CDR region is
removed. 
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Dimer</span>&mdash;Dock the protein to itself to form a
dimer, subject to <i>C</i><sub>2</sub> symmetry constraints.
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Trimer</span>&mdash;Dock the protein to itself to form a
trimer, subject to <i>C</i><sub>3</sub> symmetry constraints.
</p></li>
</ul>
</dd>

<a name="feature2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Protein structures</span> section</dt>
<dd><p>In this section, you specify the proteins that you want to dock. 
For each protein there is an option menu, a text box to display the title of the
protein, and a button to include the protein in the Workspace and zoom to it.
The labels on the option menus depend on the docking mode that you selected.
</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="GUI">Standard</span>&mdash;The menus are labeled <span
class="GUI">Receptor</span> and <span class="GUI">Ligand</span>. </li>
<li><span class="GUI">Antibody</span>&mdash;The menus are labeled <span
class="GUI">Antibody</span> and <span class="GUI">Antigen</span>. </li>
<li><span class="GUI">Dimer</span> or <span class="GUI">Trimer</span>&mdash;The
top menu is labeled <span class="GUI">Monomer</span>, and the bottom menu is
dimmed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each option menu has three items for selecting the source of the structure.
</p>

<ul>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Browse for File</span>&mdash;Opens a file selector so
that you can browse to the location of the file and select it. The structure is
imported into the project as a new entry, and added to the Workspace.
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">From the Workspace</span>&mdash;Use the structure that
is in the Workspace. You should ensure that only the desired structure is
included in the Workspace. 
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">From PDB ID</span>&mdash;Opens a dialog box in which
you can specify a PDB ID. The protein you specify is imported from the PDB,
either from a local copy or from the web site. It is added to the project and to
the Workspace. 
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The protein structures must be adequately prepared. If hydrogens are missing,
you are prompted to add them. If the protein has multiple chains, you are
prompted to choose the chains.
</p>

<p>When the protein is imported, the structure is added to the project and
included in the Workspace. If the structure is removed from the Workspace you
can add it with the Include and zoom button (eye icon). 
</p>

<p>To view the sequences of the proteins you imported in a sequence viewer,
click <span class="GUI">View Sequences</span>.

<a name="feature3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Number of ligand rotations to probe</span> box</dt>
<dd><p>Number of ligand rotations (orientations) to dock to the receptor. The
default of 70,000 corresponds approximately to sampling every 5&deg; in the
space of Euler angles, and is the maximum value allowed. Decreasing the number
of rotations generally degrades the results, but decreases the run time.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature4"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Maximum poses to return</span> box</dt>
<dd><p>Maximum number of poses to keep .Each pose is the center of a cluster
that results from clustering the top 1000 results of rigid docking of the
ligand.  If more clusters are found than the number of poses to return, the
clusters are ranked by size and poses are chosen from the largest clusters.  If
fewer clusters are found than the maximum number of poses to return, one pose
per cluster is returned.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature5"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Constraints</span> section</dt>
<dd><p>In this section you can define constraints on the docking process, by
providing an additional attractive term to the potential, remove the attractive
potential, or declare residues to be buried, for residues that you select.
Constraints do not guarantee that a residue will or will not participate in
binding; rather they modify the potential function, to make binding to the
residue easier or harder.
</p>

<dl>

<dt><span class="GUI">Add Constraint</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Add a constraint row to the table. 
</p></dd>

<dt>Constraints table</dt>
<dd><p>In this table you can define constraints on selected residues, to
increase or remove the attractive potential, or change the repulsive van der
Waals radius. The table columns are described below.
</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td style="padding-right: 20;"><span class="GUI">Type</span>
</td>
<td>Choose the type of constraint to apply. The types are:<br/>
<span class="GUI">Attraction</span>&mdash;Increase the attractive potential for
participation in binding. The value in the <span class="GUI">Bonus</span> column
is added to the default value of 1 to define the scaling factor for the
attractive potential.<br/>
<span class="GUI">Buried</span>&mdash;Increase the van der Waals radius and the
repulsive potential for buried residues, and set the attractive potential for
ligand or antigen residues to zero.<br/>
<span class="GUI">Repulsion</span>&mdash;Set the attractive potential to zero,
leaving only the repulsive van der Waals potential, which is not modified.
