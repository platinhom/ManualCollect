<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This panel allows you to preview the results of attachment-based core hopping
as they are being generated, and examine scores for the best output structures.
</p>

<a name="section2"></a>
<h2>Opening the Results Preview Dialog Box</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Results Preview</span> dialog box:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Select <span class="GUI">Use immediate results visualizer</span> in the
<span class="GUI">Find New Cores</span> tab of the<span class="GUI">
Ligand-Based Core Hopping</span> panel. The panel opens after you
click <span class="GUI">Start</span> and the job has started.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<a name="section3"></a> 
<h2>Using the Results Preview Dialog Box</h2> 

<p>This panel allows you to view the results of the core-hopping calculation
while it is in progress. The top-scoring 20 structures are displayed in a table
for two or three different scores: side-chain RMSD, core overlap, and
synthesizability. The third of these is only available if you use an
<code>.sqlite</code> file as input.
</p>

<p>The scores are evaluated as output structures are generated, and the results
in the tables are updated. If you want to prevent the table for a particular
score from being updated, select <span class="GUI">Freeze updates</span>. The
table is not updated until you deselect this option, and you can examine the
structures in the table. The structures are ordered from the best to the worst.
</p>

<p>To view one of the core structures in the Workspace, click on the cell for
the structure. To display the scores for a structure, pause the pointer over the
structure.

<a name="section4.0"></a>
<dt>Template structure</dt>
<dd><p>The template structure with the attachment points marked is shown at the
top of the panel, with various properties listed to the left.
</p></dd>

<a name="section4.1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Inputs processed</span> and 
<span class="GUI">Results returned</span> text boxes</dt>
<dd><p>These text box reports the number of input core structures processed, the
total, and the number of core structures found that match. They are 
updated as the structures are processed.
</p></dd>

<a name="section4.2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Progress</span> bar</dt>
<dd><p>This bar reports the progress of the job. It is only present if you
selected an <code>.sqlite</code> input file.
</p></dd>

<a name="section4.3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Substitutability Analysis</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>This text box reports the number of core structures that have been
generated, and is updated as they are processed. 
</p></dd>

<a name="section4.4"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Side chain RMSD score</span> section</dt>
<dd><p>This section reports the RMSD of the side chains of the generated core
structures with respect to the template, when superimposed on the template side
chains. The lowest scores represent the best match. The 20 structures with the
lowest RMSD values are shown in the table, ordered from the lowest to the
highest.
</p></dd>

<a name="section4.5"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Core overlap score</span> section</dt>
<dd><p>This section reports a score that is related to the overlap of the
new core and the template core. The score is evaluated by averaging the
fraction of atoms in the new core that have a template core atom within
0.5&nbsp;&Aring; and the fraction of atoms in the template core that have a
new core atom within 0.5&nbsp;&Aring;, when the side chains are superimposed.
Larger scores represent better matches.  The 20 structures with the highest
overlap scores are shown in the table, ordered from the highest to the 
lowest. 
</p></dd>

<a name="section4.6"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Synthesizability score</span> section</dt>
<dd><p>This section reports a synthesizability score. The score is based on
whether a particular substitution pattern has been observed in drug-like
molecules, and how many of the attachment points are substituted in the new core
molecule. Larger scores represent better results. The 20 structures with the
highest synthesizability  scores are shown in the table, ordered from the
highest to the lowest.
</p>
<p>This section is only present if you selected an <code>.sqlite</code> input
file.
</p></dd>

<a name="section4.7"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Freeze updates</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Prevent the table for a particular score from being updated. This allows
you to examine the results at a particular point without the table being updated
while you are doing so. Updates resume when you deselect this option.
</p></dd>

<a name="section4.8"></a>
<dt>Statistics text boxes</dt>
<dd><p>These text boxes report the best score, the worst score, the average
score, and the standard deviation of the scores. Each score type has a set of
these text boxes. They are updated as results are processed.
</p></dd>

<a name="section4.9"></a>
<dt>Structure display tables</dt>
<dd><p>These tables contain structures for the 20 best-scoring new core
structures. You can click on a table cell to view the structure in the
Workspace. The tooltip for the cells contains the scores, and a number of other
properties of the molecule.
