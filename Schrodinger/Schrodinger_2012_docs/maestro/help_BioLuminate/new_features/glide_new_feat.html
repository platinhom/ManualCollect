<h3>New Features</h3>

<ul>

<li><p>Excluded volumes can be defined during grid generation, and applied in
docking. Each volume is spherical, and has a penalty associated with it that
ramps up from zero at the edge of the sphere to its full value at some
distance inside the sphere. The feature is supported in a new <span
class="GUI">Excluded Volumes</span> tab in the <span class="GUI">Receptor Grid
Generation</span> panel, and in the <span class="GUI">Settings</span> tab of
the <span class="GUI"> Ligand Docking</span> panel.
</p></li> 

<li><p>Cysteine thiols can be selected as rotatable groups when generating
grids.
</p></li> 

<li><p>You can restrict the torsional sampling of a wider range of functional
groups than amides, in the <span class="GUI">Settings</span> tab of the <span
class="GUI">Ligand Docking</span> panel. The existing amide bond feature is
retained, but is now a choice under <span class="GUI">Bias torsion sampling
for</span>. The functional groups are specified in a resource file,
<code>torcontrol.txt</code>, in the
<code>impact-v</code><i>version</i><code>/data</code> directory, which you can
customize and place in the impact subdirectory of your user resources directory
(<code>$HOME/.schrodinger</code> on Linux and Mac,
<code>%APPDATA$\Schrodinger</code> on Windows).
</p></li> 

<li><p>The structures that are skipped or rejected during docking can be written
to a file, <i>jobname</i><code>_skipped.maegz</code> by adding the
<code>KEEPSKIPPED</code> keyword to the input file. 
</p></li> 

<li><p>Docking output can be written in SD format rather than in Maestro
format, except when XP descriptors are written or rotatable groups are present
in the grid. 
</p></li> 

<li><p>New keywords have been added for specifying constraints in the Glide
input file, which are consistent with those used in VSW. The old keywords are
still available but are no longer written by Maestro. 
</p></li> 

<li><p>A boolean property for each constraint is added to the pose file to
indicate whether the constraint was satisfied during docking.
</p></li> 
 
<li><p>The grid center can be specified with two new keywords,
<code>GRID_CENTER_ASL</code>, corresponding to <span class="GUI">Centroid of
selected residues</span> in Maestro, and <code>LIGAND_MOLECULE</code>, 
corresponding to <span class="GUI">Centroid of Workspace ligand</span> in
Maestro.
</p></li> 

<li><p>The maximum number of poses that can be compared for redundancy using
symmetry has been increased to 100, and the <code>NMAXRMSSYM</code> keyword has
been added to set this value. 
</p></li> 

<li><p>Glide has been ported to MacOSX and is now available on Mac computers. 
</p></li>
