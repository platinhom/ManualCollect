<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Intrinsic Reaction Coordinate (IRC) calculations can be used to check that the
given transition state is the expected transition state for the reaction of
interest. IRC calculations start at a transition state and move downhill in
energy along the reaction path toward a minimum of the potential energy surface,
calculating a series of points in which all geometric variables orthogonal to
the path are optimized. The calculations can run in the forward direction
(toward the products) and the backward direction (toward the reactants).</p>

<p>
The scan can proceed along either the intrinsic reaction coordinate or the
minimum energy path (MEP) calculations. The difference between the two is that
the reaction coordinate for the IRC path is mass-weighted, whereas the reaction
coordinate for the minimum energy path is not.
</p>

<p>When the calculation is finished, the structures at the IRC (or MEP) points
are automatically incorporated as separate entries in the Project Table, and the
reaction coordinate is incorporated as a property. You can then sort the entries
based on this property, and display them in sequence using the ePlayer.</p>

<h2>Running IRC Scans</h2>

<p>To set up an IRC or MEP calculation from Maestro, you must first perform a
transition-state calculation and read in the restart file, then choose
<span class="GUI">Tasks &rarr; Small Molecule Tasks &rarr; Quantum Mechanics &rarr;
Advanced &rarr;
<span class="GUI">Reaction Coordinate</span>.
</p>

<p>The calculation requires an accurate Hessian for the transition state. You
can either precalculate the Hessian and read it in from the restart file, or
make the calculation of the Hessian part of the IRC or MEP calculation. This
choice can be made from the <span class="GUI">Initial Hessian</span> option
menu in the <span class="GUI">Optimization</span> tab: to read the
Hessian, choose <span class="GUI">Other</span>; to calculate the Hessian,
choose <span class="GUI">Quantum-mechanical</span>. Do not use any of the
other options from this menu, because it is important to have an accurate
Hessian.</p>

<p>If you expect the IRC path to break symmetry, you should turn symmetry off in
the <span class="GUI">Molecule</span> tab. Symmetry is automatically
turned off if you calculate the Hessian as part of the job.  </p>

<p>You can choose the directions in which the scan proceeds from the
<span class="GUI">Direction</span> option menu in the
<span class="GUI">IRC</span> tab. The direction is determined
by the reactant and product geometries, which you can set in the
<span class="GUI">Structures</span> section. If you do not specify these
structures, Jaguar applies some rules to determine the reaction path. See the
<i>Jaguar User Manual</i> for details. You can also set the number of steps and
the step length.
</p>

<p>If you want an MEP scan rather than an IRC scan, deselect
<span class="GUI">Use mass-weighted coordinates</span>.</p>

<p>When you have finished making settings, click <span class="GUI">Start</span>.
