<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
Transition state searches are usually more demanding than optimizations to a
minimum on the potential energy surface, and are more likely to fail to
converge. The success of transition state searches depends on the quality of
the initial guess, the initial Hessian, and the search direction.</p>

<p>Jaguar provides several options for the search direction in a standard search
from a minimum energy point, all of which involve eigenvalues of the Hessian. In
addition, Jaguar uses synchronous transit methods for searches between two
structures such as the reactant and product in a chemical reaction. By
specifying the two structures - and a guess at the transition state if you have
it - the search is initially confined to the curvilinear path between the two
structures, and subsequently follows the Hessian eigenvector that is closest to
the tangent to this path.</p>

<p>The search direction is dependent on the quality of the Hessian. If the
initial Hessian is not accurate, it can be refined using a selected number of
eigenvectors of the Hessian. This refinement involves SCF and gradient
calculations for displacements along these modes, which allow more accurate
information about the most important modes to be included in the Hessian.

<h2>Running Transition State Searches</h2>

<p>To set up a transition-state search, first choose
<span class="GUI">Tasks &rarr; Small Molecule Tasks &rarr; Quantum
Mechanics &rarr; Advanced &rarr; 
Transition State Search</span>. The options specific to transition state
searches are set in the <span class="GUI">Transition State</span> tab.</p>

<p>The method of selecting structures depends on the search method.
For a standard search, which you choose by selecting <span class="GUI">Standard</span> under <span class="GUI">Search
method</span>, you select the structure from the <span class="GUI">Use
structures from</span> option menu at the top of the panel. For LST or QST
searches, this menu is not available. Instead, you select the structures
in the <span class="GUI">Structures</span> section. If you select
<span class="GUI">LST</span>, you must choose the reactant and product
structures, both of which must be entries in the Project Table.
If you select <span class="GUI">QST</span>, you must select the reactant,
product, and transition-state guess structures, all of which must be entries in
the Project Table.</p>

<p>For the LST method, you can specify how far along the path from reactant (0.0) to
product (1.0) the transition state is expected to lie in the
<span class="GUI">Initial LST guess</span> text box. The default is halfway
(0.5).</p>

<p>If you want an accurate Hessian, you can precompute it and read it in, or
request the computation of the Hessian. To read the Hessian, choose
<span class="GUI">Other</span> from the
<span class="GUI">Initial Hessian</span> option menu in the
<span class="GUI">Optimization</span> tab; to calculate the Hessian,
choose <span class="GUI">Quantum-mechanical</span>.</p>

<p>To refine the initial Hessian, select <span class="GUI">Hessian
refinement</span>, then enter the number of low-frequency Hessian eigenvectors
to be used in the refinement in the <span class="GUI">Low-frequency
modes</span> text box.
</p>

<p>When you have finished making settings, click
<span class="GUI">Start</span>.</p>

<h2>Recommendations for Transition State Searches</h2>

<p>Searching for a transition state is one of the more difficult tasks for
molecular modeling software. In contrast to geometry optimization, in which
moving downhill in energy to the nearest minimum does not require that any
particular path be followed, in transition-state searching it is essential that
the correct reaction coordinate be followed uphill to the desired transition
state. Over the years we have accumulated experience with transition-state
searching to make the following recommendations. 
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Use the QST search method, in preference to LST or the standard method.
The QST method requires the most user effort because it requires three input
structures, but it is the most likely to find the desired transition-state
structure because these three structures allow the optimizer to make the best
choice of Hessian eigenvector to follow.
</p></li>

<li><p>Prepare the three QST input structures carefully.  The extra time spent
in preparing high-quality input will be more than compensated by reduced
calculation time.
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Start by building your best guess at the TS structure. Use all of your
chemical intuition about how molecular structures change as they undergo
reactions.  Not only do bonds lengthen and shorten, but bond angles also change
as atoms change from planar hybridization to pyramidal or vice versa, and
torsional motion occurs to avoid steric clashes or to improve orbital overlap.
Make all of the changes that you think will distinguish the TS structure from
that of the reactant or product.  Another option is to perform a geometry
optimization in which you constrain those coordinates whose values you feel that
you can estimate fairly well, and let everything else relax.  The final
structure can be used as your guess at the transition state.
</p></li>
<li><p>Once you have the guess TS structure, duplicate it twice in the Project
Table. Modify the duplicates to form the reactant and product structures. Do not
optimize these structures.  In order for the QST interpolation scheme to work
well, it is essential not to use optimized product or reactant structures,
because those structures lie too far away from the transition state structure to
provide information about the reaction coordinate.  Instead, try to build
reactant and product structures that are part of the way downhill from the TS
structure. When you modify bond lengths to create the reactant and product
structures, the adjustments should be about 0.1 angstrom. When you change bond
angles, the adjustments should be about 5 degrees. Torsional changes should be
about 10-15 degrees.
</p></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><p>List any bonds that are created or broken in a connect section in the
input file. This section ensures that the specified coordinates are used by the
optimizer, which can greatly reduce the number of steps to find the transition
state. Specifying these bonds is critical when bonds are broken or
formed. Without this section, bonds that are too far outside the normal range
are not generated as internal coordinates, and therefore are not used to guide
the search.
</p></li>

<li><p>In the Optimization tab of the Jaguar panel, choose <span
class="GUI">Quantum Mechanical</span> from the <span class="GUI">Initial
Hessian</span> option menu. This is an expensive option, particularly for very
large structures, but it also provides the best possible initial Hessian.  All
of the other initial Hessian algorithms are designed for optimizations, not
transition state searches, and in particular the Hessians produced by these
algorithms are always positive definite (no negative eigenvalues).
</p></li>

<li><p>Since TS searches are often slow to converge and can sometimes fail to
find the desired TS, a two-stage approach can be employed. Use a relatively
small basis set and cheap level of theory, like B3LYP/6-31G*, to get a
transition state or close to it. Then switch to a more accurate method like
M06-2X/cc-pVTZ(-f) for the final refinement. If the transition state found by
the cheap method is very different from your starting guess stucture, then it
might be a good idea to build new product and reactant structures based on the
new transition state structure.
</p></li>

<li><p>For atom-transfer reactions, it is usually better to perform a simple
relaxed geometry scan rather than a TS search.  This is because the reaction
coordinate in this situation is completely dominated by the distance coordinate
involving the atom being transferred.  If your scan increment is small enough,
you can accurately locate the transition state.
</p></li>
