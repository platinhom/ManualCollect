<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
In this tab, you can define restraints on the optimization to satisfy
noncrystallographic symmetry. The restraints are applied to specified groups
of chains. Noncrystallographic symmetry restraints are generally used only
in the early stages of refinement.
</p>

<a name="using"></a>
<h2>Using Noncrystallographic Symmetry Restraints</h2>

<p>Noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS) is imposed at the chain level. To impose this
symmetry, you create groups of chains or chain segments that are related by
NCS. The parts of the chains that are considered to be related must have
identical atom composition, so you must omit residues that differ between the
chains. Restraints can be applied to backbones as well as whole residues.</p>

<p><b>To set up a chain group:</b></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Click <span class="GUI">Add</span>.</p>
<p>A new group is added to the Groups table. If groups have been defined
previously, the group is initialized with the chains that have not yet been
used. If all chains have been used in previous groups, the group is initialized
with all chains, so that you can make other connections between chains than have
already been defined.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Edit the <span class="GUI">Chains</span> cell in the table to include
only the desired chains.
</p></li>
<li><p>Check whether the chains have identical residues.</p>
<p>You can use the sequence viewer in the Workspace to compare the chains, and
you can click on residues to select them in the Workspace. You should check that
the residues have the same atoms: if they do not, they must be omitted from the
group.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>List the residues in the <span class="GUI">Residues to omit</span> cell
of the table.</p>
<p>The list is a comma-separated list of residue numbers (including insertion
codes) or ranges, such as 223-226a.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Click the box in the <span class="GUI">Backbone only</span> column if you want
to apply restraints only to the backbone.
</p></li>
<li><p>Set weights of the restraints for the B-factors and coordinates if desired.
</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>NCS Tab Features</h2>

<p>The features in this tab are a <span class="GUI">Groups</span> table that
lists the parts of the structure that are to be restrained, and
<span class="GUI">Add</span> and <span class="GUI">Delete</span> buttons, to add
groups to the table or delete groups from the table.
</p>

<p>To add a group to the table, click <span class="GUI">Add</span>. A new row is
added, and the <span class="GUI">Chains</span> column is populated with the
chains that have not been used previously. The B-factor weight and coordinate
weight are set to the default values.
</p>
<p>To delete a group, select it in the table and click
<span class="GUI">Delete</span>.
</p>
<p>To edit a table cell, click in the cell, make changes, then press <span
class="GUI">ENTER</span>.
</p>

You can use ranges, such as 120-128, in the list. If the chains are not identical,
you must omit residues that differ between chains or are missing from some chains
in the group.
