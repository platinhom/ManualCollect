<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>In this panel you can create a QSAR model for the activity as a function of
the kind of R-group at each attachment position, and display the results
qualitatively in terms of increasing the activity, decreasing the activity, or
little effect on the activity.
</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the R-QSAR Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">R-QSAR</span> 
panel:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Click <span class="GUI">R-QSAR</span> in the 
<span class="GUI">R-Group Viewer</span> panel.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the R-QSAR Panel</h2> 

<p>The QSAR model is built using counts of pharmacophore features present in the
R groups at each position as the independent variables. The pharmacophore
features are the standard features used in Phase QSAR models: hydrogen-bond
acceptor (A), hydrogen-bond donor (D), hydrophobic (H), negatively-charged (N),
positively-charged (P), and aromatic (R).</p>
<p>
A partial-least-squares (PLS) procedure is used to fit the data, assigning 75%
of the data to the training set and 25% to the test set at random. The fitting
is repeated many times, each time picking the best model that does not  
overfit the data (which occurs when the standard deviation of the fit is smaller
than the error in the property being fit). The mean of the coefficients from all
of these trials is used to determine whether a feature at a given position
contributes significantly to the property, either positively or negatively: if
the absolute value of the mean is greater than the supplied cutoff, the
contribution is considered significant. </p>
<p>When the calculation finishes, the attachment positions are labeled with a
list of the six pharmacophore features, colored by significance: red for
significant positive contributions, blue for significant negative contributions,
and gray for insignificant contributions. If a pharmacophore feature is absent
from an attachment position, a lower-case letter is used for the pharmacophore
feature type. 
</p>

<p>To generate a QSAR model:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose a property from the <span class="GUI">Property</span> option menu</li>
<li>Specify the error in the property in the <span class="GUI">Error</span>
box.</li>
<li>Specify the cutoff for significant contributions in the <span
class="GUI">Importance cutoff</span> box. </li>
<li>Click <span class="GUI">Start</span></li>

</ol>

<a name="feature1"></a>
<dt>Display area</dt>
<dd><p>Displays the core, annotated at each attachment point with the
pharmacophore feature types and their contribution to the selected property. The
annotation consists of the six letters of the pharmacophore feature
types. Features that have significant negative contributions to the property are
colored blue and placed on the left. Features that have significant positive
contributions to the property are colored red and placed on the right. Features
that have insignificant contributions are colored gray and placed in the middle.
Features that were not found at a given attachment point are shown in lower
case.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Property</span> option menu</dt>
<dd><p>Choose the property used for the activity from this option menu. A
message is displayed to the right, indicating how many of the structures
analyzed have the selected property.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Error</span> option menu</dt>
<dd><p>Enter the estimated error in the values of the property in this box.  The
value can be derived however you like. It is used to check for overfitting in
the PLS procedure: the number of factors used is the largest number at which
standard deviation of the regression is larger than the error given in this
box. 
</p></dd>

<a name="feature4"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Importance cutoff</span> option menu</dt>
<dd><p>Specify the cutoff on the mean value of the PLS coefficient for a
pharmacophore feature to be considered to significantly affect the predicted
property. The units of the cutoff are the same as those of the property.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature5"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Start</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Start building the QSAR model. When the model is built, the structure is
annotated with the pharmacophore types, colored according to their contribution
to the selected property. 
</p></dd>

<a name="feature6"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Display Summary</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Display a summary of the information obtained from the
partial-least-squares procedure. For each pharmacophore type, the minimum,
maximum, mean, and standard deviation for the PLS coefficient is given, and the
assessed effect on the activity is listed, as weak, positive, or negative.
