<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
The <span class="GUI">Settings</span> tab
defines the basic options for docking ligands
using previously calculated grids.
</p>

<a name="features"></a>
<h2>Settings Tab Features</h2>

<p>There are two sections containing options in this tab, and a button that
provides access to more options.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#feature1"><span class="GUI">Receptor grid</span> section</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature2"><span class="GUI">Docking</span> section</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature3"><span class="GUI">Advanced Settings</span> button</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Receptor Grid Section</h3>

<p>Ligand docking uses receptor grids, which are specified in this section.
Click <span class="GUI">Browse</span> to open a file selector and choose
a grid file for your docking job to use. You can choose either the grid file
itself (<tt>.grd</tt>) or a compressed set of grid files (<tt>.grd.zip</tt>). If
you choose a compressed set of files, they are automatically uncompressed by the
job. The file name, without the extension, is displayed
in the <span class="GUI">Receptor grid base name</span> text box.
You can also enter the base name directly into the text box.
</p>
<p>There are two other options in this section:
</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="GUI">Display receptor</span>&mdash;Display the receptor in the
Workspace. </li>
<li><span class="GUI">Show grid boxes</span>&mdash;Display the outer (purple)
and inner (green) grid boxes in the Workspace, and the grid center. These are
the boxes that are displayed when you set up the grid calculation. The box
parameters are stored in the Maestro file for the receptor. (Grid boxes cannot
displayed for grids generated with software prior to Suite 2012.)</li>
</ul>

<dl>
<a name="feature2.1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Precision</span> option menu</dt>
<dd><p>Glide has three precision options on this option menu:</p>
<dl>
<dt><span class="GUI">HTVS (high throughput virtual screening)</span></dt>
<dd><p>
High-throughput virtual screening (HTVS) docking is intended for the rapid
screening of very large numbers of ligands. HTVS has much more restricted
conformational sampling than SP docking, and cannot be used with
score-in-place. Advanced settings are not available for HTVS,
but are fixed at predetermined values.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">SP (standard precision)</span></dt>
<dd><p>
Standard-precision (SP) docking is appropriate for screening ligands of unknown
quality in large numbers.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">XP (extra precision)</span></dt>
<dd><p>
Extra-precision (XP) docking and scoring is a more powerful and discriminating
procedure, which takes longer to run than SP. XP is designed to be used
on ligand poses that have been determined to be high-scoring using SP docking.
We recommend that you run your database through
SP docking first, then take the top 10% to 30% of your final poses
and dock them using XP, so that you perform the more expensive
docking simulation on worthwhile poses.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> Extra precision mode can be used when the
active site of the complex contains a metal and often works
well but has not been optimized for such applications.
</p></dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<a name="feature2.2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Ligand sampling</span> option menu and options</dt>

<dd><p>The <span class="GUI">Ligand sampling</span> option menu allows you to
choose whether ligands are docked flexibly, rigidly, or not at all (score in
place). Extra options are available for flexible docking. </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#feature2.2.1"><span class="GUI">Flexible</span></a></li>
<li><a href="#feature2.2.3"><span class="GUI">Rigid</span></a></li>
<li><a href="#feature2.2.4"><span class="GUI">None (refine only)</span></a></li>
<li><a href="#feature2.2.5"><span class="GUI">None (score in place)</span></a></li>
</ul>

<dl>
<a name="feature2.2.1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Flexible</span></dt>
<dd>This is the default choice and directs Glide to generate conformations
internally during the docking process; this procedure is known as &quot;flexible
docking&quot;. At present, conformation generation is limited to variation
around acyclic torsion bonds, sampling of low-energy ring conformations, and
generation of pyramidalizations at certain trigonal nitrogen centers, e.g. in
sulfonamides. 
<p></p>
There are several options for conformation generation with this choice:<p></p>
<dl>
<dt><span class="GUI">Sample nitrogen inversions</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Sample inversions at pyramidal nitrogen atoms (not amides).
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Sample ring conformations</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Sample the conformations of rings. These conformations are not sampled 
in the main conformation generation, which focuses on sampling of rotatable
bonds, leaving the core fixed. This option is selected by default. Deselect this
option if you want rings to remain in their input conformations throughout
docking.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Include input ring conformation</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Select this option if you want to include the input conformations of
rings in addition to other conformations. This option is deselected by default,
and is only available if <span class="GUI">Sample ring conformations</span> is
selected.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Bias sampling of torsions for</span> options</dt>
<dd><p>Bias the sampling of torsions for groups that are expected to adopt a
particular conformation towards that conformation, by freezing angles, or
applying filters or penalties.  
</p>

<dl>
<dt><span class="GUI">Predefined functional groups</span></dt>
<dd><p>Apply torsion controls to direct a set of predefined functional
group torsions to adopt certain conformations. These functional groups and the
type of biasing are defined in a resource file (<code>torcontrol.txt</code>, in
<code>impact-v</code><i>version</i><code>/data</code>). 
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Amides bonds only</span></dt>
<dd><p>This option applies constraints or penalties to rotation around amide
C&ndash;N bonds.  The option menu provides a choice of the constraint type:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="GUI">Penalize non-planar conformation</span>&mdash;penalize
amide bonds that are not cis or trans (default)</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Retain original conformation</span>&mdash;
freeze amide bonds in their input conformation throughout docking</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Allow trans conformation only</span>&mdash;enforce
trans conformation within a small angle range (20&deg;)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">None</span></dt>
<dd><p>Do not penalize or constrain rotations about certain bond types, but
allow them to adopt a conformation according to the force field.
</p></dd>
</dl>

</dd>

</dl>
</dd>

<a name="feature2.2.3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Rigid</span></dt>
<dd><p>Rigid docking allows the existing ligand structure to be translated and
rigidly rotated relative to the receptor, but skips the conformation generation
step.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature2.2.4"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">None (refine only)</span></dt>
<dd><p>With this option, the input ligand structure does not pass through the
Glide docking procedure, but the input coordinates are used to perform an
optimization of the ligand structure in the field of the receptor, and then the
ligand is scored. For HTVS and SP, a minimization is performed; for XP, the
ligand is regrown in place. With XP mode, this option is not a substitute for a
full XP docking calculation. XP mode requires good initial poses.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature2.2.5"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">None (score in place only)</span></dt>
<dd><p>When this option is selected, Glide does no docking, but
rather uses the input ligand coordinates to position the ligands for
scoring.  This option is useful to score the reference ligand in its
cocrystallized or modeled position, or as a post-processing step on
Glide-generated poses to obtain individual components of the GlideScore
prediction of the binding affinity.</p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>: you cannot score in place a ligand that is currently defined in
Maestro as the reference ligand.
</p></dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<a name="feature2.3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Write XP descriptor information</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Write information on XP scoring terms to a file that can be read by the
<a href="xp_visualizer.html">Glide XP Visualizer</a>. This option is
available if <span class="GUI">XP</span> is selected under <span
class="GUI">Precision</span>. 
This option is not available with SD format for the output pose file.
</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> To generate XP descriptor information, you must have a license
for this feature.</p>
</dd>
<a name="feature2.4"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Add Epik state penalties to docking score</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>If the ligands have been prepared using Epik for ionization and
tautomerization, the Epik penalties for adopting higher-energy states
(including those where metals are present) are added to the docking score when
this option is selected. Ligands that do not have this information are not
penalized and will therefore have better scores, so you should ensure that the
ligand set is consistent.</p>
<p>If the ligand interacts with a metal (distance less than 3.0 Å), the metal
penalties that are computed when Epik is run with the metal binding option are
used. If multiple ligand atom-metal interactions are found, the smallest value
of the metal-specific penalty is used.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature2.5"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Enhance planarity of conjugated pi groups</span>
option</dt>
<dd><p>Increase the torsional potential around bonds between atoms whose
geometry should be planar (i.e. sp<sup>2</sup> atoms). This option should make
aromatic rings, amides, esters, and so on, less likely to adopt a nonplanar
geometry.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature2.6"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Apply excluded volumes penalties</span> option and
menu</dt>
<dd><p>If the grid has excluded volumes associated with it, select this option
to apply all the excluded volumes, and choose the penalty level from the option
menu. The penalty is applied if any ligand has atoms within the excluded volume.
The penalty ramps up from the boundary of the volume over a short distance to
the maximum penalty.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature2.7"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Show excluded volumes</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Display in the Workspace the excluded volume spheres that are associated
with the grid.
</p></dd>

</dl>

<a name="feature3"></a>
<h3>Advanced Settings button</h3>

<p>Click this button to open the
<a href="dock_settings_settings_db.html"><span class="GUI">Settings -
Advanced Settings</span> dialog box</a>.
The options in this dialog box define the manner in which Glide
processes the ligand <i>poses</i>
(combinations of position, orientation, and conformation) it generates.</p>
