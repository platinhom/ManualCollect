<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Use this panel to create a <i>trained</i> atom pair similarity model.  In the
standard AP similarity algorithm, all atom pair matches are weighted equally.  A
trained model applies different weights to different AP matches in a way that
maximizes similarity between actives and minimizes similarity between actives
and inactives.</p>


<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Create Similarity Model Panel</h2>

To open the <span class="GUI">Create Similarity Model</span> panel,
ensure that
<span class="GUI">Use trained similarity model</span> is selected in the
<span class="GUI">Similarity</span> tab of the
<span class="GUI">Ligand Docking</span> panel,
then click <span class="GUI">Create</span>. <p>

<a name="using"></a>
<h2>Using the Create Similarity Model Panel</h2>

<p>This panel allows you the option of biasing the similarity algorithm so that
not all AP matches are counted with equal weight.  You will need a file of
active ligands and a file of presumed inactive structures.  Glide will use these
sets of active and inactive ligands to determine which AP matches should count
more heavily in the trained model.</p>

<p>For example, if a group of actives have certain atom pairs in common, those
AP matches will be weighted higher than average. Atom pair matches that occur
between actives and inactives will be weighted lower.  By maximizing similarity
between actives while minimizing similarity between actives and inactives, the
trained model focuses on ligands that are more similar to actives and less
similar to inactives than in the standard (untrained) similarity model.</p>

<p>When you have specified the actives and inactives to use, click
<span class="GUI">Start</span> to open the <span class="GUI">Start</span>
dialog box. The default job name is <tt>glide_similarity</tt>. When you have
specified the job options, click <span class="GUI">Start</span> to launch the
job.</p>

<p>When the job finishes, the name of the model file that it generates appears
in the <span class="GUI">Model file</span> text box in the <span
class="GUI">Similarity</span> tab of the <span class="GUI">Ligand Docking</span>
panel.</p>

You need a file of known active ligands to use any form of
similarity in a docking job. The same file you specified
in the <span class="GUI">Similarity</span> tab
can also be used in this panel. The file must contain
<b>at least two</b> known active ligand structures.
Best results are obtained with at least 10, but more than
20 are unnecessary and may increase calculation time.
To take full advantage of the weighting algorithm,
include actives with a wide variety of structures.
</p></dd>

<dd><p>
Specify the actives file by typing the filename in the
<span class="GUI">File of actives</span> text box
or by clicking the <span class="GUI">Browse</span> button
to open a file selector and navigate to the file.
The file must be in Maestro, SD, or MOL2 format.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">
File of inactives</span> options</dt>
<dd><p>
To create a trained similarity model,
you also need a file of structures presumed to be
inactive. This may include untested compounds which
are very unlikely to be active.
</p></dd>

<dd><p>
The inactives file must contain <b>at least one</b>
ligand-like structure, but more will improve results.
Using 5 to 10 times the number of actives is optimal.
Typical numbers might be 15 structures in the
actives file and 150 structures in the inactives file.
If your inactives file is much larger than about 200
structures, or 10 times the number of actives,
using all the structures in the inactives file
can lead to convergence problems in the training algorithm.
To avoid this difficulty, use the remaining options in the panel
to specify that a random subset of inactives should be used.
</p>

<p>
Specify the inactives file by typing the filename in the
<span class="GUI">File of inactives</span> text box
or by clicking the <span class="GUI">Browse</span> button
to open a file selector and navigate to the file.
The file must be in Maestro, SD, or MOL2 format.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Use random set of
inactives</span> check box</dt>
<dd><p>
Select this option when the number of structures in your
inactives file is much greater than 10 times the number in
the actives file. Glide will choose a random subset from
the structures in the inactives file.
</p></dd>


<a name="feature4"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Approx. number to use</span>
text box</dt>
<dd><p>
When you instruct Glide to choose a random subset of the structures
in your inactives file, you must specify approximately how many
structures to include. Accept the default setting,
100 inactives, or type another number. Optimally,
the number of inactives should be 5 to 10 times the number of actives.
