<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>The <span class="GUI">Constraints</span> tab
of the <span class="GUI">Ligand Docking</span> panel
lists all the Glide constraints that are defined for the
receptor grid files you specified
in the <span class="GUI">Settings</span> tab, and
provides the means to selectively apply these constraints in docking.
</p>

<p>
The constraints can be set in groups, up to a maximum of four groups. Each
group of constraints is applied to the ligand (a Boolean AND is applied between
groups). Within each group, you can require all constraints to be satisfied, or
you can set a minimum number of constraints in the group that must be
satisfied. In this way you can define required or optional constraints within
each group. Overall, there must be 4 or fewer required constraints, across all
groups. </p>

<p>For example, suppose the grid contains a hydrogen bond constraint
<tt>hbond1</tt> and two hydrophobic constraints <tt>hphob1</tt> and
<tt>hphob2</tt>. If you want to enforce the hydrogen bond constraint, and
require only one of the two hydrophobic constraints, you would click the
<span class="GUI">Use</span> check box for
<tt>hbond1</tt> in Group 1 and select <span class="GUI">All</span>
under <span class="GUI">Must match</span>; and click the
<span class="GUI">Use</span> check boxes  for
<tt>hphob1</tt> and <tt>hphob2</tt> in Group 2, select
<span class="GUI">At least</span> under
<span class="GUI">Must match</span>, and enter <tt>1</tt> in the text
box. </p>

<p>The definition of a constraint includes the ligand feature to which it
matches. These features are defined in terms of SMARTS patterns. To edit the
ligand feature definitions, select the table row for the constraint and click
<span class="GUI">Edit Feature</span>.
The <a href="edit_feature.html"><span class="GUI">Edit
Feature</span> dialog box</a> opens, allowing you to select the feature type;
import or export feature sets; and add, edit or delete patterns. </p>

<p>To use a different combination of the available constraints,
run another docking job and select the desired constraints.</p>

<p>Glide constraints can be used only in flexible docking jobs.
(Ensure that <span class="GUI">Dock flexibly</span> is selected in the
<a href="dock_settings.html">Settings Tab</a>.)
Glide constraints can be used in HTVS mode, but may result in poor pose
recovery.<p>

<p><b>Note:</b> If you include positional constraints, you must define the
ligand feature that it should match. No default feature definition is provided,
and the job cannot be run until the feature is defined. To define the ligand
feature, select the appropriate row in the <span class="GUI">Available
constraints</span> table and click <span class="GUI">Edit
Feature</span>. The feature can then be defined in the
<a href="edit_feature.html"><span class="GUI">Edit
Feature</span> dialog box</a>.

<h2>Constraints Tab Features</h2>

<p>The <span class="GUI">Constraints</span> tab contains four
subtabs for defining constraint groups. Each subtab has the same
structure. </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#feature2"><span class="GUI">
Show markers</span> option</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature3"><span class="GUI">
Group</span> tabs</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature4"><span class="GUI">
Available constraints</span> table</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature5"><span class="GUI">
Edit Feature</span> button</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature6"><span class="GUI">
Must match</span> options</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature7"><span class="GUI">
Test constraint satisfaction only after docking</span> option</a></li>
</ul>

<a name="feature2"></a>
<h3>Show markers option</h3>
<p>
This option is selected by default. When the receptor is displayed,
atoms for which H-bond/metal constraints are defined
are marked with a red asterisk and padlock.
Regions for which hydrophobic constraints are defined are
marked with translucent gray hydrophobic cells.
Positional constraints are marked with gray translucent spheres.
When a constraint is selected, the padlock and asterisk turns blue,
and the cells or spheres are colored red.
To undisplay the markers, deselect this option.
</p>

<a name="feature3"></a>
<h3>Group tabs</h3>

<p>The constraints are presented in four tabs, labeled
<span class="GUI">Group 1</span> through
<span class="GUI">Group 4</span>. The number in parentheses after the
group name is the number of constraints that must be satisfied in this group,
and reflects the minimum number of constraints used. This value depends on the
selection made under <span class="GUI">Must match</span>.

<p>Each group has the full range of constraints available. You can select the
same constraint in two groups. </p>

<a name="feature4"></a>
<h3>Available constraints table</h3>

<p>This table lists the constraints that are available for use in the docking
job, and provides the means to select constraints for use. You can select a
single row in the table for various actions on the constraint. The table columns
are described below.</p>

<dl>
<dt><span class="GUI">Use</span></dt>
<dd><p>Check box to select the constraint for use in docking. Click to select or
deselect.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Name</span></dt>
<dd><p>Constraint name. This is the name defined in the
<a href="grid_constraints.html"><span class="GUI">Constraints</span> tab</a> of the
<span class="GUI">Receptor Grid Generation</span> panel.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Receptor Constraint Type</span></dt>
<dd><p>Type of receptor constraint. Hydrogen bond constraints are classified into
<span class="GUI">H-bond</span> for hydrogen-bond acceptors and
<span class="GUI">Polar Hydrogen</span> for hydrogen-bond donors
(i.e. hydrogen atoms). Note that the minimum donor and acceptor angles
(90 and 60 degrees) are smaller than those used by Maestro (120 and 90 degrees).
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Ligand Feature</span></dt>
<dd><p>Name of the feature type in the ligand that must match the constraint. The
available feature types are:
<span class="GUI">Acceptor</span>,
<span class="GUI">Charged Acceptor</span>,
<span class="GUI">Neutral Acceptor</span>,
<span class="GUI">Donor</span>,
<span class="GUI">Hydrophobic</span>, and
<span class="GUI">Custom</span>.</p>
<p>
By default, the feature type that matches a receptor polar hydrogen is set to
<span class="GUI">Acceptor</span>; for a receptor H-bond type it is
<span class="GUI">Donor</span>, for a receptor hydrophobic feature it is
<span class="GUI">Hydrophobic</span>, and for a positional constraint
it is <span class="GUI">Custom</span>.
<span class="GUI">Custom</span> is undefined by default, so you
must edit this feature to define the patterns that match the desired ligand atoms.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Number of Ligand Atoms</span></dt>
<dd><p>In this column, the number of ligand atoms that must occupy a hydrophobic
region can be set. The value is only meaningful for hydrophobic constraints.
</p></dd>

</dl>

<a name="feature5"></a>
<h3>Edit Feature button</h3>

<p>This button opens the  <a href="edit_feature.html"><span class="GUI">Edit
Feature</span> dialog box</a>, in which you can
select the feature type; import or export feature sets; and add, edit or delete
patterns. You must use this dialog box to provide feature definitions for positional
constraints.</p>

<a name="feature6"></a>
<h3>Must match options</h3>

<p>These options allow you to set the number of constraints in the group that must
be satisfied when docking ligands.</p>
<dl>
<dt><span class="GUI">All</span></dt>
<dd><p>All constraints that are selected (<span class="GUI">Use</span>
column checked) must be satisfied.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">At least</span></dt>
<dd><p>The number of constraints given in the text box must be satisfied. This
number must be less than the number selected (<span class="GUI">Use</span>
column checked).
</p></dd>

</dl>

<p>The total number of constraints that are required to match must be no more
than 4. This number is the sum of required constraints within each group. For
example, suppose Group 1 had two constraints selected for use, and both constraints
were required to match; Group 2 had three constraints selected for use, but only
one was required to match; and Group 3 and 4 had no constraints selected for use.
The total number of required constraints is three: two from Group 1 and one from Group 2.</p>

<p>The limit on the number of required constraints is enforced when you select
constraints.</p>


<a name="feature7"></a>
<h3>Test Constraint Satisfaction Only After Docking Option</h3>
<p>
Select this option to test whether poses satisfy constraints only after the
ligands have been docked. With this option, constraints are used as a
post-docking filter, rather than having any influence on the docking or
scoring. You can therefore compare results directly with an unconstrained
docking run.
