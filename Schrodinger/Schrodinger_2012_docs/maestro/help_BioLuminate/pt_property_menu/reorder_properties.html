<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>In this dialog box you can reorder the properties in the Project Table. Tools
are provided for manual reordering and for reordering by family or
alphabetically. You can reorder just the shown properties, or all
properties. You can also change which properties are shown in the Project Table
at the same time.

<a name="feature1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Properties</span> options and list</dt>
<dd><p>The <span class="GUI">Properties</span> list displays the properties in
the scrolling section of the Project Table that can be reordered manually. The
options above the list allow you to choose whether to list all properties (<span
class="GUI">All</span>) or only the properties that are shown in the Project
Table (<span class="GUI">Shown</span>). If you use the <a
href="#feature4">Show properties buttons</a>, then the list reflects the
use of these buttons to change which properties will be shown in the Project
Table when you click <span class="GUI">OK</span> rather than the properties that
are currently shown in the Project Table.  
</p>
<p>You can select multiple properties in the list with the usual shift-click and
control-click actions. When you have a selection in the list, you can drag the
selected properties to a new location in the list, or act on them with the
buttons that are described below.</p>
<p>If the selection is discontiguous when you move it to a new location, the
properties are moved so that they are contiguous in the new location.</p>
<p>If the selection range includes hidden properties, these properties are moved
if you select <span class="GUI">All</span> for the properties to list. In this
case, the hidden properties are set in italics. If you selected <span
class="GUI">Shown</span>, the hidden properties are treated as though they are
not selected, and so are not moved with the selected properties. </p>
<p>If hidden properties are not listed, properties are always moved to a point
above any hidden properties in the new location. 
</p></dd>

<a name="feature3"></a>
<dt>Buttons for moving properties</dt>
<dd><p>The four buttons to the right of the list allow you to move the selected
properties to the top or the bottom of the list, or to move them up or down by
one place. If the selection is discontiguous, the properties are first moved to
a contiguous block below the first selected property, then moved to the new
location. 
</p></dd>

<a name="feature4"></a>
<dt>Show properties buttons</dt>
<dd><p>These buttons can be used to change whether properties are shown or
hidden in the Project Table. The change in visibility is not made until you
click OK, but any changes affect the properties that are marked as hidden in the
<span class="GUI">Properties</span> list. 
</p>

<dl>

<dt><span class="GUI">Show Only</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Show only the properties that are selected in the list. 
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Show</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Show the hidden properties that are selected in the list.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Hide</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Hide the shown properties that are selected in the list.
</p></dd>

</dl>

</dd>

<a name="feature5"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Create Family</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Create a custom property family from the properties that are selected in
the list. Opens the <span class="GUI">Create Custom Property Family</span>
dialog box, in which you can name the new custom family.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature6"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Select</span> section</dt>
<dd><p>This section provides tools for selecting properties in the <span
class="GUI">Properties</span> list. 
</p>

<dl>

<dt><span class="GUI">All</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Select all properties in the list.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">None</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Clear the selection of properties, so that no properties are selected.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Invert</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Invert the selection of properties in the list: the selected properties
are deselected, and the unselected properties are selected.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Select by</span> options</dt>
<dd><p>Select properties on the basis of their family membership or by filtering
their names.
<ul>
<li><span class="GUI">Family</span>&mdash;Select the members of the property
family that you choose from the option menu.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Filter</span>&mdash;Select properties whose names match
the filter given in the text box. The filter can include wildcard characters:
* for any number of any character, ? for any single character, and square
brackets to enclose a choice of characters. There is an implicit * at the
beginning and end of the expression. The filter is case-insensitive.</li>
</ul>
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Add</span> and <span class="GUI">Replace</span> buttons</dt>
<dd><p>These buttons apply the selection made under <span class="GUI">Select
by</span> to the list.  <span class="GUI">Add</span> adds the selection to what
is already selected in the list; <span class="GUI">Replace</span> replaces the
selection in the list with the selection made under <span class="GUI">Select
by</span>.
</p></dd>

</dl>

</dd>

<a name="feature7"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Order all</span> option menu</dt>
<dd><p>Order all properties (shown and hidden) according to the option chosen
from the option menu. The choices are <span class="GUI">Alphabetically</span>,
<span class="GUI">By standard families</span>, <span class="GUI">By custom
families</span>, and <span class="GUI">By all families</span>.</p>
<p>When ordering by family, the families are ordered alphabetically for each
family type. Custom families are placed before standard families. If a property
belongs to more than one family, it is ordered according to the first family it
belongs to, and ignored for the other families. Within each family, the
properties are ordered according to their current order in the list. This allows
you to order the families, but not change the order within the family. 
Any properties that are  not in a family are effectively moved to the end, in
the current relative order.

<a name="feature8"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Apply</span> button</dt>

option menu.
