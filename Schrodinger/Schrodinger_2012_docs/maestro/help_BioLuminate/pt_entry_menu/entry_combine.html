<p>To create a new entry by merging existing entries, select the entries to be
merged and choose <span class="GUI">Entry &rarr; Merge</span>.  The merged entry
is added to the Project Table after the last selected entry (and inside the
entry group of the last selected entry, if it exists). The previously selected
entries, whose content was used to create the new entry, remain in the project.
The selected entries are added to to the new entry in the order in which they
appear in the Project Table. You can therefore control the order of addition by
moving the entries in the Project Table before merging them. The title of the
new entry is the title of the source entry closest to the top of the Project
Table.
</p>
<p>There is no panel or dialog box associated with this command. </p>
<p>An alternative way of creating a new entry from several existing entries is
to include them in the Workspace, then create an entry from the Workspace. The
order in which the entries appear in the new entry is the order in which they
were included in the Workspace.
</p>
<p>If you want to merge entries in the order of their entry IDs, use the Maestro
command <code>entrycombine order=entryid</code>.
