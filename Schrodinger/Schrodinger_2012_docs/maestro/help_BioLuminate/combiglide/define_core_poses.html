<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
In this step you define the core poses that will be used for the library
docking. These poses can be generated from a Glide XP docking run with molecules
that include the core, or from entries in the Project Table that are already
docked to the receptor.
</p>

<a name="working"></a>
<h2>Working in the Define Core Poses Step</h2>

<p>The core poses are defined by docking a small set of molecules to the receptor.
Because Glide constraints are not applied, this step also provides some means of
constraining the motion of the core molecule during docking.</p>

<p>If you want to dock a set of core-containing molecules to the receptor
without constraints, select <span class="GUI">Unconstrained within
bounding box</span> in the
<span class="GUI">Pose definition mode</span> section. Once the poses
are docked they are clustered, and the best pose from each
cluster is selected. This mode generally provides the best sampling of the
possible binding modes.
</p>

<p>The structures used to define the core poses can be smaller than the original
core molecule, and therefore they might bind to locations in the active site
that are not accessible to the original. Many of these poses could be unreasonable,
and would be eliminated during the library docking. Although you can't use Glide
constraints for the core docking, you can constrain the center-of-mass of the core
to a sphere, by selecting <span class="GUI">Spatially constrained center of
mass</span>. The center can be set by clicking <span class="GUI">Define</span>, and using the
picking tools in the <span class="GUI">Define Core Constraint</span>
dialog box to pick atoms whose centroid is used to define the sphere center. The
radius of the sphere is 1&nbsp;&Aring; by default, and can be set in the <span class="GUI">Define Core Constraint</span> dialog box.
</p>

<p>Another way of defining the poses of the core structure is to import
structures that are already docked to the receptor into the CombiGlide run,
and select <span class="GUI">Constrained by initial core
positions</span> in the <span class="GUI">CombiGlide docking mode</span>
section. These structures must contain the core (the part that is left when you
break the grow bonds and remove the side chains). To import the structures,
you add them to the Project Table, then click <span class="GUI">From
Project</span> and select the relevant entries.
The positions of the cores defined by these structures will be varied during
the library docking step, but the RMS deviation of the core atoms from the
defined pose is limited by the value specified in the <span class="GUI">Maximum RMSD of core</span> text box. </p>

<h3>CombiGlide Docking Mode Options</h3>

<p>These options allow you to choose how the core poses are defined.
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#feature1.1"><span class="GUI">Unconstrained within
bounding box</span> option</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature1.2"><span class="GUI">Spatially constrained
center-of-mass</span> option</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature1.3"><span class="GUI">Filter by
initial core positions</span> option</a></li>

</ul>

<p></p>

<dl>
<a name="feature1.1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Unconstrained within
bounding box</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Dock the core structures without any constraints other than that the structure
must remain within the bounding box. </p>
</dd>

<a name="feature1.2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Spatially constrained
center-of-mass</span> option.</dt>
<dd><p>Dock the core structures with the center-of-mass of the core constrained to a
sphere. To define the sphere, click <span class="GUI">Define</span>.
This button opens the <span class="GUI">Define Core Constraint</span> dialog
box, in which you can pick atoms to define the center of the sphere and set the
sphere radius. The sphere radius must not extend beyond the enclosing box of the grid.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature1.3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Filter by initial
core positions</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Use the positions of the supplied core structures to constrain the core poses.
The structures must be correctly aligned to the receptor.
</p>
</dd>

<a name="feature1.4"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Apply Glide core
constraints</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Use Glide core constraints to constrain motion of core.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature2"></a>
<h3>Display Receptor Option</h3>

<p>Displays the receptor used to define the grid that was selected in
the previous step. Select or deselect to display or undisplay the receptor.
</p>

<a name="feature6"></a>
<h3>Maximum RMSD of Core Text Box</h3>

<p>The <span class="GUI">Maximum RMSD of core</span> text box
specifies the maximum RMS deviation of the core atoms from their initial location
during docking. Core poses with higher RMSD are discarded.</p>

<a name="feature3"></a>
<h3>Core Structures Table</h3>

<p>Lists the structures that are used to define the core poses. The <span class="GUI">In</span> column  is used to include the molecule in the
Workspace, in the same way as in the Project Table.
The <span class="GUI">Title</span> column is the title of the
molecule, and is editable. You can select multiple rows in the table.
</p>

<a name="feature4"></a>
<h3>Delete button</h3>
<p>Deletes the selected core molecules from the table.
</p>

<a name="feature5"></a>
<h3>Add Buttons</h3>
<p> These buttons allow you to add structures to the <span class="GUI">Core Structures</span> table. </p>

<dl>

<dt><span class="GUI">From Project</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Opens an entry chooser so that you can import molecules for the core poses
from the Project Table. The entries must satisfy the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>They must contain only a single molecule</li>
<li>The molecule must be inside the grid enclosing box</li>
<li>The molecule must contain the core structure</li>
</ul>
<p>No checking is done for
duplicates, so you must ensure that you don't add the same structure more than once.
The structures are copied into the run, so that any changes in the
Project Table do not affect these structures.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">User-capped Core</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Adds the original molecule used to define the core (selected in the Define
Combinations step) to the table. Unavailable if the original core molecule is
already in the table.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Minimally Capped Core</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Adds the minimally capped core to the table. Unavailable if the
minimally capped core molecule is already in the table.
</p></dd>
