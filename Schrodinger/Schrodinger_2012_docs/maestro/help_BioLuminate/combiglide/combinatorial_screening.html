<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
Create a small combinatorial library of compounds that should have high activity
towards to a selected target. The library is screened, first by docking to the
target receptor and eliminating compounds that do not dock well, then by
analyzing the docked compounds to define a small reagent set that is likely to
have a large number of actives among the compounds that are generated.
</p>

<h2>Opening the Combinatorial Screening Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Combinatorial Screening</span> panel:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Tasks &rarr; Small Molecule Tasks &rarr; Docking &rarr;
Combinatorial Screening &rarr; Combinatorial Docking</span> in the main
window.</p></li>
</ul>

<a name="using"></a>
<h2>Using the Combinatorial Screening Panel</h2>

<p>Each set of data defined in this panel is called a <i>run</i>. The
data for each run is stored as a separate entity, which you can open from the
<span class="GUI">File</span> menu. You can also import runs from this menu.</p>

<p>The tasks involved in each step are summarized below. </p>

<h3>The Define Combinations Step</h3>

<p>In this step, you select the molecule that you want to use for generation of
a library and screening the library by docking it to a receptor. The library is
generated by replacing selected side chains in the molecule with other side
chains. These side chains are called <i>attachments</i>. For each attachment,
you identify the bond that defines where the substitution will take place, and
specify a reagent library that contains the side chains you want to
substitute. The bond is called the <i>grow bond</i>. The <i>core</i> of the
molecule is the part of the molecule that is left when you remove the
attachments.  The library must be prepared beforehand (using the
<a href="reagent_preparation.html"><span class="GUI">Reagent
Preparation</span> panel</a>.</p>

<p>Once you have selected a molecule and the attachment positions for the
reagents, you can proceed to the next step.

<h3>The Configure Docking Step</h3>

<p>The screening process uses Glide XP docking to filter out reagents that
produce molecules that do not score well. This step assumes that you have
already generated a Glide grid, using the
<a href="../glide/receptor_grid_generation.html"><span class="GUI">Receptor Grid
Generation</span> panel</a>. In this step, you set options for the docking of
the libraries to the receptor. As well as selecting a grid and making basic
settings as for a Glide run, you can specify the full range of Glide
constraints for the docked molecules. </p>

<p>After selecting a grid and setting any desired options, you can proceed to
the next step.</p>

<h3>The Define Core Poses Step</h3>

<p>In this step, you select the core structures that you want to use in
the docking step to define the core poses. These poses are generated by docking
the molecules that contain the core. The molecule can be the core molecule,
the <i>minimally capped core</i>, or some other molecule that you choose.
The minimally capped core is the core of the molecule with a minimal
attachment at each attachment position. In most cases, the minimal attachment is a
methyl group. You can constrain the core position to prevent it from moving to
regions of the receptor that would generate unacceptable binding modes.
</p>

<p>When you have selected or generated the core poses, you can proceed to the
next step.</p>

<h3>The Dock Library Step</h3>

<p>In this step you run the jobs that generate the combinatorial libraries and
run the docking jobs. The docking is performed in two passes. In the first pass,
each attachment from each reagent library is added in turn to the core, to produce
molecules with a single attachment and minimal capping groups at the remaining
attachment points. These molecules are docked using Glide XP docking. Reagents that
generate bad poses are eliminated. This pass can be run independently. </p>

<p>In the second pass, the poses with a single attachment are combined
intelligently to produce molecules that are likely to dock well. These
molecules have attachments from the reagent libraries at all attachment points.
This pass is the most time-consuming part.</p>

<p> Once you have docked the combinatorial library, you can proceed to the next
step. You can also export the results of either the single-position docking or
the combinatorial docking for further examination.</p>

<h3>The Analyze Library Step</h3>

<p>In this step, the number of reagents used at each position is reduced to a
small set by application of filtering and selection strategies. Filtering is
based on structural properties such as molecular weight and counts of structural
features, and on properties generated by QikProp. The selection strategies locate
the &quot;best&quot; reagents at each position, based on the GlideScore of each
of the docked structures. </p>

<h2>Combinatorial Screening Panel Features</h2>

<p>The <span class="GUI">Combinatorial Screening</span> panel is
wizard-like in design, with five steps. Each step occupies the center of the panel, and
consists of a title with a brief description of the step at the top, a set of
controls and tables for results, and a <span class="GUI">Back</span> and a
<span class="GUI">Next</span> button at the bottom. The features of each step are
described in detail in separate help topics - see the <a href="#CombiScreen5">Related
Topics</a> section below. </p>

<p>In addition to the step features, the panel contains a menu bar and an
job status button at the top,
and a step guide at the bottom above the <span class="GUI">Close</span> and
<span class="GUI">Help</span> buttons. These features are described below.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#feature1">The <span class="GUI">File</span> menu</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature3">The <span class="GUI">Step</span> menu</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature5">The job status button</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature6">The Guide</a></li>
</ul>

<a name="feature1"></a>
<h3>The File menu</h3>

<p>The <span class="GUI">File</span> menu allows you to work with the runs
that are available in the project. </p>

<table cellpadding=3>
<tr valign=baseline>
<td><span class="GUI">New</span></td>
<td>Create a new run</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=baseline>
<td><span class="GUI">Open</span></td>
<td>Open an existing run from the submenu. If there are more than 4 runs,
choose <span class="GUI">More</span> to open a dialog box and select a run.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=baseline>
<td><span class="GUI">Save&nbsp;As</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td>Save the current run with a new name</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=baseline>
<td><span class="GUI">Rename</span></td>
<td>Rename the current run</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=baseline>
<td><span class="GUI">Delete</span></td>
<td>Delete the current run</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=baseline>
<td><span class="GUI">Import</span></td>
<td>Import a combinatorial screening run that was initiated from the command
line. Prompts for a run name, then opens a directory selector, in which you can
navigate to the directory that contains the output files from the run, and
select the run. The panel is then positioned at the <span class="GUI">Dock 
Library</span> step, and you cannot go back to previous steps.</td>

<h3>The Step menu</h3>

<p>The <span class="GUI">Step</span> menu contains an item to display or
hide the Guide, and items for each of the steps. The current step is marked with
a red diamond. If the Guide is displayed, it is marked with a red square.
The items for the steps that are not available are dimmed. You can
go to any available step by choosing the corresponding menu item.
</p>

<a name="feature5"></a>
<h3>The job status button</h3>

<p>The pink job status button at the upper right of the panel turns
green and the icon spins when a job is running. When the job has finished, the
button turns pink and the icon turns to an exclamation point while the job is
incorporating, then returns to its original state when the incorporation has
finished. You can click the button to open the <a
href="../misc/monitor_panel.html"><span class="GUI">Monitor</span> panel</a> and
monitor the job. </p>

<a name="feature6"></a>
<h3>The Guide</h3>

<p>The Guide displays the steps in the model as a set of buttons linked by
lines. The buttons for the steps that are not available are dimmed. The current step
is highlighted with a white background. You can go to any available step by clicking
its button in the Guide. The Guide can be displayed or hidden from the <span class="GUI">Step</span> menu.
