<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
This panel displays plots of various analyses of the reagent side chains in
terms of chemical features and compares the distribution of these features in
the full library and the selected library.
</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Chemical Features Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Chemical Features</span> panel</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Click <span class="GUI">Chem Features</span> in the
<span class="GUI">Analyze Library</span> step of the
<span class="GUI">Combinatorial Screening</span> panel.</p></li>
</ul>

<a name="using"></a>
<h2>Using the Chemical Features Panel</h2>

<p>
The chemical features defined in CombiGlide are categories of functional groups
that have certain properties. These features are essentially equivalent to
pharmacophore features. There are six basic features, which are identified by a
single letter:</p>
<ul>
<li>A&mdash;Hydrogen-bond Acceptor</li>
<li>D&mdash;Hydrogen-bond Donor</li>
<li>H&mdash;Hydrophobe</li>
<li>N&mdash;Negative center</li>
<li>P&mdash;Positive center</li>
<li>R&mdash;Aromatic group</li>
</ul>

<p>Each side chain can be characterized by the presence of one or
more of these features, and assigned a &quot;type&quot;, denoted by a label
composed of the feature letters. For example, side chains of the type AHN would
contain at least one acceptor, one hydrophobe, and one negative center. The side
chains can then be analyzed in terms of the presence of multiple features.
</p>

<p>The displays in this panel show what types of side-chains tend to concentrate
at each position in the ligands that bind well to the receptor of interest, and
are intended to assist in the selection of reagents for a second-generation library.</p>

<a name="features"></a>
<h2>Chemical Features Panel Features</h2>

<p>The display in the center of the panel and the controls available depend on
the option selected at the top of the panel, and are described with the option.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#feature0"><span class="GUI">File</span> menu</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature1"><span class="GUI">Side Chain Features</span> option</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature2"><span class="GUI">Overall Type Selectivity</span> option</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature3"><span class="GUI">Type Preferences</span> option</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature4"><span class="GUI">Position</span> buttons</a></li>
</ul>

<a name="feature0"></a>
<h3>File Menu</h3>

<p>The File menu allows you to export the chemical feature information in either
graphical or text form. </p>

<p><span class="GUI">Save as Postscript</span> and <span
class="GUI">Save as Gif</span> save the plotting area of the panel
(i.e. excluding the borders, options and buttons) as an image in the relevant
format. Only the current display is saved: to save images for the other
positions they must be displayed first. </p>
<p><span class="GUI">Export to Spreadsheet</span> writes a CSV file that
contains the chemical feature data and the chemical feature type data. <span
class="GUI">Export Text File</span> generates a text file that contains the same
data and information on the library selection.
</p>

<a name="feature1"></a>
<h3>Side Chain Features Option</h3>

<p>When you select this option, the display shows a bar graph of the fraction of
side chains that have a particular feature against the feature, for a given
position. The position name is displayed above the graph. The <span
class="GUI">Previous Position</span> and <span class="GUI">Next Position</span>
buttons allow you to select the position that is used. Data for the input
reagent list are shown in red; data for the reagents in the selected library are
shown in blue. The &quot;error bars&quot; show a measure of the significance of
the deviation of the selected library values from the input reagent list
values. If the top of the blue bar is outside this range, the differences are
statistically significant, and it may be inferred that there is a preference or
an aversion for this feature at this position. </p>

<a name="feature2"></a>
<h3>Overall Type Selectivity</h3>

<p>When you select this option, a bar chart is displayed that shows a measure of
how selective the position is. More selective positions are ones where the
distribution of types in the selected library significantly differs from the
distribution in the input side-chain collection. A value of 1 indicates an
unselective position; the larger the value, the greater the
selectivity. Selective positions are positions in which it matters more what
kind of side chain is added at that position; unselective positions are
positions in which the nature of the side chain is relatively unimportant. Thus,
when designing a next-generation library, you will probably want to use more
reagents at the more selective positions.
</p>

<p>The usefulness of the selectivity analysis does depend on how diverse the
input collection is. A collection that is uniform in the features it contains
(only one type) cannot display selectivity.</p>

<p>You can switch to a view of the details on which the selectivity analysis was
based, by clicking <span class="GUI">Show Type Details</span>. The button
changes to <span class="GUI">Show Type Selectivity</span> so you can switch back
to the selectivity view. The details view shows the number of types represented
at each position in the input collection and the selected library, and an
effective number of types, which is an entropy-based measure that is like a
number of types corrected for the fact that not all types occur equally
frequently.</p>

<a name="feature3"></a>
<h3>Type Preferences</h3>
<p>When you select this option, a chart is displayed for a given position that
shows which types are represented in the input collection and in the selected
library, and what fraction of each type is present. There is one
&quot;table&quot; for each of the collections.  Each row represents a chemical
feature; each column represents a type. The width of the column corresponds to the
fraction of that type in the collection. A given cell in a column is colored if
the feature is represented in the type, and is left white if the feature is not
represented. The color legend for the features is given to the right of the chart.
</p>

<p>The types are in the same order in each table, and the boundaries between the
types in each table are connected by a line. The options at the bottom of the
panel allow you to order the types alphabetically, by the fraction of the type
in the input library, or by the fraction of the type in the selected library.</p>

<a name="feature4"></a>
<h3>Position Buttons</h3>

<p>The <span class="GUI">Previous Position</span> and <span class="GUI">Next
Position</span> buttons allow you to select the position that is used. </p>
