<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This panel is used to set application-wide preferences. These preferences are
preserved between Maestro sessions. Preferences are applied immediately, unless
otherwise noted in the panel.
</p>

<a name="section2"></a>
<h2>Opening the Preferences Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Preferences</span> panel, do one of the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Edit &rarr; Preferences &rarr; Program
Preferences</span> in the main window.
</p></li>
<li><p>Type <span class="Keys">Ctrl+,</span> (<span class="Keys">&#x2318;,</span>) in the main window.
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Table &rarr; Preferences</span> in the 
<span class="GUI">Project Table</span> panel.
</p></li>
<li><p>Click the <span class="GUI">Preferences</span> button in the <span
class="GUI">Manage Surfaces</span> panel. 
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The preferences panel is also opened at a particular tab by clicking the 
<span class="GUI">Preferences</span> button in a number of panels.
</p>

<a name="section3"></a> 
<h2>Using the Preferences Panel</h2> 

<p>Preferences are categorized into groups, and many of the groups are divided
into subgroups.  Several of the preferences are included in more than one
group or subgroup, to make them easier to find. The groups and subgroups are
listed in the tree structure on the right. To display the subgroups for a group,
click the turner to the right of the group name. To display the preferences in a
group or subgroup, click the group or subgroup name. 
</p>
<p>You can search for text in any of the preferences, tooltips,  preference
headings, or tree text. As you type text into tht <span
class="GUI">Search</span> text box, the tree is pruned to show only the parts
that contain the text, and the groups are opened so that you can see the
subgroups. To show the full tree again, click the clear button. 
</p>

<a name="section4"></a> 
<h2>Preferences Panel Features</h2> 

<p>The preferences panel has a tree view of the preference groups and subgroups
on the left in a scrolling pane. When a group or subgroup is selected, the
settings for the group or subgroup are displayed on the right. Some settings are
available in more than one subgroup. Below the tree is a search text field and
button for clearing the text field.

<a name="general_directories"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Directories</span> settings</dt>
<dd><p>The default I/O directory is Maestro's current working directory (cwd).
The current working directory on Linux is initially the directory from which
Maestro was launched; on Windows it is the <code>Schrodinger</code> folder in
your documents folder (<code>Documents</code> on Windows 7 and Vista, <span
class="GUI">My Documents</span> on XP); on Mac it is the
<code>Schrodinger</code> folder in your <code>Documents</code> folder. 
This remains the current working directory unless you change it in the <a
href="../project_menu/changedir_panel.html"><span class="GUI">Change
Directory</span> panel</a>, or by entering the <tt>changedirectory</tt> command
in the Command Input Area of the main window 
(aliases are <tt>cd</tt> or <tt>chdir</tt>).
For example, typing the following command in the Command Input Area:</p>
<pre>
cd /home/hercules
</pre>
<p>causes all file selectors to have their default directories updated to
<tt>/home/hercules</tt>.</p>

<dl>
<dt><span class="GUI">Default directory for job startup and file i/o</span>
options</dt>
<dd><p>These options determine which directory Maestro uses for
file input and output and for creating job files. This location
is called the job launch directory or the I/O directory. This setting
determines both the initial I/O location when Maestro starts running
and how Maestro changes its I/O directory while it is running.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Maestro's current working directory</span> option&mdash;
Maestro uses the startup directory as the default I/O directory.  Files 
are read from/written to this directory and jobs are started in this
directory. Whenever Maestro's current working directory changes, the I/O
directory is also changed. Jobs running with this setting are not lost if the
project is renamed.</p></li>

<li><p><span class="GUI">Parent of project directory</span>&mdash;Maestro uses
the project's parent directory as the default I/O directory. 
Since this directory is defined by its relationship to the currently open
project, opening a different project or closing a project (which puts one into a
scratch project) changes this directory. For zipped projects, the parent
directory is the directory that contains the <code>.prjzip</code> file, rather
than the temporary directory into which the zipped project is extracted.</p>
<p>
Jobs running with this setting are not lost if the project is renamed.</p></li>

<li><p><span class="GUI">Project directory</span>&mdash;Maestro uses the
directory of the currently open project as the I/O directory. Files are read
from and written to this directory. This directory changes when a new project is
loaded. Jobs running here are disconnected if the project is renamed.</p></li>

<li><p><span class="GUI">Project jobs directory</span>&mdash;Maestro uses the
project's <code>jobs</code> subdirectory as the I/O directory. This directory
changes when a new project is loaded or when a scratch project is opened. Files
are read from and written to this directory. Jobs running here are disconnected
if the project is renamed.</p></li> 

<li><p><span class="GUI">Other (specify below)</span>&mdash;Maestro uses the
directory you specify as the I/O directory. When using this option, you must
enter the desired directory name in the <span class="GUI">Directory</span> text
box.</p></li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Temporary project location</span> text box and <span
class="GUI">Browse</span> button </dt>
<dd><p>Specify the location for the storage of temporary (scratch) projects. You
can click <span class="GUI">Browse</span> to navigate to the desired location.
This directory should be large enough for your temporary projects, and for
efficiency should be on a local file system. This location will be used for
temporary projects the next time you start Maestro.</p>
<p>Two environment variables are used to determine a location for the scratch
project. If <code>SCHRODINGER_TEMP_PROJECT</code> is defined, the location it
specifies is used, and overrides the value set here. Otherwise if it is not
defined and a location is not set here, the location defined by <span
class="GUI">TMPDIR</span> is used. Failing any of these, the default is to use
the local application data directory, which on Linux is <span
class="GUI">$HOME/.schrodinger/tmp</span>, and on Windows is
<code>%LOCALAPPDATA%\Schrodinger\tmp</code>. If any of these directories is on
a file system with a limited amount of space, you should consider specifying
another location.

</p>
<dl>
<dt><span class="GUI">Options for saving project on close</span></dt>
<dd><p>There are three options in Maestro for saving the project state and
deleting unnecessary files when a project is closed. These settings govern what
sort of cleanup is performed on a project when it is closed from Maestro, in
order to conserve disk space and to prepare for later re-opening of the
project. The cleanup is performed as a background task, and a compressed
backup of the project is created after the project is closed, if requested,
rather than when it is opened. This helps to provide faster opening and closing
of projects in Maestro.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Fast close</span>&mdash;
No compression is performed on the project, which is stored as is. Opening and
closing the project is the fastest, because there is no compression or
uncompression required. Since there is no compressed state stored when you open
the project again, you cannot revert to the opening state. If you need a backup
copy, you can always take a snapshot (see
<a href="../project_menu/save_state.html">Save State</a>).
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Create internal backup</span>&mdash;
Compresses the current state of the project into a single file, but does not
delete the current state directories. With this option, projects are slower to
close, but it is faster to open projects and to do the cleanup on closed
projects. The main drawback of this option is the extra disk space consumed
by leaving the current state directories expanded on disk after the project
is closed as well as storing the compressed state.
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Shrink project</span>&mdash;
Compresses the current state of the project into a single file, then deletes the
current state directories. This option consumes considerably less disk space
while the project is closed, but requires extra time for deletion of the directories.
It also requires more time when the project is uncompressed on opening.

<dd><p>The use of united atom types can cause problems for users who do not want
implicit hydrogen atoms in their structures, such as Jaguar users. United atom
types with implicit hydrogens are assigned by default when hydrogens are deleted
from heavy atoms. If this option is cleared, united atom types are never
assigned when atoms and bonds are explicitly deleted, atoms are retyped, or
structures are drawn freehand. Instead, the atom types remain unchanged, or
explicit radical types are assigned if they are available. United atom types

atom types is applied, or when reading in a structure file (such as a PDB file)
that does not have explicit hydrogens present.</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Adjust bond lengths when atom type is changed</span></dt>

give a &quot;reasonable&quot; bond length. This behavior is undesirable if the
geometry is  already correct (such as from a crystal structure) and it is only
necessary to change the atom types. Clearing this option prevents the adjustment
of bond lengths.

<dt><span class="GUI">Adjust number of hydrogens following build operations</span></dt>

not always desirable, and can be prevented by clearing this option.</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Delete terminal atoms</span> </dt>
<dd><p>When deleting an atom, terminally attached atoms can be deleted or
retained.If this option is selected, they are deleted. For example, if you
delete the carbon atom of a methyl group, the hydrogen atoms attached to the
methyl group are also deleted if this option is selected. If you delete the
middle carbon atom in propane, the two hydrogens attached to this atom are
deleted, but the carbon atoms are not because they are not terminal atoms.

<dt><span class="GUI">Warn about use of unprepared proteins</span></dt>
<dd><p>Proteins that have been prepared by the Protein Preparation Wizard from
Suite 2012 on are marked with a Maestro property. When you start a job with a
protein that does not have this property, a dialog box is posted to warn you
that the protein does not appear to have been prepared. You can choose to
continue and mark the protein as prepared, or cancel the job. Proteins prepared
with the Protein Preparation Wizard in releases prior to Suite 2012 do not have
this property, and will be regarded as possibly unprepared.
</p>
<p>To prevent the display of this dialog box, deselect this option. Proteins
will then be accepted regardless of their preparation, but will not be marked as
prepared.

existing job files are overwritten. Deselect this option if you want to
overwrite files from existing jobs without displaying a warning. If the existing
job is still running, the files will not be overwritten, regardless of this
setting, and a warning is displayed.

<dt><span class="GUI">Always run driver on remote host</span></dt>
<dd><p>When running jobs on a remote host, run the driver for that job on the
remote host as well.  This option is useful if you are running on the Cloud, as
the driver must run on the remote host. Note that some jobs, such as Glide,
Prime MM-GBSA, and Induced Fit Docking, rely on the driver running locally and
using the local file system (<code>-LOCAL</code>) to ensure that jobs are
restartable. Running these jobs on the remote host will prevent restarting.

<dd><p>These settings determine which directory Maestro uses for
file input and output and for creating job files. This location
is called the job launch directory or the I/O directory. This setting
determines both the initial I/O location when Maestro starts running
and how Maestro changes its I/O directory while it is running. The default I/O
directory is Maestro's current working directory, which is initially the
directory from which Maestro is launched, on Linux, or Documents and Settings,
on Windows.

directory is also changed. Jobs running with this setting are not lost if the
project is renamed.</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Parent of project directory</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Maestro uses the project's parent directory as the default I/O directory.
Since this directory is defined by its relationship to the currently open

scratch project) changes this directory. Jobs running with this setting are not
lost if the project is renamed.</p></dd>
