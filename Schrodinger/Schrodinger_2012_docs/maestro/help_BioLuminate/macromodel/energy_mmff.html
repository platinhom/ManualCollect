<p>The MMFF and MMFFs force fields are all-atom models.
These fields are especially useful for biopolymers (peptides
and proteins). MMFF's solvation energies are reliable in
both water and chloroform. MMFF assigns constant dielectric
electrostatics (e = 1) by default. Extended nonbonded cutoff
distances should be used for high accuracy with polar molecules.
When a conformational search is being used as a precursor to a
JBW (IMPS) simulation, the same force-field (MMFF or MMFFs)
should be used in both.</p>

<p>The MMFF94 (or MMFF for short) force field was introduced by
Thomas A. Halgren (<i>J. Comput. Chem.</i><b>1996</b>, vol. 17, no. 5).
MMFF is an all-atom force field, with no lone pairs.  Thus, its
MacroModel "H-addition profile" is the same as those of AMBER94
and MM3. MMFF has been carefully parametrized for a wide variety
of organic functional groups and for proteins (see MMFF-I).
It should thus be well suited for drug-receptor studies. MMFF
charges (see MMFF-II) are derived in a manner suitable for use
with the GB/SA solvation model.</p>

<p>There are actually two MMFF force-fields implemented: MMFF
and MMFFs, where the "s" is for "static." MMFF gives slightly
pyramidal amide geometries and rather strongly pyramidal aniline,
nucleic-acid base, and other enamine nitrogens.  Experimental and
theoretical studies indicate that this reflects the true ground-
state geometry.</p>

<p>In contrast, MMFFs uses modified torsion and out-of-plane
bending parameters for these nitrogens, giving rise to planar or
nearly planar geometries. Such nitrogens appear planar in crystal
structures, due to time-averaging of the rapidly inverting
pyramidal geometries.</p>

<p>Regular MMFF likely is most useful for dynamics studies
(where actual time averaging yields planar average structures),
whereas the MMFFs is probably most useful for conformational
search and for minimizations that are to be compared with
crystallographic data. With the obvious exception of inversion
barriers, the two force fields give similar (and, when delocalized
trigonal nitrogens are not involved, identical) relative
conformational energies.</p>

<p>MMFF treats "protein metals" such as Zn<sup>+2</sup>, Cu<sup>+</sup>,
Cu<sup>+2</sup>, Fe<sup>+2</sup>, and Fe<sup>+3</sup>, as
well as an assortment of alkali and alkaline earth cations, via the
commonly used &quot;nonbonded&quot; model, which employs van der Waals and
electrostatic interactions between the ligand and metal atoms.
Covalent systems involving metals can be accommodated by means
of user-defined atom types and parameters.</p>

<p>The MacroModel (the computational component of MacroModel) implementation
of MMFF was developed in cooperation with Dr. Halgren. And unlike our other
force fields, the assignment of parameters to interactions (stretch, bend,
nonbonded, etc.) is handled by a server co-process, called
"mmff_setup," which was written by Dr. Halgren. But, as with
any other force-field, MMFF parameters can be printed to the
<code>.mmo</code> file using the Maestro <span class="GUI">Current Energy</span>
panel with complete listing (MacroModel "ELST 1") and displayed using the force field
viewer (see <span class="GUI">Force Field Viewer</span> on the <span
class="GUI">Tools</span> menu).</p>

<p>Communication between the server process and Maestro is
handled by an interface layer called the BMFF library. For details of
how BMFF works and for a discussion of how to add new or overriding
parameters to the MMFF force-field file (f10.fld), see Appendix 5
of the <a href="../../../macromodel/macromodel_reference_manual.pdf"
