The MM2* force field is a modification of MM2. MM2* includes partial
charge electrostatics, explicit parametrization of conjugated systems,
and extensive additional parameters. Although MM2* is the best general
force field for organic molecules, it has reduced accuracy with molecules
possessing multiple polar functional groups. In addition, solvation
energies are accurate only with nonpolar solvents (e.g. chloroform). <p>

MM2* is an all-atom model with lone pairs only on ether and
hydroxyl oxygens. MM2* assigns constant dielectric electrostatics
(e = 1) by default. <p>

N.L. Allinger's MM2 Force Field, (J .Am. Chem. Soc. 1977, 99, 8127)
is the basis for MM2*. The current parameter set is Allinger's
1987 MM2(87) version. The MacroModel (the computational component of MacroModel)
implementation of the MM2 field differs from authentic MM2 as follows: <p>

1. Electrostatics - whereas the authentic MM2 program
uses dipole/dipole electrostatic interactions, we use
partial atomic charges that are derived from the MM2
dipoles. The field is also set for a distance-dependent
dielectric to mimic polarization effects, but this can
be changed to a constant dielectric treatment using the
ELECT button. <p>

2. Conjugated Systems - Whereas MM2 uses a pi-electron
calculation to determine bond orders, we use specific
torsional force constants to reproduce known rotational
energies of conjugated systems (1,3-dienes, enones, etc). <p>

3. Out-of-plane Bending - To maintain the planarity of
sp2 atoms, MM2 uses an out-of-plane bending equation
that MacroModel approximates by an improper torsion.
The differences are insignificant except for highly
distorted sp2 systems. <p>

4. Finally, MacroModel uses a special set of
parameters for Lennard-Jones (10,12) hydrogen bonding
as used in AMBER. <p>

The MacroModel treatment of MM2 is fully equivalent
to the authentic field with the exception of the above, and
additional or justifiably modified parameters. Such new
parameters are listed in .mmo output files as 'A' or 'M'
parameters. FOR AUTHENTIC MM2 CALCULATIONS, USE THE MM2
PROGRAM WHICH IS AVAILABLE FROM THE QUANTUM CHEMISTRY
PROGRAM EXCHANGE. <p>

Any missing parameters will be listed in the MacroModel
job .log file calculations. Parameters for MacroModel MM2
calculations are taken from the file 'mm2.fld'. <p>
