<p>AMBER94 is the authentic AMBER 94 force field. It all-atom
model that uses no lone pairs. This field works well for
biopolymers (peptides, proteins and nucleic acids) but has
few parameters for organic molecules. The option for extended
nonbonded cutoff distances is recommended to obtain the highest
accuracy with polar molecules. AMBER assigns constant dielectric
electrostatics (e = 1) by default. Solvation energies of the AMBER
field are reliable in both water and chloroform.</p>

<p>This version of AMBER is based on the 1994 parameter set
of Kollman et al. (Cornell, W. D.; Cieplak, P.; Bayly, C. I.;
Gould, I. R.; Merz, K. M.; Ferguson, D. M.; Spellmeyer, D.
C.; Fox, T.; Caldwell, J. W.; Kollman, P. A. <i>J. Am. Chem.
Soc.</i> <b>1995</b>, 117, 5179.) What follows are some notes
regarding the MacroModel (the computational component of MacroModel)
implementation of this force field.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Unlike AMBER*, the new AMBER parameter set contains only
parameters for carbons with all attached hydrogens explicitly
represented.</p></li>

<li><p>AMBER94 is designed for use in condensed phases.
For this reason, it is recommended that the GB/SA solvation
model be used in conjunction with the AMBER94 parameter set.
The charge derivation method used in AMBER94 (RESP fitting to
HF/6-31G* wave functions) gives charges that perform well in
calculations of absolute solvation free energies of small
molecules (see the section &quot;Absolute Free Energies of
Hydration from the GB/SA model - Dependence on Partial
Charges&quot; in the MacroModel Technical Manual). We therefore
anticipate that the combination of the GB/SA model and the
AMBER94 parameters will be a powerful methodology for
simulations of biomolecules in solution.</p></li>

<li><p>Unlike AMBER*, AMBER94's parameters have not been extended
beyond those reported by Kollman et al. As a result AMBER94's
utility with organic functionalities is limited, and it is
recommended that it is used only with proteins and nucleic acids.</p></li>

<li><p>The MacroModel AMBER94 implementation uses the same van der
Waals parameters for all both amide and amine nitrogens.
Although the Kollman paper gives the two nitrogen types
different VDW parameters, we have continued to use the same
VDW parameter for both in order to maintain consistency with
the AMBER4.1 program.</p></li>

<li><p>Lone pairs are not used on sulfur (or any other) atoms in
AMBER94. Kollman et al. point out that neutral sulfur atoms
are rarely seen as hydrogen bond acceptors.</p></li>

<li><p>AMBER94 as implemented in MacroModel should give results very
close to those obtained with the AMBER 4.1 program suite.
There are, however, some areas where the results obtained
with the two programs may differ slightly. In MacroModel the
partial atomic charges are derived from bond dipoles, not
stored as absolute values as in AMBER4.1. The charges differ
in the fifth decimal place and this electrostatic energies
obtained with MacroModel will be slightly different to those
obtained with AMBER4.1. This difference is of the order of 1
kJ/mol for a large, highly charged structure such as
d(ATGC).d(TACG). Additionally, there may be some small
differences between the improper torsion energies calculated
with MacroModel and those calculated with AMBER4.1. These
arise because, for some generalized improper torsions, the
two programs can select different ways to measure the angle.
All other energy terms are calculated identically between the
two programs.</p></li>
