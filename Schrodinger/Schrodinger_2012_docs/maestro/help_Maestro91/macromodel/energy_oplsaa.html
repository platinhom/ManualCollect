<p>This force field, developed by Professor W. Jorgensen of Yale University,
is probably the best available for condensed-phase simulations of peptides.
All force-field equations are identical to those of authentic OPLS_2001.
This force field was previously termed OPLS-AA. The term OPLS-AA is also used to
denote a force field from this series.
See the <i>MacroModel User Manual</i> for references.</p>

<p>The MacroModel implementation has been validated by comparison
to BOSS OPLS-AA calculations for a wide variety of organic systems. Comparisons
to ab-initio calculations and experiment show that OPLS-AA reproduces
conformational energies well for systems for which it has been specifically
parametrized. Especially good results can be expected for proteins. With the
exception of improved charge, van der Waals and torsion parameters for sulfur in
thiols and thiol ethers, all
parameters are native OPLS-AA. The new thio parameters, which use appreciably
smaller charges on sulfur and which have been validated in liquid-phase simulations
on thiols and thiol ethers, significantly improve the conformational energetics
of CYS and MET residues in proteins. In collaboration with Professor
Jorgensen's laboratory, we are working to extend the parametrization to broader
classes of drug-like molecules.  The current release includes a number of
new, significant enhancements related to the OPLS-AA parameter set.</p>
