<p>
The OPLS* force field is a modification of the published OPLS (91)
force field. New torsional potentials and minimal additional
parameters have been added. This force field is useful for peptides
and simple organic molecules. Organics having highly interacting
functional groups or heterocycles are likely to need additional
parameters. Solvation energies in both water and chloroform are
reliable. <p>

OPLS* assigns constant dielectric electrostatics (e = 1)
by default. All modeling should be done with constant
dielectric electrostatics. This force field cannot be used with distance-
dependent electrostatics. Both the all-atom and united-atom models
of this field can be used with simple systems. However, sterically
hindered systems require the use of the all-atom model, and
and polar molecules demand extended nonbonded cutoff distances.
In either case, hydrogens should be used on SP2 carbons. No lone pairs
are used in the OPLS* force field.  <p>

The OPLS* force field is based on W.L. Jorgensen's OPLS
force field for peptides. OPLS* includes OPLS charges and
nonbonded potentials, in addition to AMBER bonded energy components,
as described by W.L. Jorgensen and J. Tirado-Rives
(J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988, 110, 1657). The water in the file
is TIP3P (Jorgensen, W. L.; et al. J. Chem. Phys. 1983,
79, 926).<p>

A dielectric constant (set in the <span class="GUI">Potential</span> tab
of the MacroModel panels) of 1.0 is recommended, along with use
of the extended distance nonbonded cutoff option. The OPLS*
field is an interesting alternative to AMBER, since it uses
no explicit hydrogen binding functions or van der Waals
parameters for hydrogens that are bound to heteroatoms.
Note, however, that OPLS* may produce conformational energy
differences that are substantially in error, since many of the
bonded parameters have been taken directly from AMBER, without
systematic adjustment to offset the OPLS nonbonded
parameters. While many of the parameters have been adjusted
to better reproduce conformational energy differences but it
is suggested that any such conformational calculations be checked
against AMBER or MM2.<p>

To the best of our knowledge, the MacroModel treatment of OPLS*
is fully equivalent to the authentic force
field with the exception of additional or justifiably modified
parameters.  Such new parameters are listed in <tt>.mmo</tt> output files
as 'A' or 'M' parameters. <p>

Any missing parameters are listed in the MacroModel
job <tt>.log</tt> file calculations.  Parameters for MacroModel OPLS
calculations are taken from the file <tt>oplsa.fld</tt>.<p>
