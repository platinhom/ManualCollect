<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The "Torsion Angle" panel is used to display all the torsion interactions for a
given calculation. </p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Torsion Angle Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Torsion Angle</span> panel,
click the <span class="GUI">Torsion Angle</span> button
in the <span class="GUI">Force Field Viewer</span> panel.
To open the <span class="GUI">Force Field Viewer</span> panel,
choose <span class="GUI">Force Field Viewer</span> from the
<span class="GUI">Tools</span> menu in the main window. </p>

<a name="using"></a>
<h2>Using the Torsion Panel</h2>
The Torsion Angle List, located on the left side of the "Torsion Angle" panel,
displays all the torsion interactions present the selected .mmo file in the
order they were read from the file. To select a particular torsion,
highlight it in the list by clicking on it with the left mouse button,
or pick the atoms defining it from the Workspace structure. The text boxes on
the panel will update to display data relevant to the selected torsion. <p>

<dt>Torsion Angle List:</dt>
<dd><p>All the torsions in a given .mmo file are displayed in the Torsion
Angle
List located on the left side of the "Torsion Angle" panel. The text box in
which the list appears is a read-only field. </p></dd>

<a name="feature2"></a>
<dt>Find by Picking:</dt>
<dd><p>To locate a particular torsion in the list, enable the "Find by
Picking"
toggle button and click on the four atoms in the structure that define the
torsion. Once the fourth atom has been picked (and assuming an entry for
the atoms can be found), the torsion corresponding to those four atoms
will be selected in the list. </p></dd>

<a name="feature3"></a>
<dt>Sort by Energy:</dt>
<dd><p>By default, the torsions that are displayed in the list appear in the
order in which they were read from the .mmo file. However, the list may be
sorted according to energy by enabling the "Sort By Energy" toggle button.
The torsion with the lowest (i.e. most negative) energy will then be
displayed at the beginning of the list and the one with the highest energy (i.e.
most positive) will be displayed at the end. </p></dd>

<a name="feature4"></a>
<dt>Show:</dt>
<dd><p>When Maestro first reads an .mmo file, all of the torsion interactions
are
displayed on the "Torsion Angle" panel. To limit the displayed torsions based on
quality, select the "High Quality," "Medium Quality," or "Low Quality"
menu option from the "Show:" menu. Limiting the display to only the low
quality parameters is a useful way to identify those that might be
generalized or that might not be suitable for calculations in which a
high degree of accuracy is desired. The "All Parameters" option redisplays
all torsions. </p></dd>

<a name="feature5"></a>
<dt>Show Force Field:</dt>
<dd><p>Clicking on the "Show Force Field" button opens the "FField" panel,
which displays the currently selected .mmo file in its entirety. When the
panel is opened, a text line will be selected. This line corresponds to
the torsion that is currently selected in the Torsion Angle List.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature6"></a>
<dt>Torsion Energy:</dt>
<dd><p>Torsions are defined by four sequentially bound atoms. The value that
appears in the "Torsion Energy:" text box is the contribution to the total
molecular mechanics energy arising from the currently selected torsion.
This value is obtained from a calculation involving the actual torsion
angle and various torsion parameters (V1, V2, V3, etc.). </p></dd>

<a name="feature7"></a>
<dt>Actual Angle:</dt>
<dd><p>There is no "ideal" angle for a torsion. The number in this field
displays
the torsion angle that corresponds to the energy, shown in the "Torsion
Energy:" text box, that was calculated using the "V" parameters. </p></dd>

<a name="feature8"></a>
<dt>V1:</dt>
<dd><p>This is the standard torsional parameter, which is used to calculate
the
energy for a particular improper torsion at 0 degrees, relative to that at
180. The parameter is useful in defining such energy differences as that
between cis and trans conformations. </p></dd>

<a name="feature9"></a>
<dt>V2 and V3:</dt>
<dd><p>These are the standard V2 and V3 torsional parameters. </p></dd>

<a name="feature10"></a>
<dt>V4, V5, and V6:</dt>
<dd><p>These parameters are similar to the "V1:"-"V3:" parameters described
above, but are typically used only for more complicated calculations.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature11"></a>
<dt>Off1 through Off6:</dt>
<dd><p>These values are angle off-sets that may be used in calculating a
torsion
energy. These values are usually set to zero as they are used primarily
for difficult-to-parametrize cases. </p></dd>

<a name="feature12"></a>
<dt>Origin:</dt>
<dd><p>The "Origin:" setting is meant to provide users with information
regarding
the actual parameter evaluation method used in the present calculation.
The possible entries in this field include "Original," "Modified
Parameter," and "Additional Parameter." "Original" means that the force
field used was in its native state, as published by the original author.
"Modified" implies that MacroModel used a version with parameters that have
been revised based on work by the MacroModel research group or subsequent
publications. Finally, the "Additional Parameter" message indicates that
MacroModel's force field treatment of this particular item involves at least
one parameter that was absent from the native force field. For more
information about which parameters have been modified or added, see the
help topic on a specific field in the list of related topics below. Also,
the source of the modifications/additions is listed on the first line of
each .mmo file. </p></dd>

<a name="feature13"></a>
<dt>Quality:</dt>
<dd><p>The designation that appears in this field refers to the confidence
level
for the currently selected measurement. Calculations using the original
force field parameters, or parameters that have otherwise been extensively
researched, are given "High Quality" ratings. Calculations that include
less certain parameters are given "Medium Quality" ratings. Calculations
using parameters that are applied generically, without consideration for
a particular bonding situation, are given "Low Quality" designations.
Those parameters that are given "Low Quality" ratings may not be
acceptable in calculations that require high accuracy. <p>

The "Quality" rating system is meant to be used only as a guide. Ratings
are somewhat relative. For instance, a parameter designated as "medium"
quality for a high-accuracy force field like MMFF might still produce more
reliable results than a "high" quality parameter in the MM2* field. Please
note that it is still possible to obtain inaccurate results from a
parameter with a "High Quality" rating. </p></dd>

<a name="feature14"></a>
<dt>Alternate:</dt>
<dd><p>For some force fields, it is possible for users to customize
particular
parameters. For instance, in the AMBER* field, either the
Senderowitz-Parish-Still or the Homans carbohydrate parameters can be
chosen. To select a treatment different than the default, you must edit
the force field file. The "Alternate:" text field in the "Force Field
Viewer" panels is meant only to notify you which, if any, modifications
were made to the force field before the calculation in the currently
selected file was performed. </p></dd>

<a name="feature15"></a>
<dt>Comment:</dt>
<dd><p>The text in this field is a description of the atom and bond
configuration for the currently selected torsion. </p></dd>
