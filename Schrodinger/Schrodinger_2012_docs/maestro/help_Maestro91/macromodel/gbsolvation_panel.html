<h2>Summary</h2>
The "GB Solvation" panel is used to display, for each atom, the
Generalized Born (GB) component of the GB/SA calculation. <p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the GB Solvation Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">GB Solvation</span> panel,
click the <span class="GUI">GB Solvation</span> button in the
<a href="../tools_menu/ffview_panel.html">Force Field Viewer Panel</a>. </p>

<a name="using"></a>
<h2>Using the GB Solvation Panel</h2>
The Solvated Atom List on the left side of the "GB Solvation" panel
displays all the solvated atoms present the selected .mmo file in the order
they were read from the file. To select a particular atom, highlight it in
the list by clicking on it with the left mouse button, or pick it from the
Workspace structure. The text boxes on the panel will update to display data
relevant to the selected atom. <p>

<dl>
<a name="feature1"></a>
<dt>Solvated Atom List:</dt>
<dd><p>All the solvated atoms in a given .mmo file are displayed in the
Solvated
Atom List located on the left side of the "GB Solvation" panel. The text
box in which the list appears is a read-only field. </p></dd>

<a name="feature2"></a>
<dt>Find by Picking:</dt>
<dd><p>To find a particular atom in the list, enable the "Find by Picking"
toggle
button and click on the solvated atom on the structure. Once the atom has
been picked (and assuming an entry for it can be found), the corresponding
atom will be selected in the Solvated Atom List. </p></dd>

<a name="feature3"></a>
<dt>Sort by Energy:</dt>
<dd><p>By default, the atoms whose numbers are displayed in the Solvated
Atoms
List appear in the order they were read from the .mmo file. However, the
list can be sorted according to energy by enabling the "Sort By Energy"
toggle button. The atom with the lowest (i.e. most negative) energy will
then be displayed at the beginning of the list and the atom with the highest
energy (i.e. most positive) will be displayed at the end. </p></dd>

<a name="feature4"></a>
<dt>Show Force Field:</dt>
<dd><p>Clicking on the "Show Force Field" button opens the "FField" panel,
which displays the .mmo file in its entirety. The line that is selected
in the force field file display corresponds to the atom that is currently
selected in the Solvated Atom List. </p></dd>

<a name="feature5"></a>
<dt>Energy:</dt>
<dd><p>The numeric value displayed in this text field represents the
solvation
energy of the currently selected atom as calculated by the Generalized
Born portion of the GB/SA model. The GB term in the GB/SA treatment
accounts for the solvate-solvent electrostatic interactions. </p></dd>

<a name="feature6"></a>
<dt>Volume:</dt>
<dd><p>The number in the "Volume:" field can generally be thought of as the
volume of a sphere calculated using the Born Radius of the selected atom.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature7"></a>
<dt>Radius:</dt>
<dd><p>The value that appears in the "Radius:" text box is the radius of the
atom. Note that this value may be different than that used to calculate
the solvent-accessible surface area, since the latter may be increased to
include attached hydrogens. </p></dd>

<a name="feature8"></a>
<dt>Born Radius:</dt>
<dd><p>The Born radius of an atom is essentially an effective radius that is
based on the distance of an atom from the solvent front. An atom's
contribution to the molecular solvation energy is inversely proportional
to this radius. That is, atoms that are buried, and therefore screened
from the solvent, make smaller contributions to the GB solvation energy.
