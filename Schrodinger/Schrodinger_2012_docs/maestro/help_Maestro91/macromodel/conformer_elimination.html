<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The <span class="GUI">Redundant Conformer Elimination</span> panel is used
to eliminate conformers that are identical after either a conformational search
or the minimization of a set of conformers. The elimination is based upon distances
between atoms and energies. The energies used may be from a previous MacroModel or
Jaguar calculation. </p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Redundant Conformer Elimination Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Redundant Conformer Elimination</span>
 panel:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Applications &rarr; MacroModel &rarr; Redundant
Conformer Elimination</span>.</p></li>
</ul>

<a name="using"></a>
<h2>Using the Redundant Conformer Elimination Panel</h2>
<p>MacroModel panels allow you to choose structures from either the Workspace or the
Project Table (see <a href="energy_overview.html">Energy Overview</a>
for details).  In the center of the <span class="GUI">Redundant Conformer Elimination</span>
panel you can set up the atoms to be used in structural comparison and set other criteria
for comparison or elimination of atoms. Once you have finished configuring the settings
on the panel, you can click <a href="../misc/job_start_db.html">
<span class="GUI">Start</span></a> to start the job
or click <span class="GUI">Write</span> to write the files without starting the
job (see <a href="energy_overview.html">Energy Overview</a> for details). </p>


<p>Structural comparisons can be performed &quot;in place&quot;, that is, with no
translation or rotation of the structures. This option is useful if the
molecules have been positioned with respect to some kind of external potential
such as that of a receptor. The comparison can also eliminate or retain
mirror images of each structure.</p>

<p>In addition to the comparison of the geometries of the conformers, you can
choose to include the energy as a criterion for comparison. The energy
is used to pre-screen the structures for equivalence. If the energies of two
structures are within 1&nbsp;kJ/mol, the structures could be equivalent, and the
structural comparison is done to check whether they are indeed equivalent.  This
option provides a very rapid screening of structures for equivalence. You can
use energies from Jaguar as well as from MacroModel for the comparison
criterion.</p>

<a name="feature1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Comparison atoms</span> controls</dt>
<dd><p>Define the atoms that are equivalent in each structure. These are the atoms
that are used for the comparison that determines which structures are
conformers. You can define the comparison atoms using the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Standard <a href="../misc/picking_controls.html">picking controls</a></li>
<li>The <a href="../misc/asd.html"><span class="GUI">Atom Selection</span> dialog box</a></li>
<li>Predefined sets of atoms (heavy atoms are non-hydrogen atoms):</li>
<ul><li><span class="GUI">Heavy Atoms + O-H, S-H</span></li>
<li><span class="GUI">Heavy Atoms</span><br /></li>
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>The atom pairs are listed in the text area. If you want to delete a pair, select
the pair in the list and click <span class="GUI">Delete</span>. To delete all
pairs, click <span class="GUI">Delete All</span>.</p> </dd>

<a name="feature2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Eliminate redundant conformers using</span> options and
<span class="GUI">Cutoff</span> text boxes</dt> 
<dd><p>Select the distance mesasure for determining whether structures should be
considered equivalent:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Maximum atom deviation</span>&mdash;consider structures
to be different if the maximum atom deviation for any pair of corresponding
atoms exceeds the threshold given in the <span class="GUI">Cutoff</span> text
box.
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">RMSD</span>&mdash;consider structures to be different
if the RMS deviation for all compared atoms exceeds the threshold given in the
<span class="GUI">Cutoff</span> text box. 
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The default cutoff is 0.5&nbsp;&Aring; for both options.</p></dd>

<a name="feature3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Compare structures 'in place'
(no superposition)</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Select this option to compare the structures in
their given locations: the conformers are not superimposed (translated
and rotated to obtain the closest alignment of atoms) during the comparison process.
By default, the structures <i>are</i> superimposed.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature4"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Retain mirror-image conformations</span> option</dt>

<dd><p>By default, both a structure and its mirror image are considered when comparing
with the other structures. If one of the two matches, the structure is
eliminated. To ensure that both the structure and its mirror image are kept,
select this option.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature5"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Source of energy</span> option menu</dt>
<dd><p>Choose an energy to include it as a criterion for comparison of the structures or choose
<span class="GUI">None</span> to disable the energy comparison. Structures whose
energy differs by more than 1&nbsp;kJ/mol are considered
inequivalent. This test is applied before the geometries are compared.
You can choose from the Jaguar energy or the energies for various force fields
supplied with MacroModel. If the particular energy you selected is not
available among the properties of the structure, the calculation stops.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature6"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Energy window for saving
structures</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>Specify the threshold value for comparison of structures. Structures are kept only if
their energy is less than this value above the current global minimum. Lowering
this value results in fewer structures saved. The default is 50&nbsp;kJ/mol.  </p></dd>
