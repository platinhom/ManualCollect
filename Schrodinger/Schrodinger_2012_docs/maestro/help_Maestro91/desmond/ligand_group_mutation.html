<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>In this panel, you can set up and run FEP calculations for the mutation of a
ligand functional group. The panel is designed to make setting up FEP jobs as
easy as possible: most of the computational details, such as setting the force
field parameters, solvation, relaxation of the system, and setting the FEP
simulations, are taken care of automatically.
</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Ligand Functional Group Mutation by FEP Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Ligand Functional Group Mutation by FEP</span>
panel:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Applications &rarr; Desmond &rarr; 
Ligand Functional Group Mutation by FEP</span>.</p></li>
</ul>

<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Ligand Functional Group Mutation by FEP Panel</h2> 

<p>In ligand mutation, a group on the ligand molecule, called the <i>substitution
group</i>, is replaced with selected fragments. FEP simulations are
automatically prepared, performed, and analyzed to yield the free energy
difference between the mutant and the original ligand molecule for 
each fragment.</p> 

<p><span class="HB">To run a ligand mutation job:</span></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Include in the Maestro Workspace the system that contains the ligand to be
mutated, the receptor protein (optional), and any other key molecules of the
system.</p>
<p>You can use an existing model system that may, for example, include a
membrane. If you do, note that the SPC water model is used in the FEP
simulations, regardless of the choice made for your model system. This step can
be performed prior to opening the panel.</p></li>  

<li><p>Select <span class="GUI">Pick the attachment bond</span>, then pick the
attachment bond in the Workspace, at the end toward the substitution group.
</p>
<p>This bond is the bond at which the substitution will take place. 
When the bond is picked, a green arrow is drawn over the bond, pointing to the
substitution group, and the ligand core is colored with green carbons. If you
clicked on the wrong end of the bond, click again.</p>
</li>

<li><p>In the <span class="GUI">Fragment library</span> table, select the
fragments that you want to use to replace the original substitution group by
selecting their table rows. Use shift-click and control-click to select multiple
table rows.</p>
<p>You can view the mutated ligand by clicking in the <span
class="GUI">View</span> column.</p>

<li><p>(Optional) Display the mutated ligand and adjust the geometry of the
fragment.</p>
<p>It is possible that the fragment may have clashes with the protein in its
default orientation. Adjusting the fragment will reduce the amount of
minimization required prior to the FEP calculation, because the adjusted
geometry is used as the starting point in the FEP simulations. 
</p>
<p>Once the fragment is displayed, you can use the 
<a href="../tool_bar/adjust.html">adjustment tools</a> or the
<a href="../tool_bar/local_transformations.html">local transformation tools</a>
to adjust the fragment geometry. To reset to the original geometry, click the
button in the <span class="GUI">Reset</span> column.</p></li>

<li><p>In the <span class="GUI">Plan Calculation</span> tab, select the 
calculation types.</p>
<p>The choices will depend on whether you want to calculate relative binding free
energies (complex and solvent) or relative solvation free energies (solvent and
vacuum). 
</p></li>

<li><p>Choose the FEP protocol you want to use for each calculation type
from the <span class="GUI">FEP protocol</span> option menu.</p></li>  

<li><p>Set the buffer size for the periodic box. The buffer size is ignored if
you use a prepared model system as input.
</p></li>

<li><p>Set the time used for the actual simulation (following any initial
simulation) at each lambda point. 
</p></li>

<li><p>Set the temperature for the simulation.
</p></li>

<li><p>Click <span class="GUI">Start</span>, set the job parameters in the 
<span class="GUI">Start</span> dialog box, and click <span
class="GUI">Start</span> in the dialog box to run the job.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Ligand Functional Group Mutation by FEP Panel Features</h2> 

<p>This panel has two tabs and a set of action buttons. 
The <span class="GUI">Define Perturbation</span> tab and the action buttons are
described below. The <span class="GUI">Plan Calculation</span> tab is described
in a separate topic, as its contents are common to several FEP calculation
panels.
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#feature1"><span class="GUI">Define Perturbation</span> tab</a></li>
<li><a href="plan_calculation_tab.html"><span class="GUI">Plan Calculation</span> tab</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature2">Action buttons</a></li>
</ul>

<a name="feature1"></a>
<h3>Define Perturbation tab</h3>
<p>This tab displays a series of steps to follow. Each step has text describing
the task for the step. </p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> involves displaying the ligand, the receptor, and any other
important molecules in the Workspace.
</p>
<p><b>Step 2</b> involves picking the attachment bond for the functional group
substitution. It has a single option, <span class="GUI">Pick the attachment
bond</span>. When this option is selected, you can pick a bond on the ligand in
the Workspace. When the bond is picked, a green arrow is drawn over the bond,
pointing to the substitution group, and the ligand is colored with green
carbons. You therefore should click on the bond nearest to the substitution
group. If you click on the wrong end, you can click again to rectify the error.
Once focus is returned to the panel, this option is deselected. 
</p>

<p><b>Step 3</b> involves selecting the fragments that will replace the
substitution group. This step is performed using the <span class="GUI">Fragment 
library</span> table. The fragments that will be used are the fragments that you
select in the table. To view the ligand with a particular fragment replacing the
substitution group, click in the <span class="GUI">View</span> column.</p>
<p>If you want to reorient the fragment, you can do so with the
<a href="../tool_bar/adjust.html">adjustment tools</a>, which are
available from the <span class="GUI">Adjust</span>
button on the <a href="../tool_bar/toolbars.html#edit"><span
class="GUI">Edit</span> toolbar</a>: </p>
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/adjust.png">
<p>or with the <a href="../tool_bar/local_transformations.html">local
transformation tools</a>, which are available from the <span
class="GUI">Transform</span> button on the <a
href="../tool_bar/toolbars.html#edit"><span class="GUI">Edit</span> toolbar</a>:
</p>
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/globallocal.png">
<p>The reoriented fragment will be used in the FEP. You can revert to the
original fragment by clicking the button in the <span class="GUI">Reset</span>
column. You should not make modifications to the ligand core or other molecules
in the system. 
</p>

<a name="feature2"></a>
<h3>Action buttons</h3>
<p>At the bottom left of the panel are three buttons that perform various
actions:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Start</span>&mdash;Opens the 
<span class="GUI">Start</span> dialog box, in which you can set the job
parameters such as job name, host, number of CPUs, and so on, and then start the
job.
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Write</span>&mdash;Writes the input files for the job
but does not start the job. Opens a dialog box in which you can specify a job
name, which is used to name the files. This capability is useful if you want to
change the FEP protocol. 
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Reset</span>&mdash;Resets the entire panel to its
initial state. This includes clearing the Workspace. If you want to use the same
structures, you will have to redisplay them befor proceeding.
</p></li>
</ul>
