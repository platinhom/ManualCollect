<p>Note: Confgen is a separately-licensed product, distributed along with
MacroModel.</p>

<p>The following features have been added for the Suite 2012 release of ConfGen
2.3:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Two options have been added that reproduce the conformations generated by
Phase. The <span class="GUI">Phase fast search without minimization</span>
option runs the default conformational search used in database generation. This
option is supported from the command line by the <code>-PHASE_FAST</code> option
to the <code>confgen</code> command. 
The <span class="GUI">Phase high quality search with minimization</span>
reproduces the default conformational search run in the <span
class="GUI">Develop Common Pharmacophore Hypotheses</span> workflow. This option
is supported from the command line by the <code>-PHASE_QUALITY</code> option to
the <code>confgen</code> command.
</p></li> 

<li><p>Command options for the Chen and Foloppe model (<code>-FAST_CF</code>)
and the enhanced planarity parameters (<code>-FORCE_PLANAR</code>) have been
added to the <span class="GUI">confgen</span> command.
</p></li> 

</ul>

<p>The following features were added for the Suite 2011 release of ConfGen
2.3:</p>
<ul>

<li><p>Considerable improvements have been made in ring templating:
<ul>
<li>Custom location for additional templates</li>
<li>More templates, including macrocycles</li>
<li>Amide bonds can be mapped to double-bonded templates</li>
</ul>
</p>
</li>

<li><p>The <span class="GUI">Enhance planarity of conjugated pi groups</span>
option has been added in both the <span class="GUI">ConfGen Standard</span> and
the <span class="GUI">ConfGen Advanced</span> panels.  This option promotes
planar geometry for bonded sp<sup>2</sup> atoms by increasing the torsional
potential around the bond. It is supported from the command line by the 
<code>-FORCE_PLANAR</code> option to the <code>confgen</code> command.
</p></li> 

<li><p>The default conformation for esters has been set to trans, to avoid
generating cis conformations when the trans conformation has bad contacts in the
initial sampling. 
</p></li> 

<li><p>The OPLS_2005 force field is used by default, which allows a greater
range of elements an parameters (e.g. including B and Si). 
</p></li>

<li><p>An option to reward hydrogen bonds that complete 5- or 6-membered
pseudo-rings has been added.
</p></li>

<li><p>More efficient distributed processing is available with the
<code>confgen</code> command.
</p></li>

<li><p>A fast mode has been added that is based on the work described in
I-J. Chen and N. Foloppe, <i>J. Chem. Inf. Model.</i> <b>2010</b>, <i>50</i>,
822. This mode is included in the <span class="GUI">Confgen Advanced</span>
panel as <span class="GUI">Fast (CF)</span>, and is supported by the
<code>-FAST_CF</code> option to the <span class="GUI">confgen</span> command.
</p></li>

</ul>
