<ul>

<h4>Workspace and Toolbars</h4>

<li><p>The <span class="GUI">Save Image</span> panel is now a file selector with
options for the image included in the panel.
</p></li> 

<li><p>Ribbon quality can be reduced when moving the ribbon, by setting a <a
href="../maestro_menu/preferences.html#representation_ribbons">preference</a>.  
</p></li> 

<li><p>The <a href="../workspace_menu/atom_bond_color.html"><span
class="GUI">Atom and Bond Coloring</span> panel</a> has been redesigned to
simplify it. The <span class="GUI">Color Scheme</span> tab is now a separate
panel, and the controls to apply a color scheme are now in the <span
class="GUI">Atom Color</span> tab. The color selection tabs have been removed.
Atom colors are set by opening a standard color selector; bond colors are still
set with the palette, which you open by clicking the color button in the 
<span class="GUI">Bond Color</span> tab.
</p></li> 

<li><p>The <a href="../workspace_menu/atom_labels.html"><span class="GUI">Atom
Labels</span> panel</a> has been redesigned.
</p></li> 

<li><p>The fields in atom labels can be reordered, by dragging them in the
<span class="GUI">Fields</span> list. (Update 2)
</p></li> 

<li><p>The <a href="../workspace_menu/display_atom.html"><span
class="GUI">Display/Undisplay Atoms</span> panel</a> has been
redesigned. (Update 2)
</p></li> 

<li><p>The <span class="GUI">Molecular Representation</span> panel has been
redesigned. All of the settings are now in the <a
href="../maestro_menu/preferences.html# representation"><span
class="GUI">Preferences</span> panel</a>, and the panel itself is only for
applying a representation to atoms or bonds. Ribbons can now be applied from a
new <a href="../workspace_menu/ribbons.html"><span class="GUI">Ribbons</span>
panel</a>, and the <span class="GUI">Ribbon Options</span> dialog box has been
removed, as all the settings are now in the <span class="GUI">Preferences</span>
panel. (Update 2)
</p></li> 

<li><p>Measurement labels and atom labels can be dragged in the Workspace to
reposition them. For atom labels, you can restore the default positions of all
labels.
</p></li> 

<li><p>When selecting captions or highlights, you can add to the selection with
shift-click. 
</p></li> 

<li><p>Several new <a href="../misc/keys.html#maestro_shortcut">keyboard
shortcuts</a> have been introduced, for translation and rotation. These are
implemented along with menu items on the <span class="GUI">View</span> menu.
</p></li> 

<li><p>Toolbar buttons have been added for increasing and decreasing Workspace
fonts. 
</p></li> 

<li><p>A preference has been added to enhance fog when fitting to the Workspace.
</p></li> 

<li><p>The <span class="GUI">Fog</span> subtab in the <span
class="GUI">3D</span> tab of the <span class="GUI">Appearance</span> panel has
been moved up to become a tab in the panel itself.
</p></li> 

<li><p>Clipping planes can be adjusted to fit the selection, the ligand, or all
atoms without doing zoom, from the <span class="GUI">View &rarr; Move Clipping
Planes</span> submenu. 
</p></li> 

<li><p>Stereo images can be swapped in the <span class="GUI">3D</span> tab of
the <span class="GUI">Appearance</span> panel. This is useful for resolving
synchronization issues with hardware stereo. 
</p></li> 

<li><p>Perspective is enabled by default. (Update 2)
</p></li> 


<h4>Menu Bar</h4>

<li><p>Some of the <span class="GUI">Maestro</span> menu items have been moved
to other menus. 
</p></li> 

<li><p>The <span class="GUI">View</span> menu now has <span
class="GUI">Rotate</span> and <span class="GUI">Translate</span> submenus, which
offer rotation and translation by small increments, as well as the 90 degree
rotations available previously. In addition, there is a <span
class="GUI">Transform Mode</span> submenu, which allows you to select a mode in
which the &quot;normal&quot; mouse action (left mouse button) is used for
rotation, translation, or zoom, and picking is suspended. 
</p></li> 

<h4>Projects and Project Table</h4>

<li><p>The capability for automatic backups of projects has been added. Settings
for backups can be made in a new <span class="GUI">Backups</span> section in the 
<a href="../maestro_menu/preferences.html#project_backups"><span
class="GUI">Preferences</span> panel</a>. (Update 2) 
</p></li> 

<li><p>The main toolbar has been split into two toolbars, the 
<a href="../project_facility/project_toolbar.html"><span
class="GUI">Project</span> toolbar</a> and the  
<a href="../project_facility/property_toolbar.html"><span
class="GUI">Property</span> toolbar</a>, with a number of new buttons.  
</p></li> 

<li><p>Properties for each product (or &quot;author&quot;) have been classified
into &quot;primary&quot; and &quot;secondary&quot; properties. These
classifications can be used to restrict what is shown in the Project Table and
in property selectors. 
</p></li> 

<li><p>The <span class="GUI">Sort Project Table</span> panel has been
redesigned, to support group sorting, grouping of entries before sorting, and
selection of entries after sorting, as well as unlimited sort keys. The <span
class="GUI">Sort Groups</span> panel has been removed.
</p></li> 


<li><p>The colors and shading of the rows in the Project Table, and columns in
the fixed area, can be set as preferences. 
</p></li> 

<li><p>Numbers are now right-aligned, and text is left-aligned, subject to a
preference.
</p></li> 

<li><p>A preference for showing the <span class="GUI">Stars</span> column in new
projects was added. 
</p></li> 

<li><p>The number of chiral centers in a ligand-sized molecule can be
calculated in the <a href="../pt_property_menu/calcprop_panel.html"><span
class="GUI">Calculate Properties</span> panel</a>, and chirality properties
added to the chiral atoms.
</p></li> 

<li><p>More control over the recording of a movie has been added. You can
specify the frame duration or the length of the movie in the 
<a href="../project_facility/movie_options.html"><span class="GUI">Movie -
Options</span> dialog box</a>, and you can choose to interpolate between frames
to create a smoother movie.
</p></li> 

<h4>Atom Selection</h4>

<li><p>The atom selection tools that are available in panels where picking is
done have been redesigned, to provide more options and to simplify the tools.
See the <a href="../misc/picking_controls.html">Picking Controls</a> topic for a
description. (Update 2)
</p></li> 

<li><p>In the <span class="GUI">Sets</span> panel, you can apply a chosen set to
select atoms in the Workspace. (Update 2)
</p></li> 

<h4>Building</h4>

<li><p>In the 2D Sketcher, you can add or replace functional groups by typing in
a standard name or a SMARTS pattern. 
</p></li>




<h4>Import and Export</h4>

<li><p>A <span class="GUI">Common</span> file type has been added in the Import
panel that shows Maestro, PDB, and SD files. 
</p></li> 

<li><p>Compressed SMILES files, with the extension <code>.smigz</code> or
<code>.smi.gz</code>, can be imported. 
</p></li> 

<li><p>Compressed PDB files (<code>.pdb.gz</code>) can be imported and exported.
(Update 2)
</p></li> 

<li><p>When writing PDB files, you can select an option to reorder the atoms by
increasing residue number, so that atoms for each residue are contiguous. 
(Update 2)
</p></li> 

<h4>Jobs and Monitoring</h4>

<li><p>An option has been added to the <span class="GUI">Create
Postmortem</span> dialog box to alter path names to make them unrecognizable. 
</p></li> 

<li><p>An <span class="GUI">Incorporate All</span> button has been added to the
<span class="GUI">Monitor</span> panel so that you can incorporate all completed
jobs in the current project in one action. (Update 2) 
</p></li> 


<h4>Surfaces</h4>

<li><p>Electrostatic potential surfaces can be created, using the partial
charges of the entry, in the <span class="GUI">Electrostatic Potential
Surfaces</span> panel. 
</p></li> 

<li><p>Darkening colors by cavity depth can be applied to individual surfaces
via an <a href="../surfaces/surfaces_display_options.html#feature4">option</a>
in the <span class="GUI">Surface Display Options</span> dialog box, as well as
being set as a global preference.
</p></li>

<li><p>An outline (&quot;contour&quot;) can be added to the edges of surfaces
when the edge is more than a given distance in front of the rest of the
surface, to make the closer part of the surface stand out. 
</p></li> 

<li><p>Angle-dependent transparency can be applied to a surface, in which the
transparency depends on the surface normal: maximum when the normal is
perpendicular to the screen, minimum when it is parallel to the screen.
</p></li> 

<li><p>Surfaces can be colored by the color of the nearest alpha carbon
atom. (Update 2)
</p></li> 

<li><p>To display or undisplay a particular surface, you can use middle-click in
the Surface table.
</p></li> 

<li><p>A preference has been added to set the default surface style.
</p></li> 

<li><p>A preference has been added to open the <span class="GUI">Manage
Surfaces</span> panel when surfaces are created. (Update 2)
</p></li> 

<li><p>A <span class="GUI">Preferences</span> button has been added to the <span 
class="GUI">Manage Surfaces</span> panel, which opens the <span
class="GUI">Preferences</span> panel at the preferences for surfaces.
</p></li> 

<h4>Preferences and Customization</h4>

<li><p>A <a href="../maestro_menu/preferences.html#search"><span
class="GUI">Search</span> text box</a> has been added, which you can 
use to search for text in the panel (including tooltips).
</p></li> 

<li><p>The alignment of numbers and text (left, center, right) in the Project
Table is controlled by a 
<a href="../maestro_menu/preferences.html#project_table_properties">preference</a>.
</p></li> 

<li><p>A <a href="../maestro_menu/preferences.html#project_table_properties">

<a href="../maestro_menu/preferences.html#measurements">preference</a>.
</p></li> 

<li><p>The colors and shading of the rows in the Project Table, and columns in
the fixed area, can be set as <a href="../maestro_menu/preferences.html#project_table_colors">preferences</a>. 
</p></li> 

<li><p>Padding can be added to Project Table columns when fitting to data, by
setting a <a href="../maestro_menu/preferences.html#project_table_properties">preference</a>. 
</p></li> 

<li><p>The settings from the <span class="GUI">Molecular Representation</span>
panel have been moved to the 
<a href="../maestro_menu/preferences.html# representation"><span
class="GUI">Preferences</span> panel</a>. (Update 2)
</p></li> 

<li><p>Ribbon options are now in a <a
href="../maestro_menu/preferences.html#representation_ribbons">new section</a>
in the <span class="GUI">Preferences</span> panel.
</p></li>

<li><p>Ribbon quality can be reduced when moving the ribbon, by setting a <a
href="../maestro_menu/preferences.html#representation_ribbons">preference</a>.  
</p></li> 

<li><p>Reapplication of the Workspace Style when the Workspace changes can be
turned off when a project is closed, by setting a 
<a href="../maestro_menu/preferences.html#project_closing">preference</a>.
</p></li>

<li><p>A 
<a href="../maestro_menu/preferences.html#workspace_fitting">preference</a> has
been added to enhance fog when fitting to the Workspace. 
</p></li> 

<li><p>Thick lines can be used for tubes instead of wire frame when using a
simplified representation during rotation and translation, by setting a 
<a href="../maestro_menu/preferences.html#representation_quality">preference</a>
</p></li> 

<li><p>A <a href="../maestro_menu/preferences.html#surfaces_appearance">
preference</a> has been added to set the default surface style.

of mouse customizations in the <span class="GUI">Customize Mouse Actions</span>
panel. 
</p></li> 

<li><p>A preference has been added for showing the index of the object being
picked in the Workspace when the picking cursor is over an atom. The index is
shown at the beginning of the status bar. This allows you to see the molecule
number or entry number when picking. 
</p></li>


<h4>Tools</h4>

<li><p>The <span class="GUI">Protein Structure Alignment</span> panel has been
updated. It now provides a choice of the reference residues and the residues in
the proteins that are to be aligned to the reference. It runs the <span
class="GUI">structalign</span> utility directly, which uses the optimized
alignment. The option for this feature and the <span class="GUI">Options</span>
button have therefore been removed. You can also force an alignment for low
similarity with a new option.
</p></li> 

<p>The background of measurement markers can be set with a preference.
</p> 

<li><p>The <a href="../tools_menu/measurements_panel.html"><span
class="GUI">Measurements</span> panel</a> has been redesigned. Picking to delete 
measurements is no longer available, as you can do this in the table. The colors
of the markers are now set in the <span class="GUI">Measurements</span> section
of the <span class="GUI">Preferences</span> panel, and a <span
class="GUI">Preferences</span> button has been added to open the <span
class="GUI">Preferences</span> panel at this section. (Update 2)
</p></li>

<li><p>For distance measurements, an <span class="GUI">Atoms &amp;
Surfaces</span> item has been added to the <span class="GUI">Pick</span> menu in
the <span class="GUI">Distances</span> tab of the<span
class="GUI">Measurements</span> panel, which allows you to pick atoms or
surfaces. The <span class="GUI">Atoms</span> item is now strictly for picking
atoms.
</p></li> 

<li><p>The <span class="GUI">H-Bonds</span> and <span
class="GUI">Contacts</span> tabs in the <span class="GUI">Measurements</span>
panel have been moved into a separate 
<a href="../tools_menu/hbonds_contacts.html"><span class="GUI">H-Bonds and
Contacts</span> panel</a>. The colors and cutoffs can be set in a new <span
class="GUI">H-bonds and contacts</span> section of the <span
class="GUI">Preferences</span> panel, and  a <span
class="GUI">Preferences</span> button has been added to open the <span 
class="GUI">Preferences</span> panel at this section. (Update 2)
</p></li>
 
<li><p>1-4 interactions can be excluded from consideration as contacts by
setting an option in the <span class="GUI">Contacts</span> tab of the <span
class="GUI">H-Bonds and Contacts</span> panel. (Update 2)
</p></li> 

<li><p>A <span class="GUI">Workspace selection</span> section has been added to
the <span class="GUI">Sets</span> panel. This section contains three buttons,
<span class="GUI">Replace</span>, <span class="GUI">Add</span>, and <span
class="GUI">Subtract</span>, for replacing the Workspace selection with the
atoms that match the set, adding these atoms to the Workspace selection, or
removing these atoms from the Workspace selection. (Update 2)
</p></li> 


<h4>Help Facility</h4>

<li><p>Tutorials can be set up in the <a
href="../help_menu/set_up_tutorial.html"><span class="GUI">Tutorials</span>
panel</a>, which you open from the <span class="GUI">Help</span> menu.
</p></li>
<li><p>Due to updates in the generation of the PDF documentation, the default
PDF reader has been changed on Linux to kpdf. This is because Adobe Reader on
Linux does not handle links to other PDF files consistently with the newer PDF
files.
</p></li> 

<h4>Other New Features and Changes</h4>

<li><p>Maestro preference sets can be saved in named profiles. Six profiles are
provided by default; the three main profiles are for standard Maestro,
BioLuminate, and Maestro Elements. Three other profiles customize Maestro as it
appeared in Maestro 9.1, provide a somewhat easier interface for first-time
users, and provide an interface that focuses on small molecule tools,
particularly QM tools. 
</p></li>


<li><p>The <span class="GUI">Hetatom</span> tab has been removed from the <span
class="GUI">Atom Labels</span> panel.</p></li> 

<li><p>A utility has been added for validating Maestro files, named
<code>maevalidate</code>.
</p></li>
