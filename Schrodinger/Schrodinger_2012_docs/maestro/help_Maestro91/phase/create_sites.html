<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>In the <span class="GUI">Create Sites</span> step, you can modify the
pharmacophore features used to define the model or add new features, and then
you create pharmacophore sites (labeled 3D location) for the features in each
conformer of each ligand. </p>

<a name="working"></a>
<h2>Working in the Create Sites Step</h2>

<p>The basic task of this step is to create pharmacophore sites for the
ligands you selected to develop a pharmacophore model. Phase supplies a
set of six built-in features: </p>
<ul>
<li>Hydrogen bond acceptor (A)</li>
<li>Hydrogen bond donor (D)</li>
<li>Hydrophobic group (H)</li>
<li>Negatively charged group (N)</li>
<li>Positively charged group (P)</li>
<li>Aromatic ring (R)</li>
</ul>

<p>To use these features, you can click <span class="GUI">Create
Sites</span> and continue to the next step when the job is finished. </p>

<p>If you want to supplement the built-in features, you can add SMARTS patterns
to define new groups that contribute to a feature, ignore patterns in the
built-in feature definitions, or mark patterns that define groups that are to be
excluded from the feature. To make these modifications, click <span
class="GUI">Edit Features</span>, and make the changes in the <a
href="edit_features.html"><span class="GUI">Edit Features</span> dialog
box</a>. This dialog box also allows you to view the individual patterns for the
displayed ligands. </p>

<p>You can also view the features in the Workspace for any of the ligands in the
<span class="GUI">Ligands</span> table. To do this, click the diamond in the
<span class="GUI">In</span> column for the ligand, select
<span class="GUI">Mark selected features</span>, and select the features
you want to display from the list below. The appearance of the features is
described in the <a href="#feature6"><span class="GUI">Mark selected
features</span> option and list</a> section below.</p>

<p>If you know that certain features on one or more of the active ligands cannot
contribute to a pharmacophore model, you can mark these features as excluded,
and they will not be used in the search for common pharmacophores. To do this,
place the ligand in the Workspace, and select the features to exclude, either by
selecting the relevant rows in the <span class="GUI">Excluded features</span>
list or by picking the features in the Workspace. (Repeated picks select and
deselect the feature). You can include more than one ligand in the Workspace, to
pick features for multiple ligands at the same time. This might be useful if the
ligands are aligned and have the same feature that should be excluded. The
ligands are identified in the <span class="GUI">Excluded features</span> list by
their row number from the <span class="GUI">Ligands</span> table.
</p>

<p>In addition to the main tasks in this step, you can also perform tasks from
the Prepare Ligands step: assign the ligands to a pharm set either manually or
by activity value, group the actives or require matches to certain actives.  
See the <a href="prepare_ligands.html"><span class="GUI">Prepare Ligands
Step</span></a> topic for more information.

<h2>Create Sites Step Features</h2>

<p>The controls and features of the <span class="GUI">Create Sites</span> step
are described here.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#feature1"><span class="GUI">Edit Features</span> button</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature3"><span class="GUI">Create Sites</span> button</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature5"><span class="GUI">Ligands</span> table</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature6"><span class="GUI">Show markers for selected features</span>
option and list</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature7"><span class="GUI">Excluded features</span> list</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature4"><span class="GUI">Activity Thresholds</span> button</a></li>
</ul>

<a name="feature1"></a>
<h3>Edit Features button</h3>

<p>This button opens the
<a href="edit_features.html"><span class="GUI">Edit
Features</span> dialog box</a>, in which you can define your own features,
or modify the standard features. </p>

<a name="feature3"></a>
<h3>Create Sites Button</h3>

<p>This button runs the job to create pharmacophore sites for all conformers of
all ligands. If the sites already exist for a conformer set, a link is made to
this set instead of running the job.</p>

<a name="feature5"></a>
<h3>Ligands Table</h3>

<p>The <span class="GUI">Ligands</span> table is similar to the table in
the <span class="GUI">Prepare Ligands</span> step. The first four columns
are the same, and have the same behavior; the selection behavior of the rows is
the same, and the right-click menu is the same.
See the <a href="prepare_ligands.html#feature3">Phase &mdash; Prepare Ligands
Step</a> topic for more information. </p>

<p>In place of the <span class="GUI">Conformations</span> column is a
series of columns, one for each pharmacophore feature, with the single-letter
designation of the feature in the column header. These columns are
populated with feature counts (the number of times a feature is present in a
ligand). </p>

<a name="feature6"></a>
<h3>Show Markers For Selected Features Option and List</h3>

<p>This option displays the selected features on the ligands that are included
in the Workspace. You can select multiple features from the list. The default
features are displayed as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Acceptor (A): Light red sphere centered on the atom with the lone
pair, with arrows pointing in the direction of the lone pairs </li>
<li>Donor (D): Light blue sphere centered on the H atom, with an arrow pointing
in the direction of the potential H-bond. </li>
<li>Hydrophobic (H): Green sphere</li>
<li>Negative (N): Red sphere</li>
<li>Positive (P): Blue sphere</li>
<li>Aromatic Ring (R): Orange torus in the plane of the ring</li>
<li>Custom features: Colored sphere, with a unique color. Sphere includes arrows
if the feature is a vector feature.</li>
</ul>

<a name="feature4"></a>
<h3>Excluded Features List</h3>

<p>This is a list of the features for the ligands that are included in the
Workspace. The feature is represented by the row number in the <span
class="GUI">Ligands</span> table and the feature identifier (type and index). It
is populated when you include ligands in the Workspace. Selecting features in
this list, or picking them in the Workspace, excludes them from consideration in
the search for common pharmacophores. The feature labels in the Workspace for
excluded features are colored red.
</p>

<a name="feature4"></a>
<h3>Activity Thresholds Button</h3>

<p>The <span class="GUI">Activity Thresholds</span> button opens the
<span class="GUI">Activity Thresholds</span> dialog box, in
which you can set a cutoff value for the active and the inactive ligands.
Ligands with activity greater than the active threshold are included in the
active set; ligands with activity less than the inactive threshold are included
in the inactive set; ligands with activity between the thresholds are included
in neither set (no set membership). This is the same dialog box as opened in
the <span class="GUI">Prepare Ligands</span> step.</p>
