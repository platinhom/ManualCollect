<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
In the <span class="GUI">Score Actives</span> dialog box, you can adjust
thresholds for keeping hypotheses during the scoring and adjust the hypothesis survival
scoring function.
</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Score Actives Dialog Box</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Score Actives</span> dialog box:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Click <span class="GUI">Score Actives</span> in the <span
class="GUI">Score Hypotheses</span> step of the <span class="GUI">Build
Common Pharmacophore Hypotheses</span> panel. </p></li>
</ul>

<li><a href="#feature2"><span class="GUI">Survival score formula</span> section</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Vector and Site Filtering Section</h3>

<p>In this section, you can set the thresholds for filtering out hypotheses with low
alignment and vector scores, limit the number of hypotheses returned, and set
tolerances for matching features.
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#feature1.1">Alignment filters</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature1.2">Numerical filters</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature1.3">Feature matching tolerances</a></li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<dl>

<a name="feature1.1"></a>
<dt>Alignment filters</dt>
<dd><p>The site alignment and vector scores are used to filter the hypotheses. You
can set the following thresholds for the filtering:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><span class="GUI">Keep those with RMSD below</span> <i>threshold</i>
<span class="GUI">&Aring;</span></dt>
<dd><p>Specify the threshold for RMS deviation of the intersite distances of any
contributing ligand from those of the reference ligand.
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Keep those with vector scores above</span> <i>threshold</i></dt>
<dd><p>Specify the threshold for the variation in the alignment of vectors between
any contributing ligand and the reference ligand. The maximum is 1.0, the
minimum is -1.0 (which would perform no filtering on vector alignment).
</p></dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<a name="feature1.2"></a>
<dt>Numerical filters</dt>
<dd><p>These filters keep hypotheses based on their score.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><span class="GUI">Keep the top</span> <i>n</i> <span class="GUI">%</span></dt>
<dd><p>Limit on the percentage of hypotheses to keep, according to their survival score.
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Keep at least</span> <i>n</i> <span class="GUI">and at
most</span> <i>m</i></dt>
<dd><p>Lower and upper limits for the number of hypotheses to keep, in order of
combined alignment score. If the percentage of hypotheses kept is lower or
higher than these limits, these limits override the percentage limit.
</p></dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<a name="feature1.3"></a>
<dt>Feature matching tolerances</dt>
<dd><p>In addition to using the RMSD to filter matches, you can set matching
tolerances on individual features. Features are considered to match if the site
points are within the specified tolerance. This feature is useful if the RMSD
matching is satisfied, but one or more features does not match well enough. </p>
<dl>
<dt><span class="GUI">Use feature matching tolerances</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>If selected, matching of individual features will be used in filtering.
</p></dd>
<dt>Feature table</dt>
<dd><p>This table lists all features (whether or not they are in the hypotheses) by
their single-letter type. To set a tolerance for a feature, edit the table cell in the
<span class="GUI">Tolerance</span> column. All tolerances are
applied: if you want to disable matching for a particular feature, set the
tolerance to a large value.
</p></dd>
</dl>
</dd>

</dl>

<a name="feature2"></a>
<h3>Survival Score Formula Section</h3>

<p>This section defines the survival score of the hypotheses, which is reported in the
<span class="GUI">Hypotheses</span> table of the <span class="GUI">Score
Hypotheses</span> step along with the individual scores that make up the survival score.
The possible range for each score is given below.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><span class="GUI">vector score</span></dt>
<dd><p>Possible range is from the cutoff specified in the
<span class="GUI">Vector and site filtering</span> section to 1.0
(perfect alignment).
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">site score</span></dt>
<dd><p>Possible range is 0.0 (alignment at RMSD threshold) to 1.0 (perfect alignment).
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">volume score</span></dt>
<dd><p>Possible range is 0.0 (no volume overlap) to 1.0 (perfect volume overlap).
This score is only included when its check box is selected.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">reference ligand relative conformational energy</span></dt>
<dd><p>Possible range is 0.0 upward. 0.0 means that the reference ligand is the
lowest-energy conformation. The energy is given in kcal/mol. The default
coefficient is zero. This score is only included when the volume score is also
included. 
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">selectivity score</span></dt>
<dd><p>Possible range is from 0.0 upward. A score of 2.0 means 1 in 100 molecules
would match. Selectivity score is excluded by default because it might eliminate
useful hypotheses. This score is only included when its check box is selected.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">number of matches</span></dt>
<dd><p>Possible range is 0 to the number of ligands in the active set. The
contribution to the score is the value in the text box raised to the power of
the number of matches minus 1. A value of 1.0 does not discriminate on the basis
of number of matches. Useful when the required minimum number of actives is
smaller than the total number of actives. Use with caution: even a value of 2.0
can give large variations in survival scores.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">reference ligand activity</span></dt>
<dd><p>The range of ligand activities in the entire ligand set is indicated in
the panel text. The default coefficient is zero.
</p></dd>
