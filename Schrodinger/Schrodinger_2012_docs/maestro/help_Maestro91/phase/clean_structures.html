<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>The <span class="GUI">Clean Structures</span> dialog box
sets up a LigPrep job that performs a number of tasks to clean up and prepare
ligand structures for use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Convert structures from 2D to 3D</li>
<li>Add hydrogen atoms to ensure that the structure is an all-atom structure</li>
<li>Remove counter ions and water molecules</li>
<li>Add or remove protons to produce the most probable ionization state at the
target pH (optional)</li>
<li>Generate stereoisomers (optional)</li>
<li>Remove "bad" structures</li>
<li>Perform an energy minimization (geometry optimization)</li>
</ul>

<p>The options available in the  <span class="GUI">Clean Structures</span>
dialog box are limited. If you need more flexibility, you can run LigPrep
directly, from the <a href="../ligprep/ligprep.html">LigPrep Panel</a>
For more detailed information about the process, see the <i>LigPrep User Manual</i>.
</p>

<h2>Opening the Clean Structures Dialog Box</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Clean Structures</span> dialog box:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Click <span class="GUI">Clean Structures</span> in the
<span class="GUI">Prepare Ligands</span> step of the
<span class="GUI">Develop Common Pharmacophore Hypotheses</span> panel.</p></li>
</ul>

<a name="using"></a>
<h2>Using the Clean Structures Dialog Box</h2>

<p>To develop a pharmacophore model, the ligand structures must be
three-dimensional, all-atom structures that closely represent the experimental
structures. Structure databases can be represented in 2D form, without explicit
hydrogen atoms, or with counter ions and solvent molecules. If any of these is
the case for your database, you must run a Clean Structures job to obtain
structures that are suitable for model development. The 2D-3D conversion,
removal of counter ions and solvent molecules, and energy minimization are
performed by default as part of the process.</p>

<p>If any of the structures do not have complete chirality information, you
should generate the combinations of chiralities to ensure that you have covered
the possibilities. Otherwise you can retain the specified chiralities or
determine the chiralities from the 3D structure. If you choose either of these
two options and the chiralities are not fully determined, the possible
stereoisomers will be generated. </p>

<p>When you vary the stereochemistry, you can limit the number of stereoisomers
generated. The process starts with the configuration at all chiral atoms set to
R, and systematically varies the configuration. If you select fewer
stereoisomers than the maximum, there is a chance that you might not generate
the most important isomers. </p>

<p>In the generation of the 3D database, stereoisomers are treated as separate
ligands. In the development of the pharmacophore model, you can choose to treat
stereoisomers as separate ligands or as conformers of the same ligand.</p>

<p>You can ensure that any acidic or basic groups in the structures are
appropriately ionized (protonated) for a selected pH value, which by default is
7, or you can neutralize the molecule or retain the input ionization states. 
For databases, you can also generate the most probable tautomers at pH 7.
These tasks are performed with the <code>ionizer</code> and
<code>tautomerizer</code> programs from LigPrep. If you want to use Epik for
these tasks, you must do so independently, and then provide the structures to
Phase. 
</p>

<p>Once you have selected options for cleaning up structures, click
<span class="GUI">Start</span> to run the cleanup job.

<h2>Clean Structures Dialog Box Features</h2>

<li><a href="#feature3"><span class="GUI">Ionization</span> section</a></li>
</ul>

<a name="feature2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Stereoisomers</span> section</dt>

<dd><p>In the <span class="GUI">Stereoisomers</span> section you can choose
from three options:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Retain specified chiralities</span>&mdash;If the ligand
has chirality information, this information is retained and 
used to ensure that the chiral atoms all have the correct chiralities. Chirality
information includes parities and bond directions from SD files and the
chirality property from Maestro files. If the configuration or chirality of a
chiral center is not specified, the two possible chiralities are generated.</p>
</li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Determine chiralities from 3D structures</span>&mdash;
This option discards any information from the input file and determines the
chirality from the 3D geometry. These chiralities are held fixed. For centers
whose chirality is indeterminate, the two possible chiralities are generated.
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Generate all combinations</span>&mdash;
This option discards chirality information and generates all possible
configurations that result from the combination of chiralities on each chiral
center.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can set the maximum number of stereoisomers to generate in the
<span class="GUI">Maximum stereoisomers per ligand</span> text box. </p>
</dd>

<a name="feature3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Ionization</span> section</dt>
<dd><p>In the <span class="GUI">Ionization</span> section you can choose
from three options:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Retain original states</span>&mdash;
This option bypasses the generation of ionization states. If the ligands all
have the correct ionization state for acidic and basic groups, choose this
option.
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Neutralize</span>&mdash;
This option converts all acidic and basic groups into their neutral form.
For example, zwitterion groups are converted from a carboxylate and an
ammonium to a carboxylic acid and an amine.
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Ionize at target pH</span>&mdash;
This option generates the most probable ionization state at the given target
pH, for which the default value is 7.
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The ionization states are generated by the <code>ionizer</code>. If you want
to use Epik, you must do so independently and then import the structures into
Phase.
