<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>In this panel you can set up a field-based QSAR model (CoMFA/CoMSIA)
from a set of aligned ligands, and use the model to predict activities for other
molecules. You can also visualize the QSAR model in the Workspace and create a
scatter plot of the activities.
</p>


<a name="background"></a>
<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Field-based QSAR methods originated with the CoMFA and CoMSIA methods,
described in <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc.</i> <b>1988</b>, <i>110</i>, 5959 and
<i>J. Med. Chem.</i> <b>1994</b>, <i>37</i>, 4130. 
</p>

<p>CoMFA field-based models are constructed by calculating the value of fields,
such as the electrostatic field, on a rectangular grid that encompasses the
molecules in the training set. Grid points that are closer than 2 &Aring; to any
atom in the training set are excluded. The grid locations are the independent
variables that are used in a partial-least-squares (PLS) fitting procedure to
produce a relationship between the values of the fields and the activity of the
training set molecules. 
</p>

<p>CoMSIA fields are also evaluated at points on a rectangular grid. The fields
are calculated by summing the values of properties of a given atom, weighted by
a Gaussian function of the distance between the grid point and the atom. The
steric contribution is derived from the third power of the atomic radius, the
electrostatic field from the partial atomic charges, and the hydrophobic field
from estimated ALOGP values. Hydrogen-bond receptor and donor fields have a
value of 1 at the donor location.
</p>

<p>The Schr&ouml;dinger field-based QSAR method is an implementation of the
CoMFA/CoMSIA methods with a specific set of parameters. The Lennard-Jones steric
potentials are taken from the OPLS_2005 force field, as are the atomic charges
for the electrostatic fields. Hydrophobic fields are based on the atom types and
hydrophobic parameters in Ghose, Viswanadhan, Wendoloski, J. Phys. Chem A
<b>1998</b>, <i>102</i>, 3762&ndash;3772 .Hydrogen bond acceptor and donor
fields are based on Phase pharmacophore feature definitions, with projected
points.
</p>
<p>As the models are not exactly the same as the standard CoMFA and CoMSIA
models, different names have been used here: Force Field for CoMFA-like
models, and Gaussian for CoMSIA-like models.
</p>

<p>Before performing the PLS regression, scaling is applied to each field, by
evaluating the standard deviation in the fields at each point, then averaging
the SD over all points. Each field is scaled by the ratio of the maximum of
these averages over all fields to the average for the field.
</p>

<h2>Opening the Field-Based QSAR Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Field-Based QSAR</span> panel, do one of the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Applications &rarr; Field-Based
QSAR</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Tasks &rarr; QSAR &rarr;
Field-Based</span>.</p></li>
</ul>

<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Field-Based QSAR Panel</h2> 

<p>To generate a QSAR model, you must first ensure that the ligands are
aligned. If the ligands were exported from the Develop Common Pharmacophore Hypotheses
procedure, they should already be prealigned to the pharmacophore model. You can
use the Phase command-line tool <code>pharm_align_mol</code> to align ligands to
a hypothesis. In Maestro, you can use the <span class="GUI">Superposition</span>
panel (<span class="GUI">Tools &rarr; Superposition</span>) to align the
ligands. The best choice is probably to align by a SMARTS pattern for the ligand
core.

<h3>Toolbar</h3>
<p>The toolbar has two buttons, for controlling what is displayed in the
Workspace for the model. The choice of fields and parameters can be made in the
<a href="field_qsar_vis_settings.html"><span class="GUI">Field-Based QSAR
Visualization Settings</span> panel<span class="GUI">Field-Based QSAR
Visualization Settings</span> panel</a>, which you open by clicking <span
class="GUI">QSAR Visualization</span>. The buttons are not available until a
model has been built.
</p>
<table border=0 cellpadding=5>
<tr>

<td><span class="GUI">View Contours</span><br />
Display surfaces in the Workspace for each field that are contoured at a
particular value ("isovalue") of the field. By default, the first field in the
list in the <a href="field_qsar_vis_settings.html"><span class="GUI">Field-Based
QSAR Visualization Settings</span> panel</a> is displayed.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/phase_view_intensities.png" /></td>

View the field intensities at each grid point as colored spheres. By default,
the first field in the list in the <a href="field_qsar_vis_settings.html"><span

</td>
</tr>

<a name="feature2"></a>
<h3>Add ligands buttons</h3>
<p>These buttons allow you to add ligands to the ligands table.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="GUI">From Project</span>&mdash;Opens the 
<a href="add_from_project_db.html"><span class="GUI">Add From Project</span>
dialog box</a>, in which you can choose a set of entries, select an activity
property, and assign training and test set memberships based on a property
value.
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">From File</span>&mdash;Opens a file selector, in which
you can navigate to and select the file. When you click <span
class="GUI">OK</span>, the <span class="GUI">Choose Activity Property</span> 
dialog box opens, in which you can select an activity property, converting it
into the appropriate units if need be, and select a QSAR set property, to define
the members of the training set and the test set by a value of this property.
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The ligands you add must be fully prepared 3D structures that are properly
aligned. No facility is provided in this panel for preparing the structures or
aligning the ligands.
</p>

<a name="feature3b"></a>
<h3>Delete and Delete All buttons</h3>
<p>These buttons allow you to delete ligands from the ligands table. 
The <span class="GUI">Delete</span> button deletes the selected ligands from the
table. This allows you to change a model by removing ligands, or replacing
ligands, for example. The <span class="GUI">Delete All</span> button removes all
ligands from the table. This is useful if you want to create a model with a
different set of ligands. 
</p>

<a name="feature3"></a>
<h3>Ligands table</h3>

<p>This table contains the list of ligands. When the ligands are first read, all
ligands are included in the training set, and the <span class="GUI">#
Factors</span>, <span class="GUI">Predicted Activity</span> and <span
class="GUI">Prediction Error</span>columns are empty. These columns are added
after the QSAR model is built. The table columns are described below.
</p>

<p>Most of the columns of this table are noneditable. You can change the activity
values, select the training and test sets, and display the ligands in the
Workspace. You can sort the table by the values in a column, by clicking the
column heading. Use shift-click and control-click to select multiple rows. 
</p>

<table cellpadding=5>
<tr>
<td><span class="GUI">In</span></td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>Inclusion status of the ligand. The diamond has a cross in it if the ligand
is included in the Workspace, and is empty if the ligand is excluded. You can

states. The state for the selected ligands is set to the state for the row that
is clicked. </td>

<h3>Field fractions table</h3>
<p>Display the fraction of each field in the QSAR model for each number of PLS
factors used in the model. This information can give you a general idea of the
overall relative impact of each field type on activity. For example, if steric
and hydrophobic Gaussian field fractions are much larger than the other types
(as is often the case), that suggests that most of the binding energy is coming
from hydrophobic interactions.

available.
