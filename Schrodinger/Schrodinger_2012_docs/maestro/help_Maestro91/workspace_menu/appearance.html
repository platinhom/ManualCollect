<a name="background"></a>
<h3>Background tab</h3>

<p>The background color can be set by clicking the color button and
choosing a color in the standard color selector that opens, or by clicking one
of the five preset color buttons. The color change takes effect immediately.
</p>
<p> Background color can also be set using text commands. An example
follows.</p>

<p>Command Syntax: <code>displayopt [bgcolor=</code><i>colorname</i><code> |
bgcindex=</code><i>colorindx</i><code>]</code> </p>

<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To color background red: <code>displayopt bgcolor=red</code></p> </li>
<li><p>To color background with the color at color index 5: <code>displayopt bgcindex=5</code></p></li>
</ul>

<a name="lighting"></a>
<h3>Lighting tab</h3>

<p>The lighting tab contains controls for the lighting effects on objects in the
Workspace.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><span class="GUI">Light direction</span> display</dt>
<dd><p>The light direction control allow you to pick the direction of the
selected light. To change the direction, click the desired location on the red
ball, or drag the yellow spot to the desired location.
</p></dd>
<dt>Light source list</dt>
<dd><p>Select the light source for which the direction and properties are to be
adjusted.
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Ambient</span> slider and text box</dt>
<dd><p>Set the ambient value with the slider, or enter the value in the text
box. This is the relative intensity of the (ambient) nondirectional light.
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Diffuse</span> slider and text box</dt>
<dd><p>Set the diffuse value with the slider, or enter the value in the text
box. This is the relative intensity of diffuse reflection (reflection that has
the same intensity in all directions).
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Specular</span> slider and text box</dt>
<dd><p>Set the specular value with the slider, or enter the value in the text
box. This is the specular reflection intensity (&quot;shiny&quot; reflection of
the light source) 
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Use light</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Select this option to use the selected light. Deselecting this option
disables the controls for the light.
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Restore Defaults</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Restore the settings to their default values.
</p></dd>
</dl>


<a name="materials"></a>
<h3>Materials tab</h3>

<p>The materials tab contains controls for the definition of the appearance of
the objects in the Workspace. Some preset material and lighting styles are
available on the <a href="../tool_bar/toolbars.html#style"><span
class="GUI">Style</span> toolbar</a>.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><span class="GUI">Object type</span> option menu</dt>
<dd><p>Select the object whose material appearance is to be customized.
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Presets</span> buttons</dt>
<dd><p>These four buttons, <span class="GUI">Metallic</span>, <span
class="GUI">Plastic</span>, <span class="GUI">Rubber</span>, <span
class="GUI">Wood</span>, set values of the properties that control the
appearance of the selected object.
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Custom</span> section</dt>
<dd><p>This section allows you to set the five properties of the material:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="GUI">Ambient</span>&mdash;intensity of ambient (nondirectional
incident) light</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Diffuse</span>&mdash;intensity of diffuse (nondirectional)
reflection of light</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Specular</span>&mdash;intensity of specular (directional)
reflection of light</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Emission</span>&mdash;light emission intensity of the object</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Shininess</span>&mdash;size and brightness of specular
highlight (larger value gives a smaller and brighter highlight)</li>
</ul>
<p>Each property has a slider and a text box. You can
use either of these controls to set the property value. </p>
<p>The Minimize performance cost option disables the <span
class="GUI">Ambient</span> and <span class="GUI">Diffuse</span>
controls, and uses these properties to track color.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<a name="3D"></a>
<h3>3D tab</h3>

<p>The <span class="GUI">3D</span> tab contains the
<a href="#stereo"><span class="GUI">Stereo</span></a> tab and the
<a href="#perspective"><span class="GUI">Perspective</span></a> tab. The common
controls, located below the tabs, are described first, then the tabs themselves.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>Common controls</dt>
<dd><p>
<dl>
<dt><span class="GUI">Alignment depth</span> slider and text box</dt>
<dd><p>This slider translates the region of molecule space bounded by the front
and back clipping planes. This appears to move objects within that region, in or
out (along the z-axis), relative to the screen. Smaller alignment depth values
place the displayed objects farther from the viewer (farther behind screen).
Larger values place objects closer to the viewer (farther in front of
screen).</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Adjust clipping to preserve depth cues</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>This option determines whether the front and back clipping planes should
be automatically adjusted to preserve the eye separation while displaying in
stereo and to preserve the perspective scale (corresponding to viewing distance)
when displaying in perspective. When this option is enabled, perceived depth is
maintained but some objects may be clipped, especially when zooming in (in which
case, you may also want to adjust the alignment depth).
If <span class="GUI">Adjust clipping to preserve depth cues</span> is
deselected, then the stereo and perspective settings are automatically adjusted
in order to preserve the front and back clipping planes. Then, objects are not
clipped more in front and back when zooming in, but are effectively flattened
(reducing their perceived depth). These automatic adjustments are not
permanent, but are done whenever the current 3D settings cannot be used to
display, in an acceptable manner, the entire region between the front and back
clipping planes.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Enhance Depth Cues</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Click this button to move the front and back clipping planes in to the fit
the parts of the structure currently displayed in the Workspace. This helps the
stereo and perspective depth cues work more effectively for the spatial region
of interest, reducing the need to clip objects or sacrifice depth cues in order
to accommodate the display of unoccupied regions of space.</p>
<p>You can also press the <span class="Keys">D</span> key with the pointer in
the Workspace, or choose <span class="GUI">View &rarr; Fog &rarr; Enhance Depth
Cues</span>.
</p></dd>
</dl>
</p></dd>

<a name="stereo"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Stereo</span> tab</dt>
<dd><p>
The settings in the <span class="GUI">Stereo</span> tab allow
you to view the structures displayed in the Workspace in stereo and to switch
between the stereo viewing methods. Stereo display only applies to the
Workspace&mdash;none of the Maestro main panel tools or other panels are
displayed in stereo. You might want to use full-screen mode when you are viewing
structures in stereo, which you can turn on and off with <span
class="Keys">Ctrl+=</span> (<span class="Keys">&#x2318;=</span>), or by choosing <span class="GUI">Workspace &gt; Full
Screen</span> and using <span class="Keys">ESC</span> to exit.</p>
<p>
You can also adjust the alignment depth to shift objects that you want to see
more clearly in stereo toward the plane of the screen.</p>

<p>The stereo method and settings persist across Maestro sessions.
</p>

<dl>

<dt><span class="GUI">Display in stereo</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Turn on the use of stereo display. This can also be done in the main
window with <span class="Keys">Ctrl+S</span> (<span class="Keys">&#x2318;S</span>) or by choosing <span
class="GUI">View &gt; Stereo</span>.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Swap stereo images</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Select this option to swap the images for the right eye and the left eye. 
This is useful to resolve synchronization problems with hardware stereo. It
applies also to the software stereo methods, and has the effect of swapping
cross-eyed and wall-eyed stereo. 
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Method</span> option menu</dt>
<dd><p>Select a stereo viewing method from this option menu. 
 There are four stereo viewing options:<p></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="GUI">Wall-eyed</span>: (default)
In the &quot;wall-eyed&quot; stereo viewing method, the eyes focus on both
displayed images at once, instead of focusing at a central point. One difficulty
that may arise when using this stereo viewing method is that it is
difficult, if not impossible, to achieve the stereo effect when the images
are more than the inter-ocular distance apart, or about 2.5 inches.
Structures more than 2.5 inches wide will therefore need to be resized and
repositioned using the <a href="#stereo3.2"><span class="GUI">Size factor</span></a> and
<a href="#stereo3.3"><span class="GUI">Separation factor</span></a> sliders. The
height of the molecule is not critical for stereo viewing. 
Any height less than the window height is acceptable.<p></p>

To use the <span class="GUI">Wall-Eyed</span> stereo viewing option, stare past
the screen as if focusing on an image far beyond it. This tactic tricks the eyes
into focusing in a plane beyond the screen. When performed correctly,
wall-eyed viewing produces three images, with the center one being a 3D
combination of the two outer ones. <p></p></li>

<a name="stereo3.1.2"></a>
<li><span class="GUI">Cross-Eyed</span>: This stereo method is difficult and is
not advised for stereo viewing novices, since inadvertently viewing the
cross-eyed image wall-eyed will result in the molecule being inverted along the
z-axis. This can produce inaccurate depth information, particularly when the
wire molecular representation is being used. <p></p></li>

<a name="stereo3.1.3"></a>
<li><span class="GUI">Hardware</span>: This method requires a suitable monitor
(refresh rate greater than 100&nbsp;Hz), a graphics card that supports
quad-buffered stereo, and 3D glasses. A warning is displayed if the hardware
does not support stereo and this option is selected. This option is not
available on Mac platforms, which do not in general support hardware stereo.
</li>
</ul>

<a name="stereo3.1.4"></a>
<li><span class="GUI">Interlaced</span>: This method also requires a 
monitor that supports interlacing, and 3D glasses. Interlaced stereo works on
all supported platforms if the hardware is available. A warning is displayed if
the hardware does not support stereo and this option is selected.</li>
</ul>
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Size factor</span> slider</dt>
<dd><p>Use this slider to reduce the size of the displayed structure to
better facilitate cross-eyed or wall-eyed viewing.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Separation factor</span> slider</dt>
<dd><p>Use this slider to decrease the distance between the left and right
stereo images. This feature eases cross-eyed and wall-eyed viewing.
The <span class="GUI">Separation factor</span> slider becomes available once the
displayed structures have been resized with the <span class="GUI">Size
factor</span> slider (see above).
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Eye separation</span> slider</dt>

<dd><p>Use this slider to adjust the stereo viewing angle, which governs the
amount of depth perceived in stereo. The stereo viewing angle increases roughly
in proportion to eye separation, and increases with perspective scale (decreases
in nearly inverse proportion to viewing distance). The slider should generally
be positioned near the center of the range, to correspond to a
&quot;normal&quot; adult inter-ocular distance of 2.5 inches and viewing
distance of 24 inches. Use smaller values for smaller inter-ocular distance or
larger viewing distance, or to reduce the side-effects of larger stereo angles,
such as clipping and double images.  Use larger values for larger inter-ocular
distance or smaller viewing distance, or to increase the amount of perceived
depth.</p>
<p>Reducing this parameter can help stereo perception with interlaced stereo
on certain monitors.
</p></dd>

</dl>

</dd>

<a name="perspective"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Perspective</span> tab</dt>
<dd><p>The Perspective feature helps facilitate 3D viewing by scaling the
apparent size of objects according to their z-axis depth (making more
distant objects appear smaller, as in normal viewing). To use perspective,
select <span class="GUI">Display in perspective</span>. Perspective is enabled
by default. </p>
<p>The amount of perspective, which relates to the viewing distance, can be
adjusted using the <span class="GUI">Perspective scale</span> slider.
Here, perspective scale is the ratio between the actual size and the
projected size of an object placed 0.7 feet behind the display screen.
This has a corresponding viewing distance,<br /><br />
view_dist = (0.7 ft) / (perspective_scale - 1)<br /><br />
For a known viewing distance,<br /><br />
perspective_scale = 1 + (0.7 ft / view_dist)<br /><br />
Therefore, for a normal viewing distance of 2 feet,<br /><br />
perspective_scale = 1 + (0.7 ft / 2 ft) = 1.35<br /><br />
To get a stronger depth cue, using exaggerated perspective, you can use
larger perspective scale values.</p>
<p>The <span class="GUI">Alignment depth</span> slider can be used to shift
objects in or out of the screen, in order to change their relative size (depth
scaling) or clipping.</p>
<p>
When perspective is in use, the viewing volume indicator (shown in green in the
<a href="../workspace/clipping_planes.html">clipping planes window</a>) takes a
trapezoidal shape that reflects the perspective scale.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<a name="fog"></a>
<h3>Fog tab</h3>
<p>The Fog feature helps facilitate 3D viewing by providing emphasis on
the parts of the structure that are closest to you. Closer parts of the
molecule appear as the pure currently selected atom color, and more
distant parts appear to turn gray and finally disappear into the
background. Fog can be useful when hardware-assisted stereo viewing is
not available, but it is also helpful when used in conjunction with stereo
viewing.</p>
<dl>
<dt><span class="GUI">Display fog</span> option menu</dt>
<dd><p>Select the conditions under which fogging is used. 
<ul>
<li><span class="GUI">Automatic</span>&mdash;Turn fog on if there are more than
40 atoms in the Workspace. </li>
<li><span class="GUI">On</span>&mdash;turn fogging on for all atoms</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Off</span>&mdash;turn fogging off for all atoms</li>
</ul>
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Display fog on atom labels</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Apply fogging to atom labels as well as to atoms. 
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Method</span> option menu</dt>
<dd><p>This option menu contains three fogging gradient types:
<span class="GUI">Linear</span>, <span class="GUI">Exponential</span>, and
<span class="GUI">Exponential Squared</span>. Currently, only the
<span class="GUI">Linear</span> method should be used when displaying in
perspective.</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Linear Start</span> and
<span class="GUI">Linear End</span> sliders</dt>
<dd><p>The <span class="GUI">Linear Start</span> and <span class="GUI">Linear
End</span> sliders allow you to increase
or decrease the range of available colors created by fog gradations.
<span class="GUI">Linear Start</span> moves the plane that defines the fog
boundary that is closest to the screen. <span class="GUI">Linear End</span>
moves the fog boundary that is behind the structure. There is a finite number of
gradations, and if there is empty space, some of them are wasted.</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Density</span> slider</dt>
<dd><p>This slider allows you to increase the contrast of colors created by the
fogging feature. Closer portions of the structure will appear even brighter and
more distant ones will more quickly converge on the background color.</p></dd>
