<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Use this tab to enter information for the quantum mechanics (QM) calculation,
and to define the region to be treated quantum-mechanically.</p>

<p>The QM information includes the QM method to be used, the charge and spin
multiplicity of the QM system, and other keywords and options that may be
required by Jaguar.  For more information on Jaguar options, see the
<a href="../../../jaguar/jaguar_user_manual.pdf"
target="pdfmanuals"><i>Jaguar User Manual</i></a>.</p>

<p>The QM region is defined using any of the following
methods:</p>

<ul>
<li>Selecting the ligand, metal ions, or other disconnected species that are
not covalently bonded to the protein.</li>
<li>Specifying <i>cuts</i> between certain covalently-bonded atoms
in connected peptide residues.</li>
<li>Specifying <i>hydrogen caps</i> on atoms that are in the QM region that are
singly-bonded to atoms in the MM region.</li>
</ul>

<p>QSite cuts are specially parametrized frozen-orbital boundaries between the
QM and MM regions. They can be placed between an alpha carbon and a side chain
(side-chain cuts) or between an alpha carbon and the backbone to one side
(backbone cuts, which must be made in pairs to add the residues between them to
the QM region).</p>

<p>In QSite 5.8, cuts are parametrized to the OPLS_2001 force field.  Side-chain
and backbone cuts can be made as described in this topic only if the <span
class="GUI">Force field</span> option selected in the QSite <span
class="GUI">Potential</span> tab is <span class="GUI">OPLS_2001</span>, the
default.</p>

<p>Cuts in a protein-ligand complex must be between atoms in peptide residues.
Covalently-bound ligands can be included in the QM region when defining cuts,
but only along with attached protein atoms. The QM region must extend at least
as far as the first permissible cut between protein atoms.</p>

<p>Hydrogen caps can be placed on any atom designated to be in the QM region,
provided that it is singly-bonded to an atom in the MM region. This option
offers much more flexibility in the selection of the QM region. The MM atom is
replaced with a hydrogen atom in the QM calculation. </p>

<p>See <a href="qsite_panel.html#rules">Rules and Procedures for Creating
the QM/MM Boundary</a> for more detail.

<h2>QM Settings Tab Features</h2>

<p>The QM Settings tab contains a set of general controls, and two subtabs.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#feature1">General Settings</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature2"><span class="GUI">QM Region</span> subtab</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature3"><span class="GUI">QM Basis</span> subtab</a></li>
</ul>

<a name="feature1"></a>
<h3>General Settings</h3>

<p>The general settings at the top of the panel define the type of QM
calculation to perform.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#feature1.1"><span class="GUI">Method</span> option menu</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature1.2"><span class="GUI">Spin-unrestricted</span> option</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature1.3"><span class="GUI">Charge</span> text box</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature1.4"><span class="GUI">Multiplicity</span> text box</a></li>

<li><a href="#feature1.6"><span class="GUI">Hydrogen cap electrostatics</span>
option menu</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature1.7">Input file options</a></li>
</ul>

<dl>
<a name="feature1.1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Method</span> option menu</dt>
<dd><p>Select the QM method for the calculation. The available options include
Hartree-Fock, local MP2, density functional methods with a variety of
functionals, and a range of semiempirical NDDO methods. The
<span class="GUI">DFT-User defined</span> option is selected 
when an input file is read that specifies a functional other than those
available from this menu. Otherwise this option is not available. </p>

<p>For more information on QM methods, see the
<a href="../jaguar/jaguar_panel.html">Jaguar Panel</a> topic or the
<a href="../../../jaguar/jaguar_user_manual.pdf"
target="pdfmanuals"><i>Jaguar User Manual</i></a>. Details of the DFT methods are
available in
<a href="../../../jaguar/jaguar_user_manual.pdf#nameddest=M6.8.newlink.top"
target="pdfmanuals">Chapter&nbsp;3</a>. For more information on the
semiempirical methds, see the 
<a href="../../../general/semiempirical_nddo.pdf"
target="pdfmanuals"><i>Semiempirical NDDO Guide</i></a>.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature1.2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Spin-unrestricted</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Select this option to perform a spin-unrestricted open-shell calculation.
This option is only available with the <span class="GUI">Hartree-Fock</span> and
<span class="GUI">DFT-B3LYP</span> methods. Otherwise, open-shell calculations
will be performed with the restricted open-shell methods.</p></dd>

<a name="feature1.3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Charge</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>This is the net charge of the QM region of
the system. Maestro updates the <span class="GUI">Charge</span>
to a reasonable value whenever a new residue or ion is added to the
QM region; if a discrepancy appears, edit the value.
If this value does not match the sum
of the formal charges of the atoms in the QM region, Maestro
displays a warning message, but allows you to proceed.</p></dd>

<a name="feature1.4"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Multiplicity</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>This text box displays the spin multiplicity of the QM region of the system: 1
for singlet, 2 for doublet, etc. Edit the value if necessary.
If there is a discrepancy between the total
charge and the multiplicity, the Jaguar calculation will halt
with an error message. The charge and multiplicity of the
QM region must be consistent.</p></dd>

<a name="feature1.5"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">QM options</span> text box</dt>
<dd><p>This text box can contain any Jaguar keywords such as print flag
settings, non-default convergence criteria, and so on.  Each such option is of
the form <tt>keyword=value</tt>.  Multiple keyword/value pairs can be
specified, separated by one or more blanks.
By default, the following QM options appear in the box:</p>
<pre>
iacc=1 vshift=1.0 maxit=100
</pre>
<p>You can remove or modify these options as appropriate. See
<a href="../../../jaguar/jaguar_user_manual.pdf#nameddest=M11.8.newlink.top"

</dd>

<a name="feature1.6"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Hydrogen cap electrostatics</span> option menu</dt>
<dd><p>This option menu allows you to choose how atoms in the MM region in the
vicinity of a hydrogen cap are treated when calculating their electrostatic
interaction with the QM region. It is only available when you are using hydrogen
caps to define part or all of the QM region.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="GUI">Gaussian grid</span>&mdash;Use Gaussian charge
distributions to represent the potential of the atoms near the cap, and MM point
charges for the rest of the MM region, with the Gaussian charge distribution and
potential represented on a grid. </li>
<li><span class="GUI">Gaussian charges</span>&mdash;Use Gaussian charge
distributions to represent the potential of the atoms near the cap, and MM point
charges for the rest of the MM region. The potential is calculated analytically,
but is not available for CIS and TDDFT calculations, or for properties that
require a CPHF calculation. Use <span class="GUI">Gaussian grid</span>
instead.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">Point charges</span>&mdash;Use modified point charges to
represent the potential of the atoms near the cap, and MM point charges for the rest
of the MM region.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">None</span>&mdash;Ignore electrostatic interactions
between the QM and MM regions in the region of the caps. Van der Waals
interactions are still included. </li>
</ul>
</dd>
<a name="feature1.7"></a>
<dt>Input file options</dt>
<dd><p>These options (<span class="GUI">Use wave function in input file</span>
and <span class="GUI">Use Hessian in input file</span>) allow you to read the
wave function and the Hessian from the input file, and make use of them in the
calculation. This capability is particularly useful when restarting a
calculation.</p>
<p>Not available for semiempirical methods.

<h3>QM Region Subtab</h3>

<p>In this subtab, you set up the QM region. The total number of atoms in the QM
region is displayed below this subtab.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#feature2.1">QM region table</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature2.2"><span class="GUI">Pick</span> option and menu</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature2.3"><span class="GUI">Show markers</span> option</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature2.4"><span class="GUI">Delete</span> and <span class="GUI">Delete
All</span> buttons</a></li>
</ul>

<dl>
<a name="feature2.1"></a>
<dt>QM region table</dt>
<dd><p>The cuts that define the QM region are listed in the table.
The <span class="GUI">Type</span> column gives the cut type, and corresponds to
the choice made from the <span class="GUI">Pick</span> option menu to define the
cut. The <span class="GUI">Name</span> column identifies the cut:</p>
<ul>
<li>side chain&mdash;Residue name and number</li>
<li>entire residue&mdash;Residue name and number</li>
<li>ligand/ion&mdash;Molecule number</li>
<li>hydrogen cap&mdash;<code>QM atom=</code><i>number</i><code>, MM
atom=</code><i>number</i></li>
</ul>
<p>When you have finished picking to define a cut or a set of QM atoms, table
rows are added for each cut or atom set. </p>
</dd>

<a name="feature2.2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Pick</span> option and menu</dt>
<dd><p>Select this option to pick the location of one or more cuts, and choose
the type of cut from the option menu. Note that a residue can be an amino acid
residue, a free ligand or solvent molecule, or an ion.
</p>
<dl>
<a name="feature2.2.1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Side chain</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>Select this option to add only the side chain of an amino acid residue to the
QM region, leaving the backbone in the MM region.  Pick an atom in the side
chain you want to include.  The side chain is marked with ball and stick markers
in sienna if <span class="GUI">Show markers</span> is selected.  A cut is made
between the alpha carbon and beta carbon of that residue. All of the atoms in
the side chain will be part of the QM region.</p>

<p>Side-chain cuts can be made in any peptide residue other than alanine (ALA),
glycine (GLY), and proline (PRO). (To incorporate these side chains in the QM
region, you must use backbone cuts and include the entire residue.)  Side-chain
cuts can be made in positively-charged histidine (HIP) as well.</p>
<p>Not available for semiempirical methods.
</p>
</dd>

<a name="feature2.2.2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Entire residue</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>To add entire amino acid residues to the QM region, select this option and
then pick two backbone atoms that are not alpha carbons and are at least three
backbone bonds apart. The first backbone atom you pick is marked with a purple
cube. The cut between MM and QM atoms is made between the selected atom and
the alpha carbon bonded to it. Another cut is made between the second
backbone atom you pick and its adjacent alpha carbon.  All of the backbone and
side-chain atoms between the two cuts are marked with ball and stick markers in
sienna to show that they have been selected for the QM region, if <span
class="GUI">Show markers</span> is selected.  Backbone cuts
can be made in any peptide residue, including glycine, proline, and their
adjacent residues, and including positively-charged histidine (HIP).</p>

<p>The cuts made with this choice use the frozen-orbitals method for defining
the terminus of the QM region.</p>
<p>Not available for semiempirical methods.
</p>
</dd>

<a name="feature2.2.3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Free ligand/ion</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>Entire free ligands, metal ions, or other species not covalently bound to the
protein can be added to the QM region by this method, which does not make any
cuts between atoms. Select this option and then pick an atom in the ligand
molecule or pick a metal ion to add it to the QM region list. Molecules are
marked with ball and stick markers in sienna, and single atoms or ions are
marked with green axes,  if <span class="GUI">Show markers</span> is selected.</p>

<p>Ligands that are covalently bound to the protein cannot be added using this
method, because this method does not make parametrized cuts between bonded
atoms.  To add covalently-bound ligands to the QM region, make either a pair of
backbone cuts to select the residue to which the ligand is bound, or make a
side-chain cut.</p>
</dd>

<a name="feature2.2.4"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Hydrogen cap</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>To define cuts that are capped by hydrogen atoms rather than atoms with
frozen orbitals, select this option and then pick the QM atom followed by the MM
atom on either side of the cut. The QM atom and the MM atom must be joined by a
single bond. The MM atom is replaced by a hydrogen atom in the QM calculation.
The QM region usually requires two or more cuts. The markers in the Workspace
are not updated after making this kind of cut. Instead, you must click
<span class="GUI">Update QM Region Display</span> to display the markers for the
QM region (provided <span class="GUI">Show markers</span> is selected).
</p>

<p>Once you have created a hydrogen cap, the <a href="#feature1.6"><span
class="GUI">Hydrogen cap electrostatics</span> option menu</a> in the general
section becomes available, and you can choose the electrostatic treatment of MM
atoms near the cap. </p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<a name="feature2.3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Show markers</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>When this option is selected, atoms in the QM region are marked with
ball and stick markers in sienna.</p></dd>

<a name="feature2.4"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Delete</span> and
<span class="GUI">Delete All</span> buttons</dt>
<dd>
<p>To remove atoms from the QM region or redefine cuts, select the rows in the QM
region table and click <span class="GUI">Delete</span>.
Take care to ensure that the resulting QM region is consistent with any
backbone cuts that have been made.</p>
<p>To clear the QM region definition, click <span class="GUI">Delete All</span>.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<a name="feature3"></a>
<h3>QM Basis subtab</h3>

<p>In this subtab you can view and change the basis set associated with each
atom in the QM Region. This subtab is not available for semiempirical methods.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#feature3.1">Basis set table</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature3.2"><span class="GUI">Pick</span> option and menu</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature3.3"><span class="GUI">Show markers</span> option</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature3.4"><span class="GUI">Basis set</span> option menu</a></li>
</ul>

<dl>
<a name="feature3.1"></a>
<dt>Basis set table</dt>
<dd>
<p>This table lists the basis set used for each QM atom. The atom is identified in
the <span class="GUI">QM Atom</span> column, and the basis set used is given in
the <span class="GUI">Basis</span> column. You can select multiple rows and
apply a basis set to the selection.</p></dd>

<a name="feature3.2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Pick</span> option and menu</dt>
<dd><p>Select this option to pick atoms for which you want to change the basis
set. Three of the options on the menu are the same as in the <span
class="GUI">QM Region</span> tab, and work in the same way. The <span
class="GUI">Hydrogen cap</span> option is not present; instead there is
an <span class="GUI">Atom</span> option that enables you to pick individual
atoms. The atoms you pick are marked with green axes if <span class="GUI">Show
markers</span> is selected, and they are also selected in the basis set table.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature3.3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Show markers</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>When this option is selected, the atoms that are selected in the table or
picked are marked with green axes.</p></dd>

<a name="feature3.4"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Basis set</span> option menu</dt>
<dd>
<p>Choose the basis set for the selected rows in the basis set table from this
option menu. By default, the basis set used for the entire QM region
is LACVP*, which uses 6-31G* for non-transition metals. This is the basis set
used in the parameterization of the frozen orbital cuts.</p>
