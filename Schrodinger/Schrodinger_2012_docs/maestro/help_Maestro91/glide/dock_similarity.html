<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Use the options in the <span class="GUI">Similarity</span> tab to set up and
incorporate atom pair similarity scoring in your docking job.  Similarity
algorithms provide a mechanism for quantifying how alike or unlike two molecules
are. This similarity can be a criterion for selecting likely candidates&mdash;
molecules similar or dissimilar to a collection of probe molecules (typically
known actives)&mdash;from a large molecular database.</p>

<p>Similarity or dissimilarity scoring is combined with the results of Glide
docking to produce a composite score.  By default, no similarity scoring is
performed.</p>

<p>Glide uses an atom-pair based similarity scoring algorithm
which is dependent only on 2D molecular structures.
In calculating an atom-pair similarity between two molecules,
their structures are first processed to generate
sets of atom pairs.  Each non-hydrogen atom is represented by a similarity
type (not the same as the atom typing used in Liaison or QSite) based
on the connectivity, bond orders, and formal charges of the molecule.
For each pair of similarity types, the shortest bonded path
between the two atoms (the path with the smallest number of connections)
is determined. The unique combination of:</p>

<p>type(atom A) + connectivity distance + type(atom B)</p>

<p>defines one atom pair. All atom pairs for a given molecule constitute the
atom pair list for that molecule. The similarity between two molecules is a
function of the number of atom pairs that appear on both lists.  The similarity
function is normalized so that the similarity score is a number between 0.0 (no
atom pairs in common) and 1.0 (identical atom pair lists.)</p>

</ul>

<a name="feature1"></a>
<h3>Mode Options</h3>

<p>The default is not to use similarity scoring. You
can use similarity scoring to find ligands similar to
known actives or to find ligands that are
dissimilar to them:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#feature1.1"><span class="GUI">
Do not use similarity</span></a></li>
<li><a href="#feature1.2"><span class="GUI">
Find similar ligands</span></a></li>
<li><a href="#feature1.3"><span class="GUI">
Find dissimilar ligands</span></a></li>
</ul><br />

<dl>
<a name="feature1.1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">
Do not use similarity</span></dt>
<dd><p>
This option is selected by default. The docking job
docks and scores ligands without calculating or
using similarity scores.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature1.2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">
Find similar ligands</span></dt>
<dd><p>
Select this option to penalize ligands that are
structurally different from known actives.
In the results of the docking job,
ligands that score well and are similar
to known actives will be ranked high.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature1.3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">
Find dissimilar ligands</span></dt>
<dd><p>
Select this option to penalize ligands that are
structurally similar to known actives.
In the results of the docking job,
ligands that score well and are different from
known actives will be ranked high.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<a name="feature2"></a>
<h3>File of Known Actives</h3>

<p>Specify a file with known active ligands, either by
typing the file name in the
<span class="GUI">File of known actives</span> text box
or by clicking <span class="GUI">Browse</span>
to use a file selector. The file must be in Maestro, SD, or MOL2 format.
</p>

<a name="feature3"></a>
<h3>Use Trained Similarity Model</h3>

<p>The default, the untrained similarity model,
assigns equal significance to all atom pair matches.
A trained similarity model assigns greater significance to
some atom pair matches than to others.  The weighting of atom pair matches requires a
file of active ligands and a file of presumed inactives.  Glide uses the
two files to determine the set of weights that maximizes active-active
similarity scores and minimizes active-inactive similarity scores.</p>

<p>Use the options in this group to apply a particular
trained similarity model by specifying the weights file to apply.
If you have not yet created a weights file,
but would like to use a trained model, you can generate
a new weights file in
the <span class="GUI">Create Similarity Model</span>
panel, which is opened from this tab.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#feature3.1"><span class="GUI">

Model file</span> text box and <span class="GUI">Browse</span> button</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature3.3"><span class="GUI">Create</span> button</a></li>
</ul><br />

<dl>
<a name="feature3.1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">
Use trained similarity model</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>
Select this option to employ a set of weighted atom pairs,
creating a trained similarity model. If you do not
select this option, the standard, unweighted similarity
model will be used.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature3.2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">
Model file</span> text box and <span class="GUI">Browse</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>
A trained similarity model is the combination of
the similarity algorithm with a set of weighted atom pairs.
The weighted atom pairs are stored in a file named
<i>filename</i><tt>.wgt</tt>. For simplicity,
this file is sometimes referred to as the
<i>trained similarity model file</i>.
If you already have a trained similarity model file,
type the file name in the text box, or click the
<span class="GUI">Browse</span> button
to open a file selector.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature3.3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Create</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>
To generate a trained similarity model,
click <span class="GUI">Create</span> to open the
<span class="GUI">Create Similarity Model</span> panel,
in which you can set up a job to
generate a set of optimized weights for a trained model.
See the
<a href="create_similarity_model.html">Create Similarity Model</a>
topic for details.
When the weight generation job finishes, the set of weights is written to the
trained similarity model file, <i>jobname</i><tt>.wgt</tt>.
The file name and path appear in the <span class="GUI">Model file</span>
text box.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<a name="feature4"></a>
<h3>Similarity Scoring Function</h3>

<p>Similarity information is incorporated into docking results
according to a scoring function
that assigns a GlideScore penalty based on a ligand's similarity
score, which has been normalized to a value between 0.00 and 1.00.
The general shape of the scoring function depends on your choice of
similarity <span class="GUI">Mode</span>.
If you have selected <span class="GUI">Find similar ligands</span>,
penalties decrease with increasing similarity.
If you have selected <span class="GUI">Find dissimilar ligands</span>,
penalties increase with increasing similarity.</p>

<p>The details of the scoring function are controlled by
parameters that you can change if necessary.
This section of the <span class="GUI">Similarity</span>
tab contains the four parameter settings for the
<span class="GUI">Similarity scoring function</span>.
Beneath these options, a plot of the scoring function is
displayed. The plot is updated
each time you enter a new value for one of the parameters.</p>

<p>These are the features of this section of the
<span class="GUI">Similarity</span> tab.
In describing features that differ according to similarity mode
(<span class="GUI">Find similar ligands</span> or
<span class="GUI">Find dissimilar ligands</span>),
the default is assumed to be
<span class="GUI">Find similar</span>.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#feature4.1"><span class="GUI">
Maximum GlideScore penalty</span> <i>p</i>
<span class="GUI">kcal/mol</span></a></li>
<li><a href="#feature4.2"><span class="GUI">

<li><a href="#feature4.3"><span class="GUI">

<span class="GUI"> and</span> <i>n</i></a></li>
<li><a href="#feature4.4"><span class="GUI">

</ul><br />

<dl>
<a name="feature4.1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">
Maximum GlideScore penalty</span> <i>p</i></dt>
<dd><p>
This is the maximum penalty for ligands with low similarity scores
(or, if <span class="GUI">Find dissimilar ligands</span>
is selected, for ligands with high similarity scores.)
The relative importance of the similarity score and the
basic GlideScore to the combined result can be adjusted by changing this number.
As the maximum penalty is increased, similarity becomes
more important than docking; decreasing the maximum penalty
has the reverse effect.
The default value of <i>p</i>, 6.00 kcal/mol,
gives roughly equal weighting to the
similarity score and GlideScore for most systems,
which is generally optimal.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature4.2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">
Reject below</span> <i>r</i></dt>
<dd><p>
Ligands with similarity scores below the threshold
<i>r</i> will not be docked. The default value of <i>r</i>
is 0.00. Since similarity scores cannot be negative, the
default is to dock all ligands regardless of similarity.<p>

If the mode is <span class="GUI">Find dissimilar ligands</span>,
the option is <span class="GUI">Reject above</span>: ligands
with similarity higher than <i>r</i> will not be docked.
The default is 1.00, a score that cannot be exceeded,
and therefore corresponds to docking all ligands.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature4.3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">
Partially penalize between</span> <i>m</i>
<span class="GUI"> and</span> <i>n</i></dt>
<dd><p>
Ligands with similarity scores lower than <i>m</i>
receive the maximum penalty. Those with similarity
higher than <i>n</i> receive no penalty. Similarity
scores between <i>m</i> and <i>n</i> receive a
penalty that decreases linearly from the maximum value
at <i>m</i> to zero at <i>n</i>, as shown
in the scoring function plot. The default value of
<i>m</i> is 0.30. The default value of <i>n</i>
is 0.70.</p>

<p>In <span class="GUI">Find dissimilar ligands</span> mode,
the default values of <i>m</i> and <i>n</i> remain the same,
but no penalty is applied to ligands with similarity
scores of <i>m</i> or lower. Scores between <i>m</i> and <i>n</i>
receive increasing penalties, reaching the maximum penalty
at <i>n</i> and above.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature4.4"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">
Similarity</span> scoring function plot</dt>
<dd><p>
GlideScore penalties ranging from 0.0 to the
the maximum, <i>p</i>, are plotted against similarity score,
which ranges from 0.0 to 1.0. The plot is updated
to reflect a change in the value of a parameter
(<i>p</i>, <i>r</i>, <i>m</i>, or <i>n</i>) when you
press <span class="GUI">ENTER</span>
or click in the next parameter text box.
