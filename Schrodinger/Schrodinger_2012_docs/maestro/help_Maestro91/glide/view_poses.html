<p>The <span class="GUI">Project Table</span> panel offers a special facility
for viewing poses from a pose viewer file. This facility allows you to step
through poses with the receptor fixed in the Workspace. You can also define and
display hydrogen bonds, contacts, and per-residue interactions, and count
hydrogen bonds and contacts. If you have flexible hydroxyl groups
(&quot;rotatable groups&quot;) in the receptor, these are shown in the correct
orientation for each pose, and you can export the receptor and
poses for given orientations of the rotatable groups.</p>
</p>These capabilites are available by choosing 
<span class="GUI">Entry &rarr; View Poses</span> 
in the <span class="GUI">Project Table</span> panel, or by
choosing <span class="GUI">Applications &rarr; Glide &rarr; View Poses</span> in
the main window.
</p>  

<p><span class="HB">To start using the pose viewing facility:</span></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Select a single entry group.</p>
<p>The group must contain the receptor as the first entry in the group, followed
by the ligands. This is the normal situation when you import a pose viewer file
into the project.</p></li>

<li><p>Choose 
<span class="GUI">Entry &rarr; View Poses</span> 
&rarr; Setup</span>.</p>
<p>The receptor is locked in the Workspace, the first ligand entry is
included in the Workspace, and the view zooms to the ligand.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>or, if the results are not already imported, 
do one of the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Applications &rarr; Glide &rarr; View Poses
&rarr; Import Glide Results</span>, then navigate to and import the pose-viewer
file.
</p></li>
<li><p>Click the <span class="GUI">Import</span> button, ensure that
<span class="GUI">For pose-viewer files, turn on pose viewing</span> is
selected, then then navigate to and import the pose-viewer
file.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>You can now perform the following actions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Step through the poses using the right arrow and left arrow keys.
</p></li>
<li><p>Use the ePlayer to step through the poses, play through the poses
automatically, and perform actions on the poses with a script.</p>
<p>For more information, see 
<a href="../eplayer/eplayer.html">The ePlayer</a>.
</p></li> 
<li><p>Display hydrogen bonds and contacts. </p>
<p>To do so, choose <span class="GUI">Display H-bonds </span> or 
<span class="GUI">Display Contacts</span> from the 
<span class="GUI">View Poses</span> submenu. The H-bonds and contacts are turned
on for each ligand in the entry group. You can also set the parameters that
define H-bonds and contacts from this submenu. The <span class="GUI">Define
H-bonds</span> and <span class="GUI">Define Contacts</span> items open the
<a href="../tools_menu/hbonds_contacts.html"><span class="GUI">H-Bonds and
Contacts</span> panel</a> at the relevant tabs. If you want to write out the
H-bonds or contacts, you can do so from the 
<a href="../tools_menu/hbonds_contacts.html"><span class="GUI">H-Bonds and
Contacts</span> panel</a>.
</p></li>
<li><p>Calculate counts of hydrogen bonds and contacts.</p>
<p>To do this, choose <span class="GUI">Count H-bonds</span> or <span
class="GUI">Count Contacts</span> from the <span class="GUI">View Poses</span> 
submenu. The counts may take a little time to evaluate. They are added as
properties to the Project Table.
</p></li>
<li><p>Visualize per-residue interactions.</p>
<p>This can only be done if you selected <span class="GUI">Write per-residue
interaction scores for residues within <i>N</i> &Aring; of grid center</span> in
the <a href="dock_output.html"><span class="GUI">Output</span>
tab</a> of the Glide <span class="GUI">Ligand Docking</span> panel. The 
visualization  is turned on by choosing <span class="GUI">Display Per-Residue
Interactions</span> from the <span class="GUI">View Poses</span> submenu. The
per-residue interactions are represented by coloring the residues by the value
of the interaction, using a color ramp. To select the residues that are colored
and which interactions are visualized, choose <span class="GUI">Define
Per-Residue Interactions</span> from the <span class="GUI">View Poses</span>
submenu, and make settings in the 
<a href="../pt_entry_menu/per_residue_interactions_panel.html"><span
class="GUI">Per-Residue Interactions</span> panel</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Export the receptor and poses with particular orientations of rotatable
groups in the receptor.
</p>
<p>If you have defined a set of rotatable groups (hydroxyls in Ser, Thr, and Tyr
residues) in the receptor, you can export the receptor with different
orientations of these groups. The coordinates of the receptor in the pose viewer
file are for the original orientation, but the receptor includes information on
the alternative orientations. This option allows you to write a file with the
alternative coordinates.</p>
<p>To do so, you should first include one of the
poses that has this orientation in the Workspace. Next, from the <span
class="GUI">Entry</span> menu, choose <span class="GUI">View Poses</span>,
then <span class="GUI"> Export Rotatable Groups</span>. In the 
<a href="../project_facility/export_rotatable_groups_db.html"><span
class="GUI">Export Rotatable Groups</span> dialog box</a> you can choose whether
to export just the receptor, the receptor and the included pose, or the receptor
and all poses for which the receptor has that particular orientation of the
flexible groups.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="HB">To finish viewing poses:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Select the receptor entry.</p>
<p>The <span class="GUI">View Poses</span> submenu is no longer available,
because a single entry group is no longer selected.
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Entry &rarr; Exclude</span>, or type <span
class="Keys">Ctrl+X</span> (<span class="Keys">&#x2318;X</span>). </p>
<p>The receptor is no longer locked in the Workspace.
</p></li>
</ol>
