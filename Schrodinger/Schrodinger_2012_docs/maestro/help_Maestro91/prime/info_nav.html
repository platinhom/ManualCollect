<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Prime Structure Prediction provides more than one way of moving from one step
to another. While the simplest workflow can be navigated by clicking the <span
class="GUI">Next</span> button after completing each step, sometimes it is
useful to go back to previous steps, make different choices, and proceed forward
again, using the <span class="GUI">Next</span> button or the Guide.  These more
complex forms of navigation are described in this topic.</p>

<h2>The Guide</h2>

<p>The Guide represents the Prime Structure Prediction workflow as a series of
buttons corresponding to steps. 
</p>

<p>Your current step location is highlighted in the Guide.  Clicking on an
available step button in the Guide brings you to that step.  If a step is not
yet available, its button appears dimmed. Available steps include those you have
already passed through in the current run, plus the step immediately beyond your
current location -- your next step.)</p>

<p>Searches and jobs cannot be launched by clicking the steps in the Guide,
which is a display and navigation tool.  To launch actions pertaining to a step,
click the appropriate buttons within the step panel.</p>

<h2>Navigation</h2>

<p>There are several situations in which you might find it necessary to navigate
to a previous step. For example, if you chose a particular template in Find
Homologs and then after building the structure decide that you want to try and
build on a different template, you can navigate back to Find Homologs and choose
a different homolog.  Since you may want to compare your new results with those
produced with the previous template, it is recommended that the workflows using
the different templates be saved as different runs.  Select <span
class="GUI">Save As</span> from the <span class="GUI">File</span> menu.  This
will create a copy of the current run, allowing you to select a new template and
build on it. You will then be able to compare results from each run.</p>

<p>If you have gone back to a previous step and changed your selections, when
you proceed to the next step, either with the <span class="GUI">Next</span>
button or the Guide, you are presented with three choices, in a dialog box:

<ul>
<li>If you want to proceed with the new selections and clear the original data
in the subsequent steps,  click <span class="GUI">Overwrite</span>.
</li>
<li>If you want to discard the changes you made in the previous step, and return
to the next step without changing the original data, click <span
class="GUI">Ignore Changes</span>. 
</li>
<li>If you want to go back to the previous step and not proceed forward, click
<span class="GUI">Cancel</span>. 
</li>
</ul>
