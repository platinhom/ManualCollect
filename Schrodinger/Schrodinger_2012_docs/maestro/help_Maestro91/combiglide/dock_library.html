<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
In this step, you run the jobs that perform the library docking. You can also
export the best reagents and the top structures to the Project Table or to a file.
</p>

<a name="working"></a>
<h2>Working in the Dock Library Step</h2>

<p>
This step is the heart of the combinatorial screening process, where the docking
jobs are performed to screen out reagents and molecules that do not dock well.
The screening is performed in two stages. In the first stage, the attachments
defined by the reagents are added, one at a time, to the minimally capped
core. The resultant molecules, each of which has an attachment at a single
position, are docked, and molecules that do not dock well are eliminated. The
attachments added are taken from the expanded set of reagents, in which
different ionization states, conformers, or tautomers can be represented.
</p>
<p>The reduced set of attachments for each position is then combined and scored
with an intermediate scoring function, and the top scoring molecules with all
attachments in place are then docked. This second stage can result in the
elimination of further reagents.</p>

<p>The two stages can be run in the same job, or run separately. The choice of
how to run the stages is made in the <span class="GUI">Dock</span> dialog box,
which opens when you click <span class="GUI">Dock</span>. </p>

<p>As the processing of each set of reagents finishes, the results are posted in
the <span class="GUI">Single position results</span> table.
If QikProp is available, it is run for the completed structures, and the QikProp
properties are added to the run.
</p>

<p>Once the results are available, you can add them to the Project Table or
export them to a file. The structures from both stages are sorted by their GlideScores.
Singly-substituted structures or completed structures are added to the Project
Table as entry groups, with QikProp properties if these are available. For the
singly-substituted structures, all poses from the selected number of reagents
are exported.</p>

<p><b>To add or export a set of singly-substituted structures:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Select the table row for the reagent type.</li>
<li>Enter the number of reagents in the
<span class="GUI">Top <i>n</i> reagents</span> text box.</li>
<li>(Optional) If you want to include the receptor, select
<span class="GUI">Include receptor</span>.</li>
<li>Click <span class="GUI">Add to Project Table</span> or
<span class="GUI">Export</span>.</li>
<li>If you are exporting to a file, navigate to the directory, enter the file
name, and click <span class="GUI">Export</span>.</li>
</ol>

<p><b>To add or export a set of completed molecules:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Enter the number of structures in the
<span class="GUI">Top <i>n</i> structures</span> text box.</li>
<li>(Optional) If you want to include the receptor, select
<span class="GUI">Include receptor</span>.</li>
<li>Click <span class="GUI">Add to Project Table</span> or
<span class="GUI">Export</span>.</li>
<li>If you are exporting to a file, navigate to the directory, enter the file
name, and click <span class="GUI">Export</span>.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you have only one attachment, the normal workflow is not relevant because
there are no combinations to be made. Instead, you can run an &quot;enumerate
and dock&quot; job, in which the entire library is enumerated and docked.</p>

<h2>Dock Library Step Features</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="#feature1"><span class="GUI">Dock</span> and <span
class="GUI">Cancel</span> buttons</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature3"><span class="GUI">Reagent retention</span>
table</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature4"><span class="GUI">Single position
results</span> section</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature5"><span class="GUI">Combinatorial
results</span> section</a></li>
</ul>

<a name="feature1"></a>
<h3>Dock and Cancel Buttons</h3>

<p>These buttons run or cancel the docking jobs that result in the
combinatorial library. The <span class="GUI">Dock</span> button opens the <span
class="GUI">Dock</span> dialog box, in which you can set up the type of docking
job and select options for that job. Clicking <span class="GUI">Start</span> in
the <span class="GUI">Dock</span> dialog box starts the job. </p>

<p>The <span class="GUI">Cancel</span> button cancels the current docking
job, on clicking <span class="GUI">OK</span> in a confirmation dialog box. If
you are running the combinatorial docking job, and the single-positions job has
already finished, the results of the single-positions job are retained.
</p>

<a name="feature3"></a>
<h3>Reagent retention table</h3>
<p>
This table presents statistics on the reagents that survive the various
docking stages. The table is noneditable. You can select a single row for
exporting reagents. The table columns are as follows:
</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td><span class="GUI">Name</span></td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>Attachment position label</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span class="GUI">Reagent File</span></td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>Name (minus extension) of the file that contains the reagents for the specified position.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span class="GUI">Reagents</span></td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>Number of reagents in the original reagent file. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span class="GUI">Single</span></td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>Number of reagents from this file that survived the single-side-chain
analysis. This column is updated as the single-position docking jobs finish. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span class="GUI">Comb</span></td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>Number of reagents from this file that survived the combinatorial screening.
This number includes all reagents that contributed to any structure that docked
well.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h3>Single Position Results Section</h3>
<p>This section presents results of the single-position docking stage and
provides tools to export the docked structures. The name and reagent file
for the position selected in the <span class="GUI">Reagent
retention</span> table is displayed at the top of the section. </p>
