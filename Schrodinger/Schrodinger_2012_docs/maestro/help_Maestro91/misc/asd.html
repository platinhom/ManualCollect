<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The <span class="GUI">Atom Selection</span> dialog box (<span
class="GUI">ASD</span>) allows you to select atoms based on various
properties. It allows for rapid specification of atoms and supports construction
of complicated groupings.</p>

<p>You can define selection criteria by entering a text-based Atom Specification
Language (<a href="asl.html">ASL</a>) expression directly, or by choosing
options in the dialog box. </p>

<p>The <span class="GUI">ASD</span> is organized into categories: atom, residue,
molecule, chain, entry, substructure notation, and set. Each category contains a
list of properties and values available for selection. A selection is defined by
choosing a property and values for that property. The selection can then be
added, removed, or intersected with other selections.  The results are displayed
in an ASL expression in the <span class="GUI">ASL</span> text box.  Each new
step modifies the ASL expression and updates the markers in the Workspace,
allowing you to preview the selection before proceeding with the task.</p>

<p>Additional features include specifying atoms by proximity and creating named
sets.</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Atom Selection Dialog Box</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Atom Selection</span> dialog box, do one of the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Click the common objects button in any picking tools section in any panel
and choose <span class="GUI">Select</span>.
</p>
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/asl_gizmo_shortcut.png" />
</li>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Select</span> from the <span
class="GUI">Select</span> button menu on the <span class="GUI">Edit</span>
toolbar.
</p>
<img src="../images/MaestroToolbarIcons/ws_A.png" />
</li>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Edit &rarr; Select Atoms &rarr; Select</span>.
</p></li>
</ul>

<a name="using"></a>
<h2>Using the Atom Selection Dialog Box</h2>

<p>To select an atom group defined by a category:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Open the tab for the desired category. </p></li>
<li><p>Select a property from the list on the left. </p>
<p>The center portion of the tab is updated to provide the appropriate tools for
selecting a value for the property. Depending on the property type, you then
enter the desired value, select an option, choose from a list, or pick atoms in
the Workspace. After you have made your choice, the selected atoms are marked in
the Workspace with purple markers, if <span class="GUI">Show Markers</span> 
is selected. (If the choice was made by typing into a text box, you must click
<span class="GUI">Update Markers</span> to see the purple markers for the
selection.)</p></li>
<li><p>Then you can either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click <span class="GUI">Add</span> to include the atoms.</li>
<li>Click <span class="GUI">Subtract</span> to exclude the atoms (select everything
<i>except</i> these atoms).</li>
</ul>
<p>The markers change to light blue, the ASL expression for this atom group is
displayed in the <span class="GUI">ASL</span> text box below, and the number of
matching atoms is displayed in the status line near the bottom of the
panel. This is the <i>current selection</i>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>For example, place a molecule in the Workspace. In the <span
class="GUI">ASD</span>, open the <span class="GUI">Atom</span> tab, select <span
class="GUI">Atom Number In Entry</span> from the list, type in 1-10 in the <span
class="GUI">Atom Number In Entry</span> text box, click <span class="GUI">Update
Markers</span>, then click <span class="GUI">Add</span> and click <span
class="GUI">OK</span>.</p>

<p>You can also augment or limit the selection by further criteria:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Define another atom group by selecting a property (from another category,
if you wish) and choosing the values of that property.</p></li>
<li><p>Then you can do any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click <span class="GUI">Add</span> to add these new atoms to the selection.</li>
<li>Click <span class="GUI">Subtract</span> to subtract these new atoms from the
selection.</li>
<li>Click <span class="GUI">Intersect</span> to make the selection consist of the
atoms that are in both the current selection (blue) and the new atom group (purple).
This is the intersection of the two sets.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>For example, in the <span class="GUI">Atom</span> tab, select <span
class="GUI">Element</span> from the property list, select <span
class="GUI">C</span> from the <span class="GUI">Element</span> list, then click
<span class="GUI">Intersect</span>. Only the carbon atoms that were in the
original list are in the new list. </p>

<p>By repeating this process, you can build up a complex ASL expression that
selects just the atoms you want. The order in which you make the various
selections of groups of atoms to add is important: the ASL expression is built
up sequentially.</p>

<h2>Atom Selection Dialog Box Features</h2>

<p>The <span class="GUI">Atom Selection</span> dialog box contains seven category tabs:
<span class="GUI">Atom</span>, <span class="GUI">Reside</span>,
<span class="GUI">Molecule</span>, <span class="GUI">Chain</span>,
<span class="GUI">Entry</span>, <span class="GUI">Substructure</span>, and
<span class="GUI">Set</span>. Each tab consists of three sections.
The left section contains a list of properties for that category. When you select a property,
a set of tools is displayed in the center section. On the right are buttons for combining the new
selection with the current selection. These tools become available when you have selected a property
value.</p>

<li><a href="#feature2">Property Value Selection Tools</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature3">Combining Tools</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature4">Markers</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature5">Proximity</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature6">Create Set</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature7">Editing Tools</a></li>
</ul>

<a name="feature1"></a>
<h3>Category Tabs</h3>

<p>Each tab represents a category of properties by which you can select atoms. </p>
<div style="margin-left: 20">
<p><span class="GUI">Atom</span>: Choose individual <i>atoms</i> that have
the selected property and value.</p>
<p><span class="GUI">Residue</span>: Choose all atoms in <i>residues</i>
that have the selected property and value.</p>
<p><span class="GUI">Molecule</span>: Choose all atoms in <i>molecules</i>
that have the selected property and value.</p>
<p><span class="GUI">Chain</span>: Choose all atoms in <i>chains</i> that
have the selected property and value.</p>
<p><span class="GUI">Entry</span>: Choose all atoms in <i>entries</i> that
have the selected property and value.</p>
<p><span class="GUI">Substructure</span>: Choose all atoms in the
selected <i>substructure</i> (SMARTS pattern or Maestro substructure).</p>
<p><span class="GUI">Set</span>: Choose all atoms in the selected <i>set</i>.</p>  </div>

<a name="feature2"></a>
<h3>Property Value Selection Tools</h3>

<p>There are three kinds of property value selection tools. </p>

<ul>
<li><b>Lists:</b> For properties whose values are a name, such as Element, you
can select one or more members from a list. Multiple members can be selected
from the list using the standard conventions for multiple selection, using the
<span class="GUI">SHIFT</span> and <span class="GUI">CTRL</span> keys
when you click.<p></p></li>
<li><b>Text boxes:</b> For properties that have numerical values, such as atom
number or partial charge, you can enter the value in the text box. Below the
text box are examples of the syntax for the selection and the range of possible
values. When this kind of selection tool is available, the <span class="GUI">Update Markers</span> button also becomes active. When you
click this button, the text is parsed and the corresponding atoms are
marked. <br />
<br />
<b>Warning:</b> If you press <span class="GUI">ENTER</span> after typing
the values, the default action, <span class="GUI">Add</span> is
performed.<p></p></li>
<li><b>Options:</b> For properties that are defined by some kind of
classification, such as hydrogen atoms that are polar or non-polar, you can
select them by clicking the appropriate option.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Note:</b> Only the values available in the displayed structure are listed.</p>

<a name="feature3"></a>
<h3>Combining Tools</h3>

<p>Each tab has three buttons on the right that can be used to combine the new atom group with
the current selection. </p>
<ul>
<li><span class="GUI">Add</span>: adds the new atom group to the current
selection, using a logical OR operation on the ASL expression. The resulting
selection includes all atoms that are in either the new atom group or the
current selection.  This is the default action, which is performed if you press
<span class="GUI">ENTER</span>.<p></p></li>
<li><span class="GUI">Subtract</span>: subtracts the new atom group from
the current selection, using a logical AND NOT operation on the ASL
expression. The resulting selection includes all atoms that are in the current
selection but not in the new atom group. (If this is the first operation, the
default current selection is "all".)<p></p></li>
<li><span class="GUI">Intersect</span>: takes only the common members of
the new atom group and the current selection, using a logical AND operation on
the ASL expression. The resulting selection includes only the atoms that are in
both the new atom group and the current selection.</Li></li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to these three buttons, the <span class="GUI">Invert</span>
button at the bottom of the panel inverts the entire current selection, using a
logical NOT operation.  All atoms that were selected are unselected, and all
atoms that were unselected are selected.</p>

<a name="feature4"></a>
<h3>Markers</h3>

<p>If <span class="GUI">Show Markers</span> is selected, markers for both the
new atom group and the current selection are displayed in the Workspace. Markers
for the new atom group are purple and are offset from the atoms slightly. Markers for
the current selection are light blue. If you are selecting a range of property values
by entering them in a text box, click <span class="GUI">Update Markers</span>
to see the markers for the new atom group.</p>

<a name="feature5"></a>
<h3>Proximity</h3>

<p>The <span class="GUI">Proximity</span> button opens the
<a href="proximitydb.html"><span class="GUI">Proximity</span> dialog
box</a>, in which you can select atoms based on their distance from the atoms
defined by the current selection (the source atoms). You can specify the
distance in angstroms or in terms of the number of bonds. If the boundary for
inclusion intersects a molecule or a residue, you can choose to include the
entire molecule or residue using the <span class="GUI">Fill</span>
buttons. You can either include or exclude the source atoms in the
selection. The <span class="GUI">Update Markers</span> button updates the
markers for the proximity selection so that you can view the selection in the
Workspace before accepting it.</p>

<p> If you want to ensure that molecules and residues are filled,
but no residue or molecule crosses the boundary, you cannot use the
<span class="GUI">Proximity</span> dialog box directly. You need to select the
opposite of what you want, then invert the selection.</p>

<p>For example, to select all residues that lie strictly outside a
10&nbsp;&Aring; boundary of the current selection:</p>

<ol>
<li>Click <span class="GUI">Proximity</span> to open the
<span class="GUI">Proximity</span> dialog box. </li>
<li>Under <span class="GUI">Proximity</span>, select <span class="GUI">Within</span>, enter 10 in the text box, and select <span class="GUI">Angstroms</span>.</li>
<li>Under <span class="GUI">Fill</span>, select <span class="GUI">Residues</span>.</li>
<li>Deselect <span class="GUI">Exclude source</span> to include the source
atoms.</li>
<li>Click <span class="GUI">OK</span> to select these atoms. The selection
now includes all atoms within the boundary and all atoms that are part of
residues that cross the boundary.</li>
<li>Click <span class="GUI">Invert</span> to select all atoms in complete
residues that are strictly beyond the chosen boundary.</li>
</ol>

<a name="feature6"></a>
<h3>Create Set</h3>
<p>The <span class="GUI">Create Set</span> button opens a dialog box that
enables you to name and store the existing ASL expression for use as a set definition.
The sets created in this manner are the same as sets created with the <span class="GUI">Sets</span> panel, and can be selected in the <span class="GUI">Set</span> tab. These sets are automatically saved with the project and are restored when the project is opened again. </p>

<a name="feature7"></a>
<h3>Editing Tools</h3>

<p>Several editing tools make it easier to create your own ASL expressions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="GUI">ASL</span> text box: You can type ASL expressions
directly into the <span class="GUI">ASL</span> text box. The
hand-edited expressions are considered part of the last operation performed with
the mouse and can be undone and redone as part of that operation,
but cannot be undone or redone separately.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">All</span>: Selects all atoms in the Workspace.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Undo</span>: Undoes the last action. You can undo
multiple operations with repeated clicks on the <span class="GUI">Undo</span> button.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Redo</span>: Redoes the last action.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Clear</span>: Clears the <span class="GUI">ASL</span>
text box.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Invert</span>: Inverts the expression in the
<span class="GUI">ASL</span> text box, so that those atoms are NOT
selected.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Previous</span>: Recalls the last expression used.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Selection</span>: Replaces the current expression with an
expression for the Workspace selection.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Atom Num</span>: Converts the expression to list each
atom explicitly by atom number.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Res Num</span>: Converts the expression to list each
residue explicitly by residue number.</p></li>
</ul>
