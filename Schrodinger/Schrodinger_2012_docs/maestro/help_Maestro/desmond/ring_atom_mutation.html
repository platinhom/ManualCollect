<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>In this panel, you can set up and run FEP calculations for the mutation of a
ring atom in a ligand. The panel is designed to make setting up FEP jobs as
easy as possible: most of the computational details, such as setting the force
field parameters, solvation, relaxation of the system, and setting the FEP
simulations, are taken care of automatically.
</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Ring Atom Mutation by FEP Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Ring Atom Mutation by FEP</span> panel:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Applications &rarr; Desmond &rarr; 
Ring Atom Mutation by FEP</span>.</p></li>
</ul>

<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Ring Atom Mutation by FEP Panel</h2> 

<p>Ring atom mutation changes a selected ring atom to a different atom type while
preserving the hybridization of the atom. FEP simulations are automatically
prepared, performed, and analyzed to yield the free energy difference between
the mutant and the original molecule for each of the selected atom types.</p> 

<p><span class="HB">To run a ring atom mutation job:</span></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Include in the Maestro Workspace the system that contains the ligand to
be mutated, the receptor protein (optional), and any other key molecules of the
system.</p>
<p>You can use an existing model system that may, for example, include a
membrane. If you do, note that the SPC water model is used in the FEP
simulations, regardless of the choice made for your model system. This step can
be performed prior to opening the panel.</p></li>

<li><p>Select <span class="GUI">Pick the ring atom</span>, then pick the
ligand atom to be mutated in the Workspace.
</p>
<p>When the atom is picked, it is rendered in ball-and-stick, and the ligand is
colored with green carbons.</p> 
</li>

<li><p>In the <span class="GUI">Mutation targets</span> table, select the
targets that you want to use to replace the original ring atom by selecting
their table rows.</p>
<p> Use shift-click and control-click to select multiple 
table rows. You can view the mutated ligand by clicking in the 
<span class="GUI">View</span> column. </p>
</li>

<li><p>(Optional) If you want to adjust the structure or add a functional group
to the mutant, use the adjustment and build tools to make the desired changes to
the mutated ligand structure. 
</p></li>

<li><p>In the <span class="GUI">Plan calculation</span> tab, choose the 
calculation types.</p>
<p>The choices will depend on whether you want to calculate relative binding free
energies (complex and solvent) or relative solvation free energies (solvent and
vacuum). 
</p></li>

<li><p>Choose the FEP protocol you want to use for each calculation type
from the <span class="GUI">FEP protocol</span> option menu.</p></li>  

<li><p>Set the buffer size for the periodic box. The buffer size is ignored if
you use a prepared model system as input.
</p></li>

<li><p>Set the time used for the actual simulation (following any initial
simulation) at each lambda point. 
</p></li>

<li><p>Set the temperature for the simulation.
</p></li>

<li><p>Click <span class="GUI">Start</span>, set the job parameters in the 
<span class="GUI">Start</span> dialog box, and click <span
class="GUI">Start</span> in the dialog box to run the job.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Ring Atom Mutation by FEP Panel Features</h2> 

<p>This panel has two tabs and a set of action buttons. 
The Define Perturbation tab and the action buttons are described below.
The Plan Calculation tab is described in a separate topic, as its contents are
common to several FEP calculation panels.
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#feature1"><span class="GUI">Define Perturbation</span> tab</a></li>
<li><a href="plan_calculation_tab.html"><span class="GUI">Plan Calculation</span> tab</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature2">Action buttons</a></li>
</ul>

<a name="feature1"></a>
<h3>Define Perturbation tab</h3>

<p>This tab displays a series of steps to follow. Each step has text describing
the task for the step. </p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> involves displaying the ligand, the receptor, and any other
important molecules in the Workspace.
</p>
<p><b>Step 2</b> involves picking the ring atom for the functional group
substitution. It has a single option, <span class="GUI">Pick the ring
atom</span>. When this option is selected, you can pick an atom on the ligand in
the Workspace. When the atom is picked, it is renedered in ball-and-stick, and
the ligand is colored with green carbons.
Once focus is returned to the panel, this option is deselected. You cannot pick
substituted ring atoms. 
</p><a name="feature2"></a>

<p><b>Step 3</b> involves selecting the targets that will replace the
ring atom. This step is performed using the <span class="GUI">Fragment 
library</span> table. The targets that will be used are the targets that you
select in the table. To view the ligand with a particular target replacing the
substitution group, click in the <span class="GUI">View</span> column.</p>
<p>The button in the <span class="GUI">Reset</span> column resets the
substituted ligand to its initial geometry, if you have done any adjustments.
You should not make modifications to the ligand core or other molecules
in the system. 
</p>

<a name="feature2"></a>
<h3>Action buttons</h3>
<p>At the bottom left of the panel are three buttons that perform various
actions:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Start</span>&mdash;Opens the 
<span class="GUI">Start</span> dialog box, in which you can set the job
parameters such as job name, host, number of CPUs, and so on, and then start the
job.
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Write</span>&mdash;Writes the input files for the job
but does not start the job. Opens a dialog box in which you can specify a job
name, which is used to name the files. This capability is useful if you want to
change the FEP protocol. 
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Reset</span>&mdash;Resets the entire panel to its
initial state. This includes clearing the Workspace. If you want to use the same
structures, you will have to redisplay them befor proceeding.
</p></li>
</ul>
