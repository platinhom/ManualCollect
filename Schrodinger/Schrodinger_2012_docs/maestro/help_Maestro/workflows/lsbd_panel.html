<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
This panel is used to generate ligand and structure-based descriptors for a
structure-based QSAR model of ligand binding to a receptor. These descriptors
can be used as input to the model-generation facility in Strike.
</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Ligand and Structure-Based Descriptors Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Ligand and Structure-Based Descriptors</span>
panel:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Workflows &rarr; Ligand and Structure-Based
Descriptors</span>.</p></li>
</ul>

<a name="using"></a>
<h2>Using the Ligand and Structure-Based Descriptors Panel</h2>

<p>
This panel provides a convenient interface to several Schr&ouml;dinger programs,
which are used to generate descriptors for a QSAR model. The focus is on
generating descriptors for a set of ligands that are docked to a receptor.
Three of the programs, Liaison, Prime MM-GBSA, and the Embrace module of
MacroModel, operate on the ligand and the receptor. The other two, QikProp and
Ligparse, operate on the ligand only. The descriptors extracted from Liaison,
Prime MM-GBSA, and Embrace are energetic properties related to ligand
binding. QikProp generates ADME properties, and LigParse generates
structure-based properties such as functional group counts.
</p>

<p>To set up a calculation, you must select a receptor and a source of ligands.
The receptor and ligands can come from a pose viewer file, or from separate
files, or from the current project. The selections are made in the <span
class="GUI">Source of Ligands and Receptor</span> section.
</p>

<p>After choosing a receptor and ligands, you can choose the descriptors you
want to generate. For each of the five programs, there is an option in the
<span class="GUI">Select descriptors to generate</span> section of the
panel. The programs are run with default options that were chosen to produce
reasonable descriptors. If you want to change any of these options or change
some of the job options, click the <span class="GUI">Advanced Options</span>
button, and make your choices in the <span class="GUI">Ligand and
Structure-Based Descriptors - Advanced Options</span> dialog box.
The settings available in this dialog box are a limited set of the full range of
settings, designed to provide useful descriptors for a QSAR model. </p>

<p>If you want to clear all custom settings and return to the default settings,
click <span class="GUI">Reset</span> in the <span class="GUI">Ligand and
Structure-Based Descriptors</span> panel. The settings for all programs are
returned to their defaults.</p>

<p>When you have made all your selections, you can click 
<span class="GUI">Start</span> to run the jobs, or click 
<span class="GUI">Write</span> to write the input files without running the
jobs.  When you click <span class="GUI">Write</span>, the settings that you made
are saved, and can be retrieved by clicking <span class="GUI">Read</span>.  When
you click <span class="GUI">Start</span>, the <span class="GUI">Start</span>
dialog box opens, in which you can make job settings. The input files are
written, the directories set up for each kind of job, and the jobs are
started.</p>
<p>
The main master job and the master jobs for each program run on the local host,
even if you selected a different host to run the calculations on. Jobs for
different programs are run concurrently if the host selection and number of
processors allows it (for example, if the host is a queue). Jobs for individual
programs can be distributed over multiple processors if the program allows
it. Settings for distributing individual programs can be made in the <span
class="GUI">Advanced Options</span> panel: these settings override those made in
the <span class="GUI">Start</span> dialog box. There is one restriction on host
selection: the launch directory (current working directory) must be mounted on
all hosts to which jobs are submitted.
</p>

<p>The results are collected as a set of descriptors in a <tt>.csv</tt> file,
and the properties are merged with the input ligand structures in the output
file, <i>jobname</i><code>-out.mae</code>. The output from the Prime MM-GBSA,
Liaison, and Embrace calculations is also returned, in
.<i>jobname</i><code>-</code><i>product</i><code>-out.mae</code>.
If you chose entries from the Project Table, the descriptors are imported into
the project when the calculations finish. </p>

<h3>Descriptors To Generate Section</h3>

<p>In this section you select the calculations that you want to run to generate
descriptors, and set options for these calculations.
</p>

<dl>

<a name="feature3.1"></a>
<dt>Descriptor type options</dt>
<dd><p>Select the option for each of the descriptor types you want to calculate.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature3.2"></a>

run. The options for each program are in a separate tab.
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Liaison</span>&mdash;The job options are described in
brief in the <a href="../liaison/liaison_panel.html"><span class="GUI">Liaison
Panel</span> topic</a>. Constraints can be set by choosing from a menu
that supplies a set of predetermined distances for restrained and frozen shells.
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Embrace</span>&mdash;The options for the potential and
minimization are described in the MacroModel 
<a href="../macromodel/potential_tab.html"><span class="GUI">Potential</span>
tab</a> and <a href="../macromodel/energy_minimization.html#mini"><span

Constraints can be set by choosing from a menu that supplies a set of
predetermined distances for restrained, frozen, and ignored shells.
</p></li>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Prime MM-GBSA</span>&mdash;The <span
class="GUI">Settings</span> section provides two options, for calculating ligand
strain energies, and for using partial 
charges read in as properties with the input ligand (rather than those
calculated by the force field). The <span class="GUI">Protein
Flexibility</span> section contains an option menu from which you can choose
various ranges relative to the first input ligand for which protein atoms are
allowed to move.

<dl>

<a name="feature4.1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Start</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Opens the <span class="GUI">Start</span> dialog box, in which you can
select the host, set the job name and number of CPUs, and start the job. The
launch directory must be mounted on the host that you select for the job. The
calculations are run under Job Control, and can be monitored in the <span
class="GUI">Monitor</span> panel.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature4.2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Read</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Read settings for all calculation types from a previous run. Opens a
dialog box in which you can navigate to and choose an input file,
which has a file extension of <tt>.inp</tt>.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature4.3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Write</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Write the input files for the calculations, but do not start the
jobs. Writing the files enables you to edit the input files, but you must then
