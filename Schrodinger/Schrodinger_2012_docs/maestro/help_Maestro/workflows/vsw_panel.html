<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
The <span class="GUI">Virtual Screening Workflow</span> panel enables you to set
up and run jobs to screen ligands against one or more targets. The workflow
includes ligand preparation, filtering, and up to three docking stages with
Glide, progressing from HTVS to SP to XP docking.
</p>

<h2>Opening the Virtual Screening Workflow Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Virtual Screening Workflow</span> panel, do one
of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Workflows &rarr; Virtual Screening
Workflow</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Tasks &rarr; Docking &rarr; 
Virtual Screening Workflow</span>.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Using the Virtual Screening Workflow Panel</h2> 

<p>This panel can be used to run the entire sequence of jobs in the 
Virtual Screening Workflow. The panel sets up the input files for LigPrep, QikProp, 
and Glide ligand docking and submits them to the selected host in order. 
</p>

<p>When you run the workflow, you can pregenerate Glide grids for the desired
receptors, or generate grids from the Workspace structure.  For more information
on generating Glide grids, see the <a href="../glide/receptor_grid_generation.html">Glide Receptor
Grid Generation Panel</a> topic.</p>

<p>The ligand files for the workflow can consist of 2D structures or 3D
structures. If you supply 2D structures, you must run the ligand preparation
part of the workflow to convert the structures to 3D for docking. This stage
runs a LigPrep job, with the standard options for most parts of the LigPrep
process. You can control some of these options, but if you want to use other
options, you should run LigPrep on the ligands independently. For more
information, see the <a href="../ligprep/ligprep.html">LigPrep Panel</a> topic,
or the <a href="../../../ligprep/ligprep_user_manual.pdf"
target="pdfmanuals"><i>LigPrep User Manual</i></a>.
Because LigPrep does not sample conformations of 7-membered or larger rings, you
can run a MacroModel job after LigPrep to sample these rings. 
</p> 

<p>Prefiltering of the ligands can also be performed as part of the workflow. If
you want to use the Lipinski Rule option, you must run QikProp to obtain the
required properties. You can run QikProp as part of the workflow, regardless of
the ligand source. If you have already run QikProp, you do not need to run it
again. The reactive groups filter is a predefined filter that removes ligands
with these groups. If you want to specify a custom filter, you can provide an
input file for  <code>ligfilter</code>, which will then filter the structures,
or set up the filter in a graphical interface.  You can also choose whether to
filter the ligands before or after preparation. For more information 
on <code>ligfilter</code>, see 
<a href="../../maestro_user_manual.pdf#nameddest=M22.8.newlink.ligfilter"
target="pdfmanuals">Appendix D of the <i>Maestro User Manual</i></a>
</p>

<p>The full workflow includes three docking stages. The first stage performs
HTVS docking.  The ligands that are retained are then passed to the next stage,
which performs SP docking; the survivors of this stage are passed on to the
third stage, which performs XP docking. At each stage you can decide how many
ligands are kept, and whether the ionization and tautomeric states of each
ligand are kept.</p>

<p>The stages of the job are managed by a master job, and the work can be
divided into subjobs, which can in turn be distributed over multiple processors.
The master job runs locally, but you can specify hosts to run the ligand
preparation (LigPrep) and grid generation and docking (Glide) and the number of
processors to use on each host, in the <span class="GUI">Start</span> dialog
box. For docking you can specify the number of subjobs, in the <span
class="GUI">Separate into N subjobs</span> text box, or select <span
class="GUI">Adjust</span> to automatically adjust the number of subjobs so that
each takes between 1 and 10 hours.  For effective load balancing of a
distributed job, the number of subjobs should be several times the number of
processors.</p>

<p>The workflow is intended to be robust, so that if a subjob fails, the master
job attempts to rerun the job a few times before quitting. </p>

<p>If you want to incorporate the results in to the Maestro project, you can
choose <span class="GUI">Append new entries</span> from the option menu in the
<span class="GUI">Output</span> section of the <span class="GUI">Start</span>
dialog box.
</p>

<p>You can dock the ligands to multiple receptors in the workflow, and provide
an offset for the GlideScore so that the results from different receptors can be
compared. If you want to merge more results later, you can do this with the
script <code>$SCHRODINGER/utilities/glide_ensemble_merge</code>. Use the
<code>-h</code> option for the syntax of this script.</p>

<h2>Virtual Screening Workflow Panel Features</h2> 

<p>The main part of the <span class="GUI">Virtual Screening Workflow</span>
panel  consists of five tabs for setting up screening jobs. These tabs are
described in separate topics.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="vsw_input_tab.html"><span class="GUI">Input</span> 
Tab</a></li>
<li><a href="vsw_filtering_tab.html"><span class="GUI">Filtering</span> 
Tab</a></li>
<li><a href="vsw_preparation_tab.html"><span class="GUI">Preparation</span> 
Tab</a></li>
<li><a href="vsw_receptors_tab.html"><span class="GUI">Receptors</span> 
Tab</a></li>
<li><a href="vsw_docking_tab.html"><span class="GUI">Docking</span> 
Tab</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Below the tabs is a row of buttons.
The <span class="GUI">Start</span> button opens the
<a href="../misc/job_start_db.html"><span class="GUI">Start</span> dialog
box</a>, in which you set up the actual job; the <span class="GUI">Write</span>
button writes the input file but does not start the job, and the <span
class="GUI">Reset</span> button resets all settings to their default values. </p>
