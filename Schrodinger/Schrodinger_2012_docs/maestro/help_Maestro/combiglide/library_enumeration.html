<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>This panel provides tools to develop a library of ligands
from a core structure to which molecular fragments called <i>attachments</i> are
added in user-specified positions. The attachments replace an existing group in
the core structure. </p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Combinatorial Library Enumeration Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Combinatorial Library Enumeration</span>
panel:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Applications &rarr; CombiGlide &rarr;
Combinatorial Library Enumeration</span> in the main window.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Tasks &rarr; Library Design</span> in the main
window.</p></li>
</ul>

<a name="using"></a>
<h2>Using the Combinatorial Library Enumeration Panel</h2>

<p>The combinatorial library enumeration is carried out by substitution of
attachments on the core structure with fragments from the reagent
structures. For both the core and the reagents, the bonds to be broken must be
designated. The fragments from the
reagents are then attached to the core at the site of the broken bond.
This process can be regarded as &quot;growing&quot; the new attachment onto the
core in place of the old attachment, and the bond that is replaced
(with its attached atoms) is called the <i>grow bond</i>. These bonds
are not necessarily the bonds that are broken and formed in the real
chemical reaction, but represent a means of varying the attachments to
a core structure that might include part of the real reagent. </p>

<p>To generate a combinatorial library, you must have a core structure whose
attachments you want to replace, and a set of reagent files that define the
replacements. For information on preparing reagent files, see the
<a href="reagent_preparation.html">Reagent Preparation Panel</a>
topic.</p>

<p>When you first open the <span class="GUI">Combinatorial Library
Enumeration</span> panel, <span class="GUI">Pick molecule</span> is
selected in the <span class="GUI">Core structure</span> section, and
most other controls are unavailable. After you have defined a core structure,
the other controls become available.</p>

<p><b>To define the core structure:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Ensure that the structure is displayed in the Workspace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click on an atom in the core structure.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>After you pick the core structure, <span class="GUI">Pick
molecule</span> is deselected, and the
<span class="GUI">Pick</span> option is selected in the <span class="GUI">Pick to define an attachment</span> section. The core
molecule is now defined, and you can define the positions of the
attachments.</p>

<p><b>To define an attachment:</b>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Pick two atoms that define the position of one of the attachments,
the atom that is kept first, then the atom that is deleted.</p>
<p>A turquoise arrow is displayed over the bond, and the
<span class="GUI">Select Reagent File</span> dialog box opens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the appropriate reagent file, and click OK</p>
<p>The reagent files have a <code>.bld</code> extension: they are
Maestro-format files that have special information for the Maestro builder,
which does the library enumeration. The dialog box closes, and the
attachment is listed in the <span class="GUI">Attachments</span>
table. The size of the library with the current set of attachments is given in
the lower portion of the panel. The arrowhead changes to a sphere and the color
changes to gold.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you choose the wrong location for an attachment position, you can delete it by
selecting it in the table and clicking <span class="GUI">Delete
Attachment</span>. If you simply attached the wrong file, you can select the
attachment in the table, and click the <span class="GUI">Browse</span> button below the table to select the
correct file.</p>

<p><b>To start the library enumeration job:</b></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Click <span class="GUI">Start.</span></p>
<p>The <span class="GUI">Start</span> dialog box is displayed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Change the output directory, if necessary, choose a host, set the job name,
and click <span class="GUI">Start.</span></p>
<p>The host you choose should have temporary storage of about 3 to 4 times the
size of the library. This space is required for the untangling and minimization
of the library members.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The job takes about 45-60 seconds per output structure, because each structure is
minimized. The library is written to a Maestro file named
<i>jobname</i><tt>.mae</tt>.</p>

<a name="feature1.1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Pick molecule</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>When selected, allows you to pick a molecule in the Workspace for the core
structure. The molecule you pick should be a 3D, minimized structure.
Picking a core molecule deletes any attachment data.
This option is selected by default when you open the panel and no core molecule
has been picked. After picking, the Workspace is cleared and the picked molecule
is displayed. Any changes you make to the structure of the molecule are not
saved in the run. If you make changes to the structure, you must pick the
molecule again to make it the core structure.
</p></dd>
