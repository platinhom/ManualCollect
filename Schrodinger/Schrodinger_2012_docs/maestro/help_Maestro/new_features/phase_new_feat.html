<h4>Pharmacophore Hypothesis Model Development</h4>

<li><p>The <span class="GUI">Develop Pharmacophore Model</span> panel has been
renamed to <span class="GUI">Develop Common Pharmacophore Hypotheses</span>. 
</p></li> 

<li><p>You can split a set of conformers into two sets by title. This is useful
when importing conformer sets that differ in their stereochemistry but
this difference is not detected. In this case, you can give a different title to
each set and then split the set by title. 
</p></li> 

<li><p>Conformational searches started from the <span class="GUI">Prepare
Ligands</span> step can be distributed across multiple processors. 
</p></li> 

<li><p>All ligands can be grouped, not just actives. Ligands in a group must
have the same pharm set membership. Ligands can be grouped by title. 
</p></li> 

<li><p>Excluded volumes can be created automatically from a receptor, from a set
of reference structures, and from a set of inactives and actives. These
capabilities are available from the <span class="GUI">Excluded Volumes</span>
dialog box. They provide interfaces to the <code>create_xvolReceptor</code>,
<code>create_xvolShell</code> and <code>create_xvolClash</code> utilities. 
The first replaces the former <span class="GUI">Receptor-Based Excluded
Volumes</span> dialog box. 
</p></li> 

<li><p>You can include the reference ligand automatically in the Workspace when
you include a hypothesis, with a new option.
</p></li> 

<li><p>Ligands that are not aligned to the hypothesis can be hidden in the
<span class="GUI">Alignments</span> table.
</p></li> 

<li><p>Some control over the QSAR training and test set automatic assignments
has been introduced. The pharm set actives and inactives can be included in the
training set, and the selection of ligands can be uniformly distributed across
ligand activities.
</p></li> 

<li><p>Hydrophobic site definitions have changed due to an improved
solvent-accessible surface area calculation. To use the new definitions, you
will have to re-run the pharmacophore model development.
</p></li> 

<h4>Database Management</h4>

<li><p>The new database design introduced in Suite 2012 is now the default. The
old database management and search utilities listed below are still available in
Suite 2012, but they will no longer be available after Suite 2012. </p>
<p>
<code>
$SCHRODINGER/phase_dbsearch<br/>
$SCHRODINGER/phase_fileSearch<br/>
$SCHRODINGER/phase_gridSearch<br/>
$SCHRODINGER/utilities/pharm_align_mol<br/>
$SCHRODINGER/utilities/phasedb_check<br/>
$SCHRODINGER/utilities/phasedb_confsites<br/>
$SCHRODINGER/utilities/phasedb_convert<br/>
$SCHRODINGER/utilities/phasedb_count_records<br/>
$SCHRODINGER/utilities/phasedb_export<br/>
$SCHRODINGER/utilities/phasedb_fetch_hits<br/>
$SCHRODINGER/utilities/phasedb_findmatches<br/>
$SCHRODINGER/utilities/phasedb_index<br/>

$SCHRODINGER/utilities/phasedb_match_keys<br/>
$SCHRODINGER/utilities/phasedb_props<br/>
$SCHRODINGER/utilities/phasedb_split_records<br/>
$SCHRODINGER/utilities/phasedb_subset<br/>
</code>
</p>
<p>The <span class="GUI">Generate Phase Database</span> and <span
class="GUI">Manage Phase Database</span> panels now use the new database
program, <code>phase_database</code>. If you try to open a database in an old
format in the <span class="GUI">Manage Phase Database</span> panel, a conversion
dialog box opens, in which you can choose to convert it to the new format.
</p>
</li> 

<li><p>The <a href="../phase/convert_phase_database.html"><span
class="GUI">Convert Phase Database</span> panel</a> is available from the 
<span class="GUI">Phase</span> submenu of the <span
class="GUI">Applications</span> menu. (Update 2)
</p></li> 

<li><p>You can import several files with <code>phase_database</code> by listing
them in a text file, which is passed as an argument to the <code>-i</code>
option.
</p></li> 

<li><p>You can replace existing records in the database with the
<code>-replace</code> option. Structures in the input file that don't exist in
the database are appended to the database. 
</p></li> 

<li><p>When using the <span class="GUI">-unique</span> option, duplicates that
are rejected are reported in the file <i>jobname</i><code>_reject.out</code>. 
</p></li> 

<li><p>Maximum topological distances between feature types can be added to the
database with the <code>-paths</code> option in <code>revise</code> mode. These
properties can be used to create subsets or filter hits in which the topological
distance is too large, for example (creating a U-shaped molecule). 
</p></li> 

<li><p>Input structure files can be imported either from the job submission host
(local files) or the job execution host (remote host). This allows you to create
or update a remote database with remote files.
</p></li> 


<h4>Hypotheses</h4>

<li><p>You can create hypotheses from a receptor and a ligand based on
complementary interactions, with the new utility <code>phase_complex</code>.
</p></li> 

<li><p>You can now run <code>create_hypoFiles</code> with an SD file input. 
</p></li> 

<li><p>You can create a distance file (<code>.dist</code>) from a coordinate
file (<code>.xyz</code>) with a new utility, convert_hypoXYZToDist.
</p></li> 

<li><p>The radius of an excluded volume can be specified in advance of picking,
with a new <span class="GUI">Radius</span> text box in the <span
class="GUI">Excluded Volumes</span> panel. (Update 2)
</p></li> 

<li><p>When creating a hypothesis manually, unused sites are displayed in a
darker color than sites that have been added to the hypothesis.
</p></li> 

<h4>Searching for Matches</h4>

<li><p>A new panel, <a href="../phase/simplified_pharmacophore_screening.html">
<span class="GUI">Simplified Pharmacophore Modeling and Screening</span></a> has
been added for basic screening of a set of compounds against a pharmacophore
hypothesis, which you can import or create in the panel.
</p></li>

<li><p>The <span class="GUI">Find Matches to Hypothesis</span> panel is now
<span class="GUI">Advanced Pharmacophore Screening</span>. 
</p></li> 

<li><p>The <span class="GUI">Advanced Pharmacophore Screening</span> panel
searches databases in the new format, with the new search program,
<code>phase_find_matches</code>. It also allows you to search files.  You can
run searches on the old database format from the command line.
</p></li> 

<li><p>The detection of hydrophobic sites is now based on an improved
calculation of the solvent-accessible surface area. To take advantage of the new
definitions for searching, you will have to copy the new feature file into your
database and regenerate the sites. You might find that the number of sites
changes with the new code. Likewise, you will have to regenerate sites on any
hypotheses for which you want to use the new definitions. 
</p></li> 

<li><p>When generating conformers during a search or searching a file, conformer
sets are separated by stereochemistry, by default. 
</p></li> 

<li><p>You can use included volumes to score and filter hits. This requires an
<span class="GUI">.ivol</span> file, which has the same format as an excluded
volumes file. You can turn this feature off, specify the weight in the fitness
score, and use a cutoff to filter out hits with too small an included volume
score, by using command options. 
</p></li> 

<li><p>Subsets can be specified with or without the <code>_phase.inp</code>
suffix, when passing arguments to database-related commands.
</p></li> 

<li><p>You can get more output in the log file from a search for matches by
selecting an option. From the command line, use <code>phase_find_matches</code>
with the <span class="GUI">-verbose</span> option.</p></li> 

<h4>Other New Features and Changes</h4>
<li><p>When running a shape search or a flexible alignment and aligning to
SMARTS patterns, you can determine the desired atom numbers with the
<code>-atoms</code> option to <code>phase_shape</code> or
<code>flex_align</code>. With this argument, the program reports the possible
atom mappings and exits without running the search or alignment.
</p></li> 

<li><p>In the options for <code>phase_shape</code> and <code>flex_align</code>,
the <code>pharm</code> argument to the <code>-atomTypes</code> option has been
changed to <code>qsar</code>, to avoid confusion with the <span
class="GUI">-pharm</span> option. The old <code>pharm</code> argument is still
accepted, but is replaced with <span class="GUI">qsar</span>. 
</p></li> 

<li><p>You can delete some or all ligands from the set when building QSAR
models. This makes it easier to change the model or create a new model.
</p></li> 

<li><p>You can specify the number of ligands to leave out in the leave-N-out
cross validation when building QSAR models. 
</p></li> 

<li><p>The contours of field-based QSAR models can be visualized as solid, mesh,
or dot surfaces. 
</p></li> 

<li><p>The error of prediction is shown in the results of building a QSAR model.
</p></li> 

<li><p>Partial charges from the input structures can be used in field-based QSAR
models. (Update 2)
</p></li>
