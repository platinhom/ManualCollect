<p>New features of the graphical tools that are distributed with
Schr&ouml;dinger Suite 2012 and are used in multiple products are listed below.
</p>

<ul>

<h4>2D Sketcher</h4>

<li><p>Functional groups can be added to a structure by typing in the functional
group name. 
</p></li> 

<li><p>Cleanup can be applied to an atom selection.
</p></li> 

<li><p>Structures that originated from a project entry in Maestro can be saved
to an existing project entry, or replace in the Workspace as a scratch entry.
</p></li> 

<li><p>Image resolution can be set when saving an image.
</p></li> 

<h4>Multiple Sequence Viewer</h4>

<li><p>Finding patterns can include PDB residue numbers with the syntax
<code>@</code><i>number</i>. This does not include insertion codes.
</p></li> 

<li><p>Finding patterns now uses an extended syntax in which restrictions can be
placed on particular residues, e.g. Ae means Ala in an extended region. As a
consequence each element (a sequence of characters that matches a single
residue) must be separated from others by a <code>-</code> character. The simple
syntax in which just the residue letters are entered is still accepted.</p>
<p>
Simple syntax: <code>ACE</code>
Extended syntax: <code>A-C-E</code>
</p></li>

<li><p>Repeat counts can be specified when finding patterns by placing the
number of repeats in parentheses, e.g. <code>A(3)</code> for 3 consecutive
alanines. A variable number is expressed as (m,n) with m&lt;n, e.g. A(2,4) means
from 2 to 4 alanines, and is matched in the sequence by AA, AAA, or AAAA. 
</p></li>

<li><p>You can create a similarity matrix from an alignment and use it in
subsequent alignments, in the <span class="GUI">Pairwise Alignment
Settings</span> dialog box. 
</p></li> 

<li><p>You can align sequences so that residues with identical residue numbers
(and insertion codes) are aligned.
</p></li> 

<li><p>You can renumber residues, either by simply specifying the base and
increment, or by copying the numbering from a template to which the sequence is
aligned. (Update 2)
</p></li> 

<li><p>An <span class="GUI">Analyze Binding Site</span> tool has been added
for calculating sequence identity in an alignment for residues within a range of
distances from a specified binding site. 
</p></li> 

<li><p>Building a homology model incorporates new features from Prime, including
choice of the model-building method and some new options.
</p></li>

<li><p>The default color scheme has been changed to Side-chain chemistry.
(Update 2)
</p></li> 

<li><p>You can undo and redo color scheme and annotation changes.
</p></li> 

<li><p>An annotation for antibody CDRs has been added.
</p></li> 

<li><p>You can add your own custom annotation to sequences, which you can edit in
Edit mode. You can also mark rectangular regions across sequences as an
annotation. (Update 2)
</p></li> 

<li><p>The <span class="GUI">New</span> item from the <span
class="GUI">File</span> menu is now on the <span class="GUI">Sequences</span>
menu as <span class="GUI">Clear All</span>. This item performs essentially the
same function. 
</p></li>

<p>The MSV project is stored by default inside the Maestro project.
</p> 

<li><p>The query management items have been moved from the <span
class="GUI">Sequences</span> menu to the <span class="GUI">File</span> menu.
</p></li>

<li><p>Fasta files with residue numbers can be imported. (Update 2)
</p></li> 


<h4>R-Group Analysis</h4>

<li><p>In the R-Group Analysis panel, you can now save the results of an
analysis and reload them later on for viewing.
</p></li> 

<li><p>You can export the table data in most panels as an image or as a CSV
file. The CSV file includes structures as SMILES strings, with the attachment
points marked with Xe and Kr as substitutes for the capping groups. 
</p></li>

<li><p>Cores are now included in activity and importance analysis. 
</p></li> 

<li><p>You can export the histogram in the <span class="GUI">Activity
Cliffs</span> panel as an image file. 
</p></li>

<li><p>Controls have been added for resizing the 2D structures in most panels. 
</p></li>

<h4>Scaffold Decomposition</h4>
<li><p>A new tool for analyzing structures into possible scaffolds has been
added, the <a href="../tools_menu/scaffold_decomposition.html"><span
class="GUI">Scaffold Decomposition</span> panel</a>.
</p></li>

<h4>Diagnostics</h4>
<li><p>A graphical tool (<span class="GUI">Diagnostics</span> panel) has been
added for running tests and reporting on licensing and host-related
conditions. The tool can be run from the command line as 
<code>$SCHRODINGER/diagnostics</code>, from the <span class="GUI">Help</span> 
menu in Maestro, or as an application on Windows or Mac. This tool should be
used to gather information to send to technical support.
</p></li>
