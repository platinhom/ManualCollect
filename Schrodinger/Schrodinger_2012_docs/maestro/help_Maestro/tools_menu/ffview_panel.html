<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The <span class="GUI">Force Field Viewer</span> panel facilitates detailed
examination of all the force-field interactions that are present in a given
MacroModel calculation. In order to use the Force Field Viewer, a MacroModel
energy operation must have been performed with a Complete listing (see the
<a href="../macromodel/energy_calculation.html">Energy Calculation</a> panel
topic).</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Force Field Viewer Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Force Field Viewer</span> panel:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Tools &rarr; 
Force Field Viewer</span>.</p></li>
</ul>

<a name="using"></a>
<h2>Using the Force Field Viewer Panel</h2>

<p>Data displayed by the Force Field Viewer is located in <code>.mmo</code>
files, which are created when energy operations are performed using
Complete energy listings. To read an <code>.mmo</code> file, click
<a href="#feature1">Open</a>. A file selector opens, in which the desired file
can be located.</p>

<p>At the top of the <span class="GUI">Force Field Viewer</span> panel, a number
of buttons appear that represent the various types of interactions that can be
present in a molecular mechanics calculation (stretch, bond angle etc.). After a
<code>.mmo</code> file has been read into the Force Field Viewer, any buttons
that correspond to types of interactions present in that particular file
become active. Each button, when selected, displays a corresponding panel. These
panels are described in detail elsewhere (see the list of <a
href="#ffv5">related topics</a> below).</p>

<dd><p>This button opens the <span class="GUI">Read .mmo File</span> panel that
allows you to navigate to the desired file.</p></dd>

<a name="feature2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">MMO File Name</span></dt>
<dd><p>This text box displays the name, path included, of the <span

the file you wish to work with, you may open it directly by entering the
filename in this text box.</p></dd>

<a name="feature3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Stretch</span></dt>
<dd><p>This button opens the <span class="GUI">Stretch</span> panel, which is
used to display all the stretching interactions for a given calculation. When
this panel is opened, the first entry in the Stretch Interactions List is
selected. The location in the displayed structure that corresponds
to the selected entry is marked with a dashed yellow line and magnifying glass
icon.</p></dd>

<a name="feature4"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Bond Angle</span></dt>
<dd><p>This button opens the <span class="GUI">Bend</span> panel, which is
used to display all the bending interactions for a given calculation. When this
panel is opened, the first entry in the Bend Interactions List is
selected. The location in the displayed structure
corresponding to the selected entry is marked with a dashed red line
and magnifying glass icon.</p></dd>

<a name="feature5"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Torsion Angle</span></dt>
<dd><p>This button opens the <span class="GUI">Torsion Angle</span> panel, which
displays all the torsion
interactions for a calculation. When this panel is opened, the first entry
in the Torsion Interactions List is selected. The location
in the displayed structure corresponding to the selected entry is
marked with a pale green dashed line and magnifying glass icon.</p></dd>

<a name="feature6"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Improper Torsion</span></dt>
<dd><p>This button opens the <span class="GUI">Improper Torsion</span> panel,
which displays the improper torsion interactions associated with a particular
calculation. can be viewed. When this panel is opened, the first entry in the
Improper Torsion Interactions List is selected. The corresponding location
in the displayed structure is marked with a gold-colored asterisk and
magnifying glass icon. </p>
<p>Note that the <span class="GUI">Wilson Angle</span>
button and the <span class="GUI">Improper Torsion</span> buttons are not
active simultaneously, since they perform similar operations, but are associated
with different force fields. Wilson angles are used in MMFF and MMFFs force
field calculations, and improper torsions are used in the others.</p></dd>

<a name="feature7"></a>
<dt>Wilson Angle</dt>
<dd><p>This button opens the <span class="GUI">Wilson Angle</span> panel, which
displays all Wilson angle interactions present in the current <code>.mmo</code>
file. By default, the first entry in the Wilson Angle
Interactions List is selected, and the corresponding location in
the displayed structure is marked with a peach-colored asterisk and
magnifying glass icon.</p>
<p>Note that the <span class="GUI">Wilson Angle</span>
button and the <span class="GUI">Improper Torsion</span> buttons are not
active simultaneously, since they perform similar operations, but are associated
with different force fields. Wilson angles are used in MMFF and MMFFs force
field calculations, and improper torsions are used in the others.</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">GB Solvation</span></dt>
<dd><p>This button opens the <span class="GUI">GB Solvation</span> panel,
which can be used to view the Generalized Born (GB) portion of the solvation
interactions for a given calculation. The first entry in the GB
Interactions List on the GB Solvation panel is selected by default when the
panel is first opened, and the corresponding atom in
the displayed structure is marked with a yellow asterisk and
magnifying glass icon.</p></dd>
