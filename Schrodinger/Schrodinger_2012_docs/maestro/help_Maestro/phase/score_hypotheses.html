<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
In the <span class="GUI">Score Hypotheses</span> step, you score the
hypotheses for the variants you selected in the previous step, examine the
hypotheses, add excluded volumes to hypotheses if desired, and select a
hypothesis with which to build a QSAR model, if desired. When you have completed
this step, you can proceed to building a QSAR model or to searching for matches
to hypotheses. </p>

<h3>Scoring Hypotheses</h3>

<p>Each hypothesis contains a set of pharmacophores that are derived from conformations
of a set of active ligands. The first stage of the scoring process is to find the optimum
alignment of the pharmacophores, and eliminate hypotheses that do not have good
alignments. The initial score is based on the RMS deviation of the site point positions
and the average cosine of the angles formed by corresponding pairs of vector features
(acceptors, donors, and aromatic rings). To the alignment contributions are added
a score for the volume overlap of the aligned ligands, a selectivity score, a
contribution for the number of matches, a contribution for the relative energy
of the reference ligand and a contribution for the reference ligand
activity. The &quot;survival score&quot; is a combination of these scores with
user-adjustable weights. The scoring is performed on the ligands in the active
set, which are the ligands used to develop the hypotheses, for all variants
selected in the <span class="GUI">Variants</span> table of the
<span class="GUI">Find Common Pharmacophores</span> step.</p>

<p>When you click <span class="GUI">Score Actives</span> to score the
hypotheses, the <a href="score_actives.html"><span class="GUI">Score
Actives</span> dialog box</a> opens. In this dialog box, you can examine and
adjust the weights of the terms in the survival score, the alignment thresholds,
and the filters on the number of hypotheses to keep. After you have made any
changes, click <span class="GUI">Start</span>.  A dialog box is
displayed, in which you can select the host, the number of CPUs to use, and the user
name on the host.</p>

<p>When the job finishes, the surviving hypotheses and their scores are displayed in the
<span class="GUI">Hypotheses</span> table.

<p>If you have assigned ligands to an inactive set, you can score the hypotheses
for matches to the inactive ligands, and subtract a fraction of the survival
score for the inactives from the survival score for the actives. Hypotheses that
match inactives as well as actives are then scored lower than hypotheses that
match actives but not inactives. The scoring function for the inactives is the
same as for actives.</p>

<p>To calculate this score, click <span class="GUI">Score Inactives</span>. The
<a href="score_inactives.html"><span class="GUI">Score Inactives</span> dialog
box</a> opens, in which you can specify the weight of the survival score of the
inactives to subtract from the survival score of the actives. After you have
made any changes, click <span class="GUI">Start</span>.  A dialog box is
displayed, in which you can select the host, the number of CPUs to use, and the
user name on the host.  When the job is finished, the results are displayed in
the <span class="GUI">Survival - inactive</span> column of the <span
class="GUI">Hypotheses</span> table.
</p>

<p>If you want to adjust the weights in the scoring function and compute a new score,
you can do so by clicking <span class="GUI">Rescore</span>. In
<span class="GUI">Rescore Hypotheses</span> dialog box, you can set
the weights of the terms in the scoring function and the inactive score weight.
After you have made any changes, click <span class="GUI">Start</span>, make
any job settings, and click <span class="GUI">Start</span> again. The
results of the rescoring are listed in the <span class="GUI">Post-hoc</span>
column of the <span class="GUI">Hypotheses</span> table.</p>


<a name="ScoreHyp2.2"></a>
<h3>Examining Hypotheses and Ligand Alignments</h3>

<p>Once you have generated scores for the hypotheses, you can examine the listed
hypotheses, one at a time. To examine a hypothesis, select it in the <span
class="GUI">Hypotheses</span> table. The hypothesis is displayed in the
Workspace, and data for the aligned ligands is displayed in the <span
class="GUI">Alignments</span> table: activities, pharm set membership, fitness
score (which is the default survival score without the contribution from the
number of matches), the number of sites matched, and the energy of the matching
conformer relative to the lowest-energy conformer.</p>

<p>You can view the aligned ligands and information on their alignments in the
Workspace by clicking the diamond in the <span class="GUI">In</span> column of
the <span class="GUI">Alignments</span> table. This column is multiple-select:
you can add ligands to the display with shift-click and control-click. You can
display and undisplay the hypothesis by clicking the <span class="GUI">View
Hypothesis</span> toolbar button. From the toolbar (or the <span
class="GUI">Display</span> menu) you can also display the distances between the
site points and the angles between all sets of three site points. </p>

<p>By default, only the ligands that match the hypothesis are aligned to the
hypothesis. Although the <span class="GUI">Alignments</span> table lists
all ligands, the rows for the remaining ligands are colored dark gray, and do
not display any data. </p>

<p>It can be useful to display the alignments and data for the remaining
&quot;non-model&quot; ligands: those not in the active set or those that do not
match all site points. You might want to examine a hypothesis more closely if it
matches inactive ligands, for example, to determine the reason the inactive
ligands match, and decide whether to keep or to remove the hypothesis.</p>

<p>To display data for these ligands, click <span class="GUI">Alignment
Options</span> below the <span class="GUI">Alignments</span> table, and
select <span class="GUI">Align non-model ligands</span> in the <span
class="GUI">Alignment Options</span> dialog box. The table is updated
with information for the entire ligand set used in the model development.</p>

<p>If in your examination of a hypothesis, you decide that the hypothesis is not
a good one, you can delete it by clicking <span class="GUI">Delete</span>. If
you have found a hypothesis that you want to use with several databases, you can
export the hypothesis to a file by clicking <span class="GUI">Export</span> and
providing the file name. You can later import this hypothesis into a project
that contains a database you want to search. </p>

<a name="ScoreHyp2.3"></a>
<h3>Adding Excluded Volumes to Hypotheses</h3>

<p>Excluded volumes are regions of space in which there should be no atoms from
any active ligand. If you have included inactive ligands in the ligand set, you
can use these ligands to define excluded volumes. This might be important if,
for example, the inactive ligands otherwise match the hypothesis.  The excluded
volumes are then used when you use the hypothesis to search for matches.
</p>

<p>To define one or more excluded volumes using the inactive ligands as a guide,
first ensure that all ligands have been aligned, then display one or more of the
active ligands along with one or more of the inactive ligands. Regions of space
in which inactive ligands have atoms but active ligands do not are likely
candidates for excluded volumes. </p>

<p>With the ligands displayed, click <span class="GUI">Excluded Volumes</span>.
The <a href="excluded_volumes_db.html"><span class="GUI">Excluded Volumes</span>
dialog box</a> is displayed. To define a volume, pick a set of atoms in the
Workspace that belong to the inactive ligand. A temporary sphere that defines
the excluded volume is placed at the centroid of the atoms. When you have picked
an appropriate set of atoms, click <span class="GUI">Add Volume</span> to add
the sphere to the hypothesis as an excluded volume. You can subsequently change
the radius of the sphere and its location by editing the table in the dialog
box. </p>

<a name="ScoreHyp2.4"></a>
<h3>Clustering Hypotheses</h3>

<p>When there are several hypotheses of a given variant that look very much
alike and have very similar scores, it is useful to cluster these hypotheses,
and show only a single representative from each cluster.
</p>

<p>To cluster the hypotheses, click <span class="GUI">Cluster</span>, select a
linkage method (<span class="GUI">Complete</span> is usually fine), and click
<span class="GUI">Start</span>. When the job finishes, you can display the
cluster representatives by clicking <span class="GUI">View Clusters</span> and
choosing a representative type in the <span class="GUI">View Clusters</span>
dialog box. You can also change the similarity level that defines the clusters. 
</p>

</p>

<a name="ScoreHyp2.5"></a>
<h3>Continuing from This Step</h3>

<p>After scoring the hypotheses, you can continue directly to a search for
matches, or continue to the next step and build a QSAR model. </p>

<p>To search for matches, select the hypotheses in the <span
class="GUI">Hypotheses</span> table that you want to use in the
search, and click <span class="GUI">Search for Matches</span>. The
<span class="GUI">Advanced Pharmacophore Screening</span> panel opens, with
the selected hypotheses listed in the <span class="GUI">Available
Hypotheses</span> table, and the first of these hypotheses selected.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> To make hypotheses available in the
<a href="find_matches.html"><span class="GUI">Advanced Pharmacophore Screening</span>
panel</a>, you must either export them, or select them and click 
<span class="GUI">Search for Matches</span>.</p>

<p>To proceed to the next step<a href="build_qsar_model.html">
<span class="GUI">Build QSAR Model</span></a>, select the hypotheses you
want to use to build QSAR models, then click <span class="GUI">Next</span>.
Building a QSAR model is not necessary for searching for matches, so you can
also finish at this step.</p>
