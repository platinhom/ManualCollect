<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
This dialog box allows you to set up a job to align several hypotheses to a
reference (&quot;stationary&quot;) hypothesis. You must select the hypotheses
first, either in the Project Table or in the <span class="GUI">Manage
Pharmacophore Hypotheses</span> panel.
</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Align Hypotheses Dialog Box</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Align Hypotheses</span> dialog box from the
<span class="GUI">Manage Pharmacophore Hypotheses</span> panel:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Right-click and hold on the hypothesis you want to use for the fixed
hypothesis, and choose <span class="GUI">Align Hypotheses</span> from the
<span class="GUI">shortcut </span> menu.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Align Hypotheses</span> dialog box from the
<span class="GUI">Project Table</span> panel:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Right-click and hold on the <i>H</i> button for the hypothesis you want to
use for the fixed hypothesis, and choose <span class="GUI">Align
Hypotheses</span> from the <span class="GUI">shortcut </span> menu.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Note:</b> You must choose all the hypotheses before opening the dialog
box. You cannot add hypotheses afterward.</p>

<a name="using"></a>
<h2>Using the Align Hypotheses Dialog Box</h2>

<p>In this dialog box, you can align a set of hypotheses, called &quot;free&quot;
hypotheses, to a chosen hypothesis, called the &quot;fixed&quot;
hypothesis. Hypotheses are aligned by matching the site points. You can choose
how many site points must match, what the distance matching tolerance should be,
and how to choose the best alignment.</p>

<p>To control which site points in a given free hypothesis match the site points
in the fixed hypothesis, you can define equivalences between the site points. In
each hypothesis, the sites are assigned to an equivalence class, which is
identified by an alphanumeric character. Sites that belong to a given class in
the free hypothesis are matched to sites of the same class in the fixed
hypothesis.  By default, the classes correspond to the feature types: all
acceptors are in the same class, all donors are in the same class, and so on.
The default characters used for the feature types are the numbers 1 to 9.
</p>

<p>If you want to ensure that a particular site in a free hypothesis matches a
particular site in the fixed hypothesis, you can assign these two sites to a
unique equivalence class by giving them the same equivalence character. For
example, if the site list for the fixed hypothesis is AHNRRR and for the free
hypothesis is AAHNRR, and you want R6 in the free hypothesis to match R4 in the
fixed hypothesis, you could change the default equivalence strings from 134666
and 113466 to 134r66 and 11346r.</p>

<p>If you want to reset equivalencies to their default values, select the rows
that you want to change, then right-click in the table and choose <span
class="GUI">Reset Equivalencies</span> from the shortcut menu. If you want to
move one of the free hypotheses so that it is next to the fixed hypothesis,
select the hypothesis, then right-click and choose <span class="GUI">Move to
Top</span> from the shortcut menu. This makes it easier to compare the site list
and the equivalence string. </p>

<p>To see which sites to align, you can display them in the Workspace by
clicking the <span class="GUI">In</span> column in the <span
class="GUI">Hypotheses to be aligned</span> table. You can distinguish the
hypotheses by coloring them&mdash;select the table rows for the hypotheses,
right-click in the table and choose <span class="GUI">Entry</span> from the
<span class="GUI">Color by</span> submenu. The sites in the hypotheses are
labeled with the feature type, site index, and equivalence class (in
parentheses).</p>

<p>You can change the fixed hypothesis by right-clicking on the desired
hypothesis and choosing <span class="GUI">Make Stationary</span> from the
shortcut menu. You can also move table rows so that they are immediately below
the fixed hypothesis by selecting them, then right-clicking and choosing <span
class="GUI">Move to Top</span> from the shortcut menu.</p>

<p>The alignment is performed when you click <span class="GUI">OK</span> or
<span class="GUI">Apply</span>. Phase then attempts to align all the free
hypotheses to the fixed hypothesis. If you want to remove any of the hypotheses
from the alignment, select them, then right-click and choose <span
class="GUI">Remove from Table</span> from the shortcut menu.</p>

<p>If there are any errors in the alignment, the dialog box remains open so that
you can take action on the failure.</p>

<h3>Hypotheses to be aligned table</h3>

<p>This table lists the hypotheses to be aligned. The stationary or
reference hypothesis row is colored blue and is at the top of the table.
You can select multiple rows in the table, and apply an action to them from the
shortcut menu. The table columns are described below:
</p>

<table cellpadding=5>
<tr>
<td><span class="GUI">In</span></td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>Inclusion status of the hypothesis and its reference ligand. The
diamond has a cross in it if the ligand is included in the Workspace, and is
empty if the ligand is excluded. You can include and exclude ligands and their
hypotheses with click, shift-click and control-click.  The hypothesis features are
displayed as described in the <a href="create_sites.html#feature6">Create
Sites topic</a>, and are labeled by the feature letter and index, with the
equivalence character in parentheses.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span class="GUI">Title</span></td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>The title of the project entry for the hypothesis.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span class="GUI">Sites</span></td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>List of sites in the hypothesis (this is the variant label).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span class="GUI">Equivalences</span></td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>String that sets the equivalence of sites between hypotheses. There is a
one-to-one correspondence between the characters in the equivalence string and
the characters in the sites list. The equivalence character identifies the
class that the site belongs to. By default, all sites of the same feature type
belong to the same class. When alignment is performed, features in a given class
in the free hypothesis are matched only to features in the same class in the
fixed hypothesis. This column is editable. The characters used for the
equivalence classes can be arbitrarily chosen from the alphanumeric character
set (A&ndash;Z, a&ndash;z, 0&ndash;9).
</tr>
</table>

<p>The shortcut menu (right-click) contains the following items:</p>

<dl>
<dt>Make Stationary</dt>
<dd><p>Make the hypothesis whose row you right-clicked the fixed (stationary)
hypothesis. The row is moved to the top of the table and colored blue.
</p></dd>
<dt>Move to Top</dt>
<dd><p>Move the selected rows to the top of the table, immediately below the
fixed hypothesis row.
</p></dd>
<dt>Reset Equivalencies</dt>
<dd><p>Reset the equivalency strings for the selected rows to their
defaults. The default is to assign each feature type to an equivalency class,
with a numeric label from 1-9.
</p></dd>
<dt>Remove from Table</dt>
<dd><p>Remove the selected rows from the table. The hypotheses for these rows
will not be aligned. You cannot add the rows back once they have been removed,
without exiting the dialog box and selecting the hypotheses in the parent panel.
</p></dd>
<dt>Color by</dt>
<dd><p>Color the selected hypotheses by the scheme selected from the
submenu. The submenu has the same choices as in the 
<span class="GUI">Manage Pharmacophore Hypotheses</span> panel: 
<span class="GUI">Atom and Site Type</span>, and <span
class="GUI">Entry</span>
(see the <a href="manage_pharmacophore_hypotheses.html#feature4">shortcut menu section</a> in
the Manage Pharmacophore Hypotheses panel topic).
</p></dd>
</dl>

<a name="feature2"></a>
<h3>Must match at least <i>N</i> equivalent sites text box</h3>

<p>Enter the minimum number of sites in each free hypothesis that must match
sites in the fixed hypothesis. You must have at least three sites for an
alignment to be performed.
</p>

<a name="feature3"></a>
<h3>Distance matching tolerance text box</h3>
<p>Enter the tolerance for matching the distances between equivalent sites. Two
sites are considered equivalent if the distance between them is less than this
tolerance.
</p>

<a name="feature4"></a>
<h3>Choose best alignment by options</h3>
<p>Select the criterion for evaluating the best alignment. The possible
alignments can be ranked by the RMSD between the free and the fixed hypothesis,
or by the number of sites matched first, then the RMSD. </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Number of sites matched, then RMSD</span> if it is
more important to obtain a match on as many sites as possible than to obtain the
smallest RMSD. The best alignment is the alignment with the most matching sites
and the smallest RMSD for the number of matching sites.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">RMSD only</span> if you want the best match
regardless of the number of sites&mdash;but note that this option favors matches
with fewer sites, because the RMSD is usually smaller.
</p></li>
