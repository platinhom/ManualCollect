<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
In the <span class="GUI">Prepare Ligands</span> step, you add the ligands
to the Phase run that you want to use as the basis of the pharmacophore model
and the QSAR model, including any activity data, and define the set of ligands
to be used for the pharmacophore model (the &quot;active set&quot;). You then
clean up the structures and generate conformers, if needed.
</p>

<a name="working"></a>
<h2>Working in the Prepare Ligands Step</h2>

<p>The first task in the <span class="GUI">Prepare Ligands</span> step is
to add a set of ligands to the Phase run. You can obtain the ligands from the
Project Table, from another run, or from a file. To add ligands, click the
appropriate <span class="GUI">Add Ligands</span> button. When you add
ligands, you can choose an activity property if one exists in the source of
the ligands. The property values are added to the run.
If the property does not exist, you can add the property values by editing the
<span class="GUI">Activity</span> column of the
<span class="GUI">Ligands</span> table. </p>

<p>Each &quot;ligand&quot; in Phase is actually a set of conformations of a
ligand structure. When you add ligands, they are automatically placed into
conformer sets. If you add ligands from a previous run, the sets are preserved
with all their associated data.</p>

<p>Stereoisomers can be considered as &quot;the same ligand&quot; or
&quot;different ligands&quot;. You can group stereoisomers into different sets
or into the same set by selecting the ligands in the table and choosing <span
class="GUI">Separate Stereoisomers</span> or <span class="GUI">Merge
Stereoisomers</span> from the table shortcut menu. By default, stereoisomers are
not treated as separate ligands.<p>

<p>You can also partition the conformers into different sets by title. This is
useful if the stereochemical information is not recognized, as is the case for
some ring systems. You can create a title that reflects the stereochemistry, and
use <span class="GUI">Split conformers by title</span> when importing the
conformers, or separate them afterwards from the shortcut menu with <span
class="GUI">Separate conformers by title</span>. To merge them again, choose
<span class="GUI">Merge conformers, ignoring title</span> from the shortcut menu.
</p>

<p>Other structural variations that are not important to pharmacore model
development can also be accounted for; see below for details.
</p>

<p>The second task in the <span class="GUI">Prepare Ligands</span> step is
to prepare the ligand structures for model development. The structures must be
3D all-atom structures that are a good representation of the experimental
structures, and a set of conformers should be provided or generated for each
ligand. To ensure that the structures are in the appropriate form, click
<a href="clean_structures.html"><span class="GUI">Clean Structures</span></a>.
After cleaning the structures, click <a href="generate_conformers.html"><span
class="GUI">Generate Conformers</span></a> to set up a conformational search job
for the ligands.</p>

<p>The third task in the <span class="GUI">Prepare Ligands</span> step is
to classify the ligands as active, inactive, or neither. The active set is used
directly to develop the pharmacophore model. The inactive set can be used in
scoring to screen out hypotheses that match both actives and inactives.
It is not necessary to assign every active molecule to the active set: if you
have groups of highly similar ligands with nearly the same level of activity,
for example, you may want to select only one or two ligands from each group. The
other ligands can be used later on for defining excluded volumes or for QSAR
model testing and development. </p>

<p>The fourth (and optional) task is to make some decisions about how the
actives are to be treated. 
</p>

<p>If you have active ligands that do not have the same connectivity (such as
tautomers or ionization states), you can assign them to the same ligand group,
so that they will be treated as &quot;the same ligand&quot; for the purpose of
finding common pharmacophores. To do this, select the ligands that you want to
group and choose <span class="GUI">Group Actives</span> from the table shortcut
menu. The group number is listed in the <span class="GUI">Active Group</span>
column of the <span class="GUI">Ligands</span> table. When matching is done to
find common pharmacophores, only one of the ligands in the group needs to
match. To ungroup ligands, select all the ligands in the group and choose 
<span class="GUI">Ungroup Actives</span> from the table shortcut menu.</p>

<p>If you plan to match less than the full number of actives when searching for
common pharmacophores, you can choose actives to which a match is required, by 
selecting the check box in the <span class="GUI">Required Match</span> column
for that active. Actives within a group must all have the same matching
requirement: if one is checked, all of them are checked. This means that a match
must be found in the group, not that all members of the group must match. 
</p>

<h2>Prepare Ligands Step Features</h2>

<p>The controls and features of the <span class="GUI">Prepare Ligands</span> step
are described here.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#feature1"><span class="GUI">Add Ligands</span> controls</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature2"><span class="GUI">Edit selected ligands</span> controls</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature3"><span class="GUI">Ligands</span> table</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature4"><span class="GUI">Activity Thresholds</span> button</a></li>
</ul>

<a name="feature1"></a>
<h3>Add Ligands Controls</h3>

<p>You can add ligands from a file, from a previous run, or from a Maestro
project. When you add ligands, they are grouped into conformer sets.
Stereoisomers, if they exist, are separated into different conformer sets.
Existing sets from a previous run are preserved with all their associated 
data. 
</p>

<p>Phase requires all-atom, 3D structures, without counter ions and solvent
molecules. If the ligands are not in this form, you can convert them with the
<a href="#feature2.1"><span class="GUI">Clean Structures</span></a> facility. </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#feature1.1"><span class="GUI">From File</span> button</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature1.2"><span class="GUI">From Run</span> button</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature1.3"><span class="GUI">From Project</span> button</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature1.4"><span class="GUI">Split conformers by title</span>
option</a></li>
</ul>

<dl>

<a name="feature1.1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">From File</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Opens a file selector in which you can navigate to and select files. You
can choose multiple files for import. Only Maestro format is supported, but you
can use the custom filter to narrow the list of files if desired.
Maestro Properties are read with the structures. When you click
<span class="GUI">Open</span>, the <span class="GUI">Choose Activity
Property</span> dialog box opens. This dialog box contains a list of properties,
from which you can choose a single property for the activity of the ligands.
You can also convert the units of the activity to logarithmic units in this
dialog box. Phase requires activities to be expressed as 
-log<sub>10</sub>(concentration).
</p></dd>

<a name="feature1.2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">From Run</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Opens the <span class="GUI">Add From Run</span> dialog box. This button
is only active if there are other runs in the project that contain conformer
sets. The dialog box contains a list of all conformer sets, from which you can
choose multiple sets. Sets can be duplicated in the list; if you select
duplicate sets, only one is added. The activity values and the membership of the
active set are extracted from the run. In the case of duplicates, the activity
data from the first run chosen is used.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature1.3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">From Project</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Opens the <a href="add_from_project_db.html"><span class="GUI">Add From
Project</span> dialog box</a>. This dialog box contains two lists: a list of
entries, and a list of properties.  You can choose multiple entries to be added,
and you can choose a single property for the activity of the ligands.  The
ligands are copied into the run, so that any changes made by Phase have no
effect on the original ligands in the Project Table.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature1.4"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Split conformers by title</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>Use the ligand title to assign structures that are conformers to
different ligand conformer sets. This feature can be used to separate structures
that have some stereochemical difference that is not detected by Phase, such as
cis and trans disubstituted cyclohexyl rings. You can also do this from the
shortcut menu in the <span class="GUI">Ligands</span> table for the selected
ligand conformer sets. </p>
<p><b>Warning:</b> If you use this option, you should ensure that you import all
the conformers you need for the model. Generating conformers for such structures
can produce conformers that should be in a different ligand conformer set from
the parent, which will invalidate the separation. For example, suppose you have
two conformers, A and B that have different stereochemical properties, and you
separate them by title. If you generate conformers for A, there is a chance that
you will generate one whose stereochemical properties are the same as for B, but
this conformer will be labeled with the title for A, and cannot subsequently be
separated by title.
</p></dd>

</dl>

<a name="feature2"></a>
<h3>Edit Selected Ligands Buttons</h3>

<p>Once you have added ligands to the run, you can modify them in various ways.
If the ligand structures are 2D, lack hydrogen atoms, or include counter ions or
solvent molecules, you must clean them up before proceeding. If the structures
do not have the desired chirality or ionization (protonation) state, or if you
want structures with different chirality, you can use the
<span class="GUI">Clean Structures</span> facility to generate them. If you
do not have the desired set of conformers, you can generate them. You can also
set an activity cutoff for determining which ligands are in the active set.

<ul>
<li><a href="#feature2.1"><span class="GUI">Clean Structures</span>
button</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature2.2"><span class="GUI">Generate Conformers</span>
button</a></li>
</ul>

<dl>

<a name="feature2.1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Clean Structures</span> button
<dd><p>Opens the <a href="clean_structures.html"><span class="GUI">Clean
Structures</span> dialog box</a>. From this
dialog box, you can run a job to clean up the structures, or generate structures
with the desired chiralities and ionization states. In this process, the
following steps are performed as necessary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Convert structures from 2D to 3D</li>
<li>Add hydrogen atoms to ensure that the structure is an all-atom structure</li>
<li>Remove counter ions and water molecules</li>
<li>Add or remove protons to produce the most probable ionization state at the
target pH (optional)</li>
<li>Generate stereoisomers (optional)</li>
<li>Remove "bad" structures</li>
<li>Perform an energy minimization</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, you can control whether to neutralize charged groups or generate
an ionization state by adding or removing hydrogen ions, and whether to generate
structures with different chiralities.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature2.2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Generate Conformers</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Opens the <a href="generate_conformers.html"><span class="GUI">Generate
Conformers</span> dialog box</a>. From
this dialog box, you can run a job that generates conformers of the ligand. The
dialog box has options for the search mode and solvation treatment, and allows
you to limit the number of conformations generated, either to a specific number
or by energy.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature3"></a>
<h3>Ligands Table</h3>

<p>The table of ligands lists all the ligands that have been added, grouped into
conformer sets. You can select table rows in the usual fashion with click,
shift-click and control-click. You can sort the columns by clicking the column
header, and you can resize the columns by dragging  the column boundary.</p>

<p>Right-clicking in the table displays a shortcut menu, from which you can
select an action to perform on the table rows.</p>

<dl>
<dt><span class="GUI">Export Table Data</span></dt>
<dd><p>Export the data in the table to a CSV or an HTML file. 
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Group Ligands</span></dt>

<dt><span class="GUI">Group Ligands by Title</span></dt>
<dd><p>Assign the selected ligands to the same group if they have the same title.
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Ungroup Ligands</span></dt>
<dd><p>Remove the selected ligands from the groups, and remove the group if it
is empty. 
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Merge Stereoisomers</span></dt>
<dd><p>Merge conformer sets for stereoisomers for the selected table rows. If
the rows you select include conformer sets that were separated by title, they
will be merged if they contain recognized stereochemical information; if they do
not, they will not be merged. 
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Separate Stereoisomers</span></dt>
<dd><p>Separate conformer sets into sets for each stereoismer for the selected
table rows.
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Merge Conformers, Ignoring Title</span></dt>
<dd><p>Merge conformer sets for the selected table rows, ignoring the title as a
basis for defining conformer sets. You should use this option to undo the
separation of conformers by title. If you select sets that were separated by
stereochemistry, they will be merged.
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Separate Conformers by Title</span></dt>
<dd><p>Separate conformer sets into sets based on the title of the structures
for the selected table rows.
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Add Conformers to Project Table</span></dt>
<dd><p>Add the selected conformer sets to the Project Table. Each set is added
as an entry group, named with the ligand name.
</p></dd>
<dt><span class="GUI">Export Conformers to File</span></dt>
<dd><p>Export the selected conformer sets to a Maestro file. Opens a file
chooser, in which you can browse to the desired location and name the file.

<dd><p>Invert the row selection: the selected rows are deselected and the
unselected rows are selected.
</p></dd>
<dt>Delete</dt>
<dd><p>Delete the selected ligands. There is no confirmation for this action, so
ensure that you have the desired selection. 
</p></dd>

</dl>

<p>The table columns are described below.</p>

<dl>

<dt><span class="GUI">In</span></dt>
<dd><p>Inclusion status in the Workspace of the ligand. The diamond has a cross in
it if the ligand is included in the Workspace, and is empty if the ligand is
excluded.  The molecule that is displayed is the first conformer of the set. If
you want to view other conformers, you must export them to the Project Table
(right-click menu). This column functions like the <span class="GUI">In</span> column of the Project Table: click in the
diamond to include a ligand and exclude all others, control-click to include or
exclude a ligand without affecting the inclusion of the others, and shift-click
to include a range of ligands. The included ligands are added as a scratch entry
to the Workspace. Inclusion and exclusion of ligands has no effect on the
inclusion state of entries in the Project Table.</p>
<p>
You can also display feedback information in the Workspace when you include a
single ligand. This information can include data from the table. The setting and
choice of properties is made in the 
<a href="phase_workspace_feedback.html"><span class="GUI">Phase Workspace
Feedback</span> dialog box</a>, which you open by
choosing <span class="GUI">Display &rarr; Workspace Feedback</span>.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Name</span></dt>
<dd><p>The name of the ligand. The default name is taken from the Title property
of the ligand, if you added it from a project or from a file in which the title is
defined. Otherwise a name is created for the ligand. You can edit the name by
clicking in the cell, changing the text, then pressing <span class="GUI">ENTER</span>.
The name does not have to be unique.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Activity</span></dt>
<dd><p>Contains the value of the activity you selected when you added the ligands.
If you did not select an activity, the table cells are empty. You can edit
the activity by clicking in the cell, changing the text, then pressing
<span class="GUI">ENTER</span>.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Pharm Set</span></dt>

<dd><p>Indicates which set a ligand belongs to: the active ligands that will be
used to develop the pharmacophore model (the &quot;active set&quot;), the
inactive ligands that can be used for scoring and elimination of nonselective
hypotheses (the &quot;inactive set&quot;), or neither set. You can change the
set membership by clicking the column. The text in the column cycles between
<span class="GUI">active</span>, <span class="GUI">inactive</span>, and blank (for neither set). You can
change the set membership for the selected ligands by control-clicking the
column for any one of the ligands.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Active Group</span></dt>
<dd><p>The index of the group to which the active ligand is assigned. Groups are
indexed starting from 1. Initially, all actives are assigned to different groups.
Searching for common pharmacophores is done on the basis of these groups: only
one ligand in a group needs to be matched.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Required Match</span></dt>
<dd><p>Checkboxes to enforce matching to a particular ligand when searching for
common pharmacophores. This feature is only relevant when matching to less than
the total number of actives. 
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI"># Conformations</span></dt>
<dd><p>The number of conformations stored for the ligand. You will normally want to
generate multiple conformers for each ligand, unless, for example, you are
developing a pharmacophore model from x-ray structures.
</p></dd>

</dl>

<a name="feature4"></a>
<h3>Activity Thresholds Button</h3>

<p>The <span class="GUI">Activity Thresholds</span> button opens the
<span class="GUI">Activity Thresholds</span> dialog box, in
which you can set a cutoff value for the active and the inactive ligands.
Ligands with activity greater than the active threshold are included in the
active set; ligands with activity less than the inactive threshold are included
in the inactive set; ligands with activity between the thresholds are included
in neither set (no set membership).
