<p>Maestro commands are one-line commands. They consist of a keyword and
zero or more options and zero or more operands. Options are of the form
name=value, while operands are names. The syntax of a Maestro command is: </p>
<pre>
<i>keyword</i> [<i>options</i>] [<i>operands</i>]
</pre>

<p>The keyword is always first on the command line and it must match a known
keyword completely (i.e. to all characters).
There is an alias facility that allows you to map keywords to
shorter names. These substitutions are made before the command is processed.
See the topic <a href="../maestro_menu/alias_panel.html">Command Alias Panel</a>
for details. 
</p>

<p>The options can consist of any number of <i>name</i>=<i>value</i> pairs.
Options can be of type Boolean
(yes/no;y/n;t/f;true/false are valid values), string, integer or real.
Some integer options may have &quot;lookup&quot; tables. For example in the
<code>adjustdistance</code> command below, the <code>move</code> option can have
three values, which are stored internally as integers. </p>

<p>Options are used to set values that generally correspond to states within
the program. Once an option is set its value persists for all subsequent
commands until it is specified again. Commands that only contain a keyword
and options will only set the states corresponding to those option values
and not perform any other action. For example the command:
<pre>
adjustdistance distance=2.0
</pre>
does not change any distances, but just sets the value of the distance.
A subsequent command
<pre>
adjustdistance 5 7
</pre>
adjusts the distance between atoms 5 and 7 to the value specified previously.
</p>

<p>The operands are simply anything left over once the
keyword and options are removed. The nature of the operands depends on
specific commands. It could be a file name, a list of atom numbers,
or a string in Maestro Atom Specification Language (ASL) that is
used to describe arbitrary sets of atoms based on certain properties.
</p>

<p>Some examples of commands are given in the following table.</p>

<table border cols=2 width="100%">

<tr>
<td><b>Command</b></td>

<td><b>Action/Description</b></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><code>fit</code></td>

<td>The 'fit' command has no options and no operands. It fits all displayed structures
to the 3D window.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><code>displaypose </code><i>pose-name</i>


<td>The <code>displaypose</code> command has one operand--a name. The command
displays the pose a hold box named pose in the Workspace.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><code>adjustdistance distance=<i>x</i> move={attached|terminal|single}
<i>atom1</i> <i>atom2</i></code></td>


<td>The <code>adjustdistance</code> command has two options,
<code>distance</code> and <code>move</code>, and two operands, <i>atom1</i>
and <i>atom2</i>. The command moves <i>atom2</i> so that the distance between it
and <i>atom1</i> is the value given by <i>x</i>
specified atoms, sets the force constant to the value specified in
<i>force_constant_value</i>, and sets the width to the value of <i>halfwidth</i>. </td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>All graphical actions in the GUI cause one or more commands to be recorded by
the Maestro GUI. The commands can be saved and played back at a later time or
during a later session.  See the <a href="../window_menu/cse_panel.html">Command
Script Editor Panel</a> topic for more information. </p>
