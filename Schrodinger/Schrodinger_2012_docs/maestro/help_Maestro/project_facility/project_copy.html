<p>There are a few ways of making a copy of a project, depending on how you want
to continue working:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a copy and continue working in the original.</li>
<li>Create a copy and continue working in the copy.</li>
<li>Create a zipped backup copy.</li>
</ul>

<p>To copy a project and continue working in the copy, choose
<span class="GUI">Project &rarr; Save As</span>
in the main window. A copy is made of the the project, and the copy becomes the
current project. This allow you to preserve the original project under its
original name, and create a new project to work in.
</p>
<p>To copy a project and continue working in the original project, choose 
<span class="GUI">Project &rarr; Export Project</span>
in the main window. A copy is made of the the project, but the current project
remains the same. This allows you to preserve the state of the project under a
new name, and continue to work in the original project. This choice has some
flexibility in what is exported from the project.</p>

<p>In both cases, a project selector opens, in which you can specify the
location and name of the project copy, and click <span
class="GUI">Save</span>. Maestro adds a <tt>.prj</tt> extension to the project
name if you did not supply one.</p>

<p>You can also copy a project from the command line with the UNIX <tt>cp
-r</tt> command, or use your file explorer to copy the project. A project is
simply a directory with various files stored in it for the administration of the
project.</p>
