<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>In this panel you can scan a protein for residues that are candidates for
mutation, using homology modeling to identify variable or conserved residues,
solvent-accessible surface area to identify surface residues, distances to
identify contacts with other residues, and manual selection. The mutations can
then be defined and applied to produce mutated structures. Mutations are applied
independently to produce a set of structures with single mutations.
</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Residue Scanning Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Residue Scanning</span> 
panel:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Choose <span class="GUI">Applications &rarr; BioLuminate &rarr; Residue
Scanning &rarr; Perform Calculations</span> in the main window.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Residue Scanning Panel</h2> 

<p>The basic workflow is as follows:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Display the structure in the Workspace and analyze it to identify
the residues (<span class="GUI">Analyze Workspace</span>).
</p></li>
<li><p>Mark residues for mutation by checking the box in the <span
class="GUI">Mutate</span> column.
</p></li>
<li><p>Choose the mutations for these residues by clicking in the <span
class="GUI">Mutations</span> column of the table and selecting from the option
menu that is displayed. </p></li>
<li><p>Click <span class="GUI">Start</span>, make job settings, and start the
job. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The results are incorporated into the project as new entries. 
</p>

<p>A structure is produced for each mutation, and the structures
are incorporated into the project as new entries when the job finishes. As the
time taken scales linearly with the number of mutated structures produced, you
should consider carefully how many mutations you make. The number of mutation
sites and the total number of mutations (structures generated) is reported below
the table. Only one site is mutated at a time, so the number of structures is
linear in both the number of sites mutated and the number of mutations at each
site.
</p>

<p>You can also use suggestions from homology models for the residues to mutate,
based on variability or conservation at residue postions, or on solvent
accessibility or side-chain interactions. This is done in the <span
class="GUI">Homology Suggestions</span> tab:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Run a search for homologs (<span class="GUI">Run a Blast Search</span>)
and align the homologs (<span class="GUI">Align Homologs</span>).
</p></li>
<li><p>Specify the criteria for automatic selection of residues, in the 
<span class="GUI">Selection by homology criteria</span> and <span
class="GUI">Parent structure 3D criteria</span> sections. 
</p></li>
<li><p>Click <span class="GUI">Select in the Residues Tab</span>.</p>
<p>The <span class="GUI">Residues</span> tab is displayed and the residues are
selected in the table. You can then mark them for mutation. The default
selection of mutations is based on the variations seen in the homologs.
</p></li>
</ol>
