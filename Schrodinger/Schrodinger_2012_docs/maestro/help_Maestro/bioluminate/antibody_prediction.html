<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This panel provides a set of tools for prediction of the variable loop (CDR)
region of an antibody. It includes:
<ul>
<li>Automated identification of the six CDR region loops based on sequence</li>
<li>Prediction of the loops using lookup tables and rules derived from an
analysis of antibodies in the PDB (based on a new analysis from 2010)</li>
<li>Optional refinement of the loops where lookup is difficult, primarily for H3 
and possibly H2.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Antibody Prediction Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Antibody Prediction</span> 
panel:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Choose <span class="GUI">Applications &rarr; BioLuminate &rarr; Antibody
Modeling &rarr; Prediction</span> in the main window.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Antibody Prediction Panel</h2> 

<p>The basic procedure for running a prediction using a homology model is as
follows:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Import the sequences for the light and heavy chains: Click the part of
the diagram for the region you want to import, and choose a source from the list
that is displayed.</p> 
<p>A dialog box is displayed, in which you can provide the sequence, either
directly or from a structure. The diagram is colored for the loop that you
choose once you have imported a sequence.
</p></li>
<li><p>Set up the antibody databases that you want to use to search for homologs
for the framework region and the loops. Click <span class="GUI">Configure Active
Databases</span> in the <span class="GUI">Framework Search</span> tab, add
databases and select them in the table.
</p></li>
<li><p>Select <span class="GUI">Homology</span> and run the homology search by
clicking <span class="GUI">Search</span>. </p> 
<p>The results are listed in the table.
</p></li>
<li><p>Select the homolog you want to use for the framework region, and click
<span class="GUI">Accept</span>. 
</p></li>
<li><p>(Optional) In the <span class="GUI">Basic Loop Model</span> tab, select
the loop cluster you want to use for each loop in the model by clicking <span
class="GUI">View Clusters</span>, and choosing a cluster in the <span
class="GUI">Loop Clusters</span> panel. </p>
<p>By default a cluster is chosen automatically, based on similarity, then
cluster size.
</p></li>
<li><p>(Optional) Set the number of models of the antibody that you want to
generate. 
</p></li>
<li><p>Click <span class="GUI">Generate Initial Models</span> to generate the
models.
</p></li>
<li><p>(Optional) If you think that the H3 loop needs further refinement, select
it in the <span class="GUI">Advanced Loop Model</span> tab, and click <span
class="GUI">Run Prime</span>.  See the guidelines below. 
</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The models are added to the Project Table. 
</p>

<p>You can also use coordinates from existing structures instead of homology
models, for example if you want to vary just one of the loops. The procedure is
similar to that given above.
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Import the sequences for the light and heavy chains: Click the part of
the diagram for the region you want to import, and choose a source from the list
that is displayed.</p> 
<p>A dialog box is displayed, in which you can provide the sequence, either
directly or from a structure. The diagram is colored for the loop that you
choose once you have imported a sequence.
</p></li>
<li><p>Set up the antibody databases that you want to use to search for homologs
for the loops. Click <span class="GUI">Configure Active
Databases</span> in the <span class="GUI">Framework Search</span> tab, add
databases and select them in the table.
</p></li>
<li><p>Select <span class="GUI">Input coordinates</span> and click
<span class="GUI">Accept</span>. 
</p></li>
<li><p>In the <span class="GUI">Basic Loop Model</span> tab, select the check
box in the <span class="GUI">Keep Input</span> column for the loops you want to
take from the input structure. 
</p></li>
<li><p>(Optional) In the <span class="GUI">Basic Loop Model</span> tab, select
the loop cluster you want to use for each loop that you model by clicking <span
class="GUI">View Clusters</span>, and choosing a cluster in the <span
class="GUI">Loop Clusters</span> panel. </p>
<p>By default a cluster is chosen automatically, based on similarity, then
cluster size.
</p></li>
<li><p>(Optional) Set the number of models of the antibody that you want to
generate. 
</p></li>
<li><p>Click <span class="GUI">Generate Initial Models</span> to generate the
models.
</p></li>
<li><p>(Optional) If you think that the H3 loop needs further refinement, select
it in the <span class="GUI">Advanced Loop Model</span> tab, and click <span
class="GUI">Run Prime</span>.  See the guidelines below. 
</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In many cases, the model based on homology is adequate, and no further
prediction is needed. The H3 loop, however, is often difficult to predict, and
may need more advanced refinement. Some general guidelines for when to refine a
loop with Prime in the <span class="GUI">Advanced Loop Model</span> tab are
given below:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the loop is long (9 residues or more) and the homology is good
(similarity above about 80%) then refinement with Prime is not usually
necessary.
</p></li>
<li><p>If the loop sequence similarity is less than 40%, the basic model quality 
usually is very poor and a Prime refinement is recommended. 
</p></li>
<li><p>The quality of the Prime refinement is greater for shorter loops.
</p></li>
<li><p>When building a new H3 loop with new sequences on the native (crystal)
structure of an antibody, Prime refinement is recommended. 
</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Input area</h3>
<p>This area displays a diagram of the antibody. Clicking on the light variable
or heavy variable region in the diagram displays a menu, from which you can
choose the source of the sequence for this region. The choices are:
</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="GUI">Browse for File</span>&mdash;Open a file browser in which
you can navigate to the desired location and select the file that contains the
sequence.</li>

structure that is displayed in the Workspace.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">From Selected Entries in the Project
Table</span>&mdash;Use the sequence from the entries that are selected in the
Project Table.</li>
<li><span class="GUI">From PDB ID</span>&mdash;Use the sequence from the
specified PDB ID. Opens the <span class="GUI">Enter PDB ID</span> dialog box, in
which you can enter the PDB ID of the sequence. The sequence is retrieved from a
local copy of the PDB if it is available, or from the RCSB web site, depending
on the preference set for PDB retrieval. </li>
<li><span class="GUI">Enter/Paste New Sequence</span>&mdash;Type or paste in the
sequence. Opens the <span class="GUI">Sequence Editor</span> dialog box, in
which you can name the sequence and type it or paste it in, as a string of
single-letter codes.  </li>
</ul>

<a name="feature2"></a>
<h3>Framework Search tab</h3>
<p>In this tab you define the coordinates that will be used for the framework
regions. You can either use input coordinates from an existing structure, or
search for homologs for the heavy and light chains in your choice of antibody
databases.
</p>
<dl>

<dt><span class="GUI">Configure Active Databases</span> button</dt>

databases are the ones that are searched for templates, and are used for both
the framework regions and the CDR regions of the variable domains. Opens the
<span class="GUI">Database Configuration</span> dialog box, in which you can add
databases to the list, remove them from the list, and mark them as active. All
databases that you select as active are searched when you run a search for
homologs.

buttons are active. </li>
<li><span class="GUI">Input coordinates</span>&mdash;Use the coordinates of the
input structure for the framework region. The sequences that you imported for
the light and heavy regions must be associated with a structure. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Advanced Loop Model tab</h3>
<p>In this tab you can run a more accurate and detailed loop prediction. These
predictions can take hours for each loop. It is not usually necessary to run
an advanced loop prediction for any of the loops except the H3 loop. The H3 loop
is selected by default for an advanced prediction, as it is the hardest loop to
predict. The results are returned to the Project Table as new structures. </p>

<p>The input structure for the loop prediction is always the structure that came
from the <span class="GUI">Basic Loop Model</span> tab. This means that you
cannot do sequential loop predictions in this panel, but you can use the 
<a href="../prime/refine_panel.html"><span class="GUI">Refinement</span>
panel</a> to predict more than one loop. However, it is expected that the main
use of this tab is to predict a single loop.

guidelines on refining a loop in this tab.
