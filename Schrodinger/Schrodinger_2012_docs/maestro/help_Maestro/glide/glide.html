<h2>Summary</h2>
<br />
<p>Glide (Grid-based LIgand Docking with Energetics) searches for favorable
interactions between one or more typically small ligand molecules and a
typically larger receptor molecule, usually a protein. Each ligand must be a
single molecule, while the receptor may include more than one molecule, e.g., a
protein and a cofactor.  Glide can be run in rigid or flexible docking modes;
the latter automatically generates conformations for each input ligand. The
combination of a ligand conformation (for rigid docking, the input conformation;
for flexible docking, a generated conformation) with its position and
orientation is referred to as a <i>ligand pose</i>.</p>

<p>The ligand poses that Glide generates pass through a series of
hierarchical filters that evaluate the ligand's interaction with the
receptor.  The initial filters test the spatial fit of the ligand to
the defined active site, and examine the complementarity of
ligand-receptor interactions using a grid-based method patterned after
the empirical ChemScore function (Eldridge et al., <i>J.Comput. Aided
Mol. Des.</i> <b>1997</b>, <i>11</i>, 425-445).</p>

<p>Poses that pass these initial screens enter the final stage of the algorithm,
which involves evaluation and minimization of a grid approximation to the
OPLS-AA nonbonded ligand-receptor interaction energy.</p>

<p>Final scoring, which by default uses Schr&ouml;dinger's proprietary
GlideScore multi-ligand scoring function, is then carried out on the
energy-minimized poses.  Finally, if GlideScore was selected as the scoring
function, a composite <i>Emodel</i> score is used to rank the ligand poses and
to select which pose (or poses, if so specified) for a given ligand will be
reported to the user.  Emodel combines GlideScore, the nonbonded interaction
energy, and, for flexible docking, the excess internal energy of the generated
ligand conformation.</p>

<h2>Using Glide</h2>

<p>The Glide task most frequently performed is ligand docking. The
grid files produced by a single receptor grid generation task can
be used for any number of jobs docking ligands to that receptor.
Before generating receptor grids, it is strongly recommended that
you prepare the protein. Therefore, the first steps of
a typical project beginning
with an unprepared protein-ligand complex structure (e.g., from PDB)
might proceed using the Glide panels as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Prepare the protein using the
<a href="../workflows/protein_preparation.html">Protein Preparation Wizard</a>
In this process, you should check the correctness of formal charges and bond
orders in the ligand, cofactors, and nonstandard residues.</p></li>

<li><p>With the prepared receptor-ligand complex in the Workspace, use the <a
href="receptor_grid_generation.html">Receptor Grid Generation Panel</a> to
specify settings, optionally define Glide constraints, and start the receptor
grid generation job.</p></li>

<li><p>Prepare the ligands using <a href="../ligprep/ligprep.html">LigPrep</a>,
to ensure that the structures are all-atom, minimized 3D structures.
</p></li>

<li><p>Specify the base name for the receptor grid files you want to use in the
<a href="ligand_docking.html">Ligand Docking Panel</a>, and use the other
settings and options in the panel to set up and start a ligand docking job. As
many docking jobs as you want can be set up in this panel, using the current
receptor grids or specifying a different set of grids to use.</p></li> 
</ol>
