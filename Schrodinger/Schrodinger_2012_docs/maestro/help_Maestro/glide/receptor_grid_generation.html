<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>The <span class="GUI">Receptor Grid Generation</span> panel is used to
specify a receptor structure and set up the grid generation job.  This job
creates the grid files, which represent the active site of the receptor for Glide
ligand docking jobs.</p>
<p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Receptor Grid Generation Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Receptor Grid Generation</span> panel, do one
of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Applications &rarr; Glide &rarr; Receptor Grid
Generation</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">Tasks &rarr; Docking &rarr; Grid
Generation</span>.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Using the Receptor Grid Generation Panel</h2>

<p>Glide (Grid-based Ligand Docking with Energetics) searches for favorable
interactions between one or more typically small ligand molecules and a
typically larger receptor molecule, usually a protein. The shape and
properties of the receptor are represented on a grid by several different
sets of fields that provide progressively more accurate scoring of the
ligand poses. The options in each tab of the panel allow you
to define the receptor structure by excluding any cocrystallized ligand
that may be present, determine the position and size of the active site
as it will be represented by receptor grids, and set up Glide constraints.
Ligand docking jobs cannot be performed until receptor grids have been
generated.
</p>

<p>Receptor grid generation requires a &quot;prepared&quot; structure:
an all-atom structure with appropriate bond orders and formal charges.
In most cases, the preparation process can be performed automatically
using the <a href="../workflows/protein_preparation.html">Protein Preparation
Wizard</a>.
</p>

<p>With the prepared structure in the Workspace, use the <span
class="GUI">Receptor Grid Generation</span> panel to set up the receptor grid
generation job.  When you have completed your setup, you can click the <span
class="GUI">Start</span> button in the lower left corner of the panel.  This
opens the <span class="GUI">Receptor Grid Generation - Start</span> dialog box,
which has two sections:</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="GUI">Output</span></li>
<li><span class="GUI">Job</span></li>
</ul>

<p>The <span class="GUI">Output</span> section contains the <span
class="GUI">Directory for grid files</span> text box and <span
class="GUI">Browse</span> button for specifying the directory to which output
grid files are written.  By default, grid files are written to the current
working directory.  It also contains a <span class="GUI">Compress</span> option,
which can be used to compress the grid-related files into a <code>.zip</code>
archive. </p>

<p>The <span class="GUI">Job</span> section contains the standard controls,
<span class="GUI">Name</span>, <span class="GUI">Host</span>,
and <span class="GUI">Username</span>, which are described in the
<a href="../misc/job_start_db.html">Start Dialog Box</a> topic. 
In addition, it has a <span class="GUI">Standard Names</span> option menu, which
allows you to choose a name that is composed of various parameters from the
calculation, and a Compose button, which allows you to select a file name or a
job name from the current project, and edit it to form a job name.
You can also set the title of the entry in the <span class="GUI">Entry
Title</span> text box.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can click <span class="GUI">Write</span> to write the
input files without starting the job. The dialog box that opens has the same
<span class="GUI">Standard Names</span> option menu, <span
class="GUI">Name</span> text box, and <span class="GUI">Entry title</span> text
box, and <span class="GUI">Compress</span> option that appear in the <span
class="GUI">Start</span> dialog box. It also has a <span
class="GUI">Browse</span> button that you can use to navigate to a location for
the input file.
</p>

<p>To restore the default settings in all tabs, 
click <span class="GUI">Reset</span>.</p>

<h2>Receptor Grid Generation Panel Features</h2>

<p>The <span class="GUI">Receptor Grid Generation</span> panel
contains four tabs, which are described in full in separate topics:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="grid_receptor.html"><span class="GUI">Receptor</span> tab</a>&mdash;
Use this tab to define the receptor (by identifying the Workspace ligand, if one
is present) and optionally to scale the van der Waals radii of receptor
atoms.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="grid_site.html"><span class="GUI">Site</span> tab</a>&mdash;
Use this tab to determine the position and size of the volume for which grids
will be generated, representing the active site of the receptor.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="grid_constraints.html"><span class="GUI">Constraints</span> tab</a>&mdash;
Use this tab to designate certain receptor atoms (H-bond/metal constraints)
or regions (hydrophobic constraints) for ligand-receptor interactions that you
can then choose to require during docking jobs.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="grid_rotatable_groups.html"><span class="GUI">Rotatable
Groups</span></a> &mdash;
Use this tab to specify groups that should be treated as rotatable in the grid
generation. These groups are currently restricted to hydroxyls in Ser, Thr, and
Tyr, and thiols in Cys.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="grid_excluded_volumes.html"><span class="GUI">Excluded
Volumes</span></a>&mdash;
Use this tab to set up regions of space in which the ligand is penalized during
docking.
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, there are three action buttons at the bottom of the panel:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="GUI">Start</span>&mdash;opens the <span
class="GUI">Start</span> dialog box, in which you make job-related settings and
start the grid generation job. See the <a href="../misc/job_start_db.html">Start
dialog box</a> topic for more information.</p></li>

<li><p><span class="GUI">Write</span>&mdash;write a Glide input file to the
current working directory, but do not run the job. You can then run the job from
the command line with the <span class="GUI">glide</span> command.</p></li>

<li><p><span class="GUI">Reset</span>&mdash;Resets the options in all the tabs
to the default values.</p></li>
</ul>
