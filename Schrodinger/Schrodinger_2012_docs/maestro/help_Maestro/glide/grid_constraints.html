<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>The <span class="GUI">Constraints</span> tab of the <span
class="GUI">Receptor Grid Generation</span> panel is used to define Glide
constraints for the receptor grids to be generated.  Glide constraints are
receptor-ligand interactions that you believe to be important to the binding
mode. Up to ten constraints can be defined in a grid generation job.  When you
run Glide docking jobs, you can select as required interactions a subset of the
constraints defined in the receptor grids, up to a limit of four.  By setting
such requirements, you can often significantly enrich the final results and
speed up docking, as Glide is able to discard ligands, conformations, or
poses that do not meet these criteria early on in their evaluation for docking
suitability.</p>

<p>
There are three types of constraints available: positional constraints, NOE
constraints, H-bond/metal constraints, and hydrophobic constraints.  A
positional constraint is a requirement that an atom in the ligand occupy a
sphere whose center is at a particular position. An NOE constraint is similar to
a positional constraint, requiring that an atom in the ligand occupy a spherical
shell centered at a particular position. It only differs from a positional
constrint in having a smaller sphere from which the ligand atom is exlcuded. An
H-bond or metal constraint is a requirement that a ligand atom interact with a
specified receptor atom (or one related to it by symmetry), by either a hydrogen
bond or a metal-ligand interaction.  A hydrophobic constraint is a requirement
that a user-defined number of hydrophobic heavy atoms in the ligand occupy a
hydrophobic region in the active site.
</p>

<p>The H atoms in flexible receptor groups cannot be used for constraints.

<h2>Constraints Tab Features</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="#feature1">Defined constraints counter</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature2"><span class="GUI">Positional/NOE</span> subtab</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature3"><span class="GUI">H-bond/Metal</span> subtab</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature4"><span class="GUI">Hydrophobic</span> subtab</a></li>
</ul>

<a name="feature1"></a>
<h3>Defined Constraints Counter</h3>

<p>The total number of constraints that have been defined so far is
displayed at the top of the tab:</p>

<p><i>N</i><span class="GUI"> constraints have been defined (limit is
10 total)</span>
</p>

<p>The number <i>N</i> is the sum of the numbers of positional or NOE,
H-bond/metal, and hydrophobic constraints. These numbers are displayed in
parentheses in the tabs of each subtab.</p>

<a name="feature2"></a>
<h3>Positional/NOE Subtab</h3>

<p>This subtab provides tools for defining positional and NOE (nuclear
Overhauser effect) constraints. Positional constraints are defined as spheres 
that specified atoms of the ligands must occupy. NOE constraints are similarly
defined as spherical shells (the region between two spheres) that specified
atoms of the ligands must occupy.</p>

</ul>

<dl>
<a name="feature2.1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Positions</span> table</dt>
<dd><p>
This table displays the positional constraints you have chosen, giving the name
and coordinates of the sphere center. For positional constraints a maximum
distance is shown, which is the radius of the constraint sphere; for NOE
constraints a minimum and a maximum distance are shown, and in addition a check
box in the NOE column is selected. The coordinates and the radius are given in
angstroms.  You can select a single constraint in the table, and edit the
coordinates and radii of the spheres by clicking in the table cell and changing
the value, or delete the constraint by clicking the <span
class="GUI">Delete</span> button.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature2.2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Show markers</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>
This option is selected by default. The selected constraint is marked by a
yellow sphere. The other positional constraints are marked by red spheres.
Deselect this option to remove the markers.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature2.3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Label positions</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>
This option is selected by default. If <span class="GUI">Show
markers</span> is selected, this option displays the name of the constraint in
the Workspace. The labels are colored the same as the constraints.
Deselect this option to remove the labels.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature2.4"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">New</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>
To add a positional constraint or an NOE constraint, click the <span
class="GUI">New</span> button. This button opens the <span class="GUI">New
position</span> dialog box, in which you can pick atoms with the standard
<a href="../misc/picking_controls.html">picking controls</a> to
define a position; name the constraint; specify the radius for a positional
constraint, select an option to specify that the constraint is an NOE constraint
and provide the minimum and maximum distances.  The position is the centroid of
the selected atoms, and must be inside the enclosing box. While picking is in
progress, the constraint is marked with a gray sphere. If you make the
constraint an NOE constraint, both spheres are displayed. When you click OK, the
constraint is added to the table if it is inside the enclosing box; otherwise a
warning is displayed. 
</p></dd>

<a name="feature2.5"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Delete</span> and
<span class="GUI">Delete All</span> buttons</dt>
<dd><p>
To delete a single positional constraint, select it in the table
and click the <span class="GUI">Delete</span> button.
To delete all the listed constraints, click the
<span class="GUI">Delete All</span> button.

<h3>H-bond/Metal Subtab</h3>

<p>The <span class="GUI">H-bond/Metal</span> subtab contains controls
for setting up hydrogen-bonding or metal constraints:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#feature3.1"><span class="GUI">Receptor atoms</span> table</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature3.2"><span class="GUI">Pick atoms</span> option</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature3.3"><span class="GUI">Show markers</span> option</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature3.4"><span class="GUI">Label atoms</span> option</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature3.5"><span class="GUI">Delete</span>
and <span class="GUI">Delete All</span> buttons</a></li>
</ul>

<dl>

<a name="feature3.1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Receptor atoms</span> table</dt>
<dd>
<p>As you select atoms in the receptor, they appear in this table. Each
constraint is identified by a name and an atom specification. A default
constraint name is supplied. You can change the name by editing the table
cell. The atom specification is given in the following format:</p>
<pre>
atom_number:chain: residue_name residue_number : atom_name : symmetry_set
</pre>
<p>where</p>
<ul>
<li><tt>atom_number</tt> = Maestro atom number</li>
<li><tt>chain</tt> = chain name</li>
<li><tt>residue_number</tt> = residue number + insertion code</li>
<li><tt>atom_name</tt> = PDB atom name</li>
<li><tt>symmetry_set</tt> = atom name or symmetry-equivalent atom set</li>
</ul>

<p>For example:</p>
<p><span class="GUI">341:C:ASN 239 : OD1: OD1</span></p>
<p>If the picked atom is part of a symmetry-equivalent set,
its identification is followed by square brackets
enclosing the number and name of each atom in the set,
separated by commas:<p>
<p><span class="GUI">2203:C:GLU 192 : OE2:[2203: OE2,2202: OE1]</span>
</p>

<p>Symmetry can be turned on or off by selecting or clearing the check box in
the <span class="GUI">Use Symmetry</span> column. If you clear the check box,
only the atom that you pick is used for the constraint, and the symmetry
information is removed from the <span class="GUI">Atom</span> column. Symmetry
is on by default.
</p>

</dd>

<a name="feature3.2"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Pick atoms</span></dt>
<dd><p>
When this option is selected, you can define H-bond/metal constraints by picking
appropriate atoms in the receptor, which must be displayed in the Workspace.  To
define hydrogen bonds, pick any polar H, N, or O atom in the receptor.
(The atom is identified in the status bar when the pointer is over the atom,
as described in the <a href="../workspace/statusbar.html">Status Bar</a> topic.)
Glide automatically identifies symmetry-equivalent atoms as well, for example
the other oxygen in a carboxylate group. The symmetry can be turned on or off in
the <span class="GUI">Use Symmetry</span> column. If it is on, any one of the
symmetry-equivalent atoms will satisfy the constraint. If it is off, the atom
that you picked is used for the constraint. 
To define metal sites, pick the metal atom.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature3.3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Show markers</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>
This option is selected by default. A cross and padlock appear next to each atom
picked, colored light blue for the selected constraint (the last one picked),
and red for unselected constraints. If the picked atom is one of a set of
symmetry-equivalent atoms, all the atoms in the set are marked. Deselect this
option to remove the markers.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature3.4"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Label atoms</span> option</dt>
<dd><p>
This option is selected by default. If <span class="GUI">Show
markers</span> is selected, this option displays the name of the constraint in
the Workspace. The labels are colored the same as the constraints.
Deselect this option to remove the labels.
</p></dd>

<h3>Hydrophobic Subtab</h3>
<p>
A hydrophobic constraint is a hydrophobic region of the receptor
that must be occupied by one or more hydrophobic heavy atoms in the ligand.
In the <span class="GUI">Hydrophobic</span>
subtab of the <span class="GUI">Constraints</span> tab,
you can locate hydrophobic cells and define hydrophobic
constraint regions.

<dt><span class="GUI">Locate Hydrophobic Cells</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Clicking this button generates a hydrophobic map of the active site.
You must generate a hydrophobic map before you can define the constraints.
The map is generated by the Hydrophobic/philic Surfaces graphics tool.
For more information about this tool, see the
<a href="../surfaces/hppmap_panel.html">Hydrophobic/philic Surfaces Panel</a>
topic.</p>
<p>
The job takes a few minutes; when it finishes, hydrophobic regions in and near
the active site should be populated with groups of hydrophobic cells, shown as
translucent gray cubes. If you do not see any cubes, the receptor might not have
hydrophobic regions in the active site, or the hydrophobic potential for each
cube might be below the display threshold. In the latter case, you can adjust
the threshold with the <span class="GUI">Threshold phobic potential</span>
slider.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature4.2"></a>
<dt>Job status button</dt>
<dd><p>When the Locate Hydrophobic Cells job has been launched and is running,
the pink job status icon at the upper right of the <span class="GUI">Setup</span>
section turns green and spins. When the job has finished, the icon turns pink
again and stops spinning.
