<ul>
<h4>Spreadsheet</h4>

<li><p>The <span class="GUI">Chemistry</span> menu has been renamed <span
class="GUI">Structure</span>. With it, the <span class="GUI">Chemistry
Filter</span> dialog box has been renamed <span class="GUI">Structure
Filter</span> and has been moved from the <span class="GUI">Data</span> menu to
the <span class="GUI">Structure</span> menu. Some menu items have been renamed
as a consequence of the change.
</p></li> 

<li><p>Structure names can be replaced with the values of a selected property.
</p></li> 

<li><p>Structures that are found to be invalid on import are marked as invalid
in the <span class="GUI">Structure</span> column. You can select these
structures with <span class="GUI">View &rarr; Select Rows with Invalid
Structures</span>. (Update 2)
</p></li> 

<li><p>Hydrogen atoms in the 2D structures can be shown or hidden with a new
item on the <span class="GUI">Structure</span> menu.
</p></li> 

<li><p>The <span class="GUI">Property Calculator</span> panel has been renamed
<span class="GUI">Calculator</span>.
</p></li> 

<li><p>Properties are exported in the order in which they apppear in the
spreadsheet (or view). 
</p></li> 

<li><p>You can restrict the list of properties available for plotting in a chart
by selecting the desired properties in the current view before plotting.
</p></li> 

<li><p>You can add an empty row or an empty column to the spreadsheet from
the <span class="GUI">Edit</span> menu or using the toolbar. 
</p></li> 

<li><p>You can select the columns to show in the view in the <span
class="GUI">Manage Properties</span> dialog box, which you open from the 
<span class="GUI">View</span> menu.
</p></li> 

<li><p>You can copy the selection from the spreadsheet to the clipboard. A
rectangular region containing the selection is what is copied. 
</p></li> 

<li><p>Class values in partitions can be edited.
</p></li> 

<li><p>An <span class="GUI">Apply</span> button has been added to the <span
class="GUI">Partition Filter</span> dialog box, so you can apply a succession of 
filters.
</p></li> 

<li><p>The 2D structures of the matches can be aligned to a reference structure
after a substructure query. The aligned atoms are those in the substructure. 
</p></li> 

<li><p>The number of decimal places displayed in the spreadsheet can be set as a
preference. (Update 2)
</p></li> 


<h4>Applications</h4>

<li><p>The layout of many of the model-building dialog boxes has been improved,
by creating tabs for the job setup and the results rather than displaying them
in a single window. (Update 2)
</p></li> 

<li><p>Filling in holes in an existing library along with property optimization
can be done with a new application, <code>canvasLibOpt</code>, and the
corresponding panel on the <span class="GUI">Applications</span> menu, 
<span class="GUI">Hole-Filling and Library Optimization</span>.</p>
<p>In Update 2, you can use existing property filters.
</p></li> 

<li><p>A set of structures can be decomposed into its unique (ring-containing)
scaffolds with a new application, <code>canvasScaffold</code>, and the
corresponding panel on the <span class="GUI">Applications</span> menu, <span
class="GUI">Scaffold Decomposition</span>. Once scaffolds are located, a this
set can be matched against a set of structures to locate the structures that
match each scaffold.
</p></li> 

<li><p>QikProp descriptors have been added to the <span class="GUI">Molecular
Descriptors</span> panel. (Update 2)
</p></li> 

<li><p>Kernel-based partial least squares regression is now available as a new
application on the <span class="GUI">Applications</span> menu.
Several improvements have been made to the Kernel-Based Partial Least
Squares application in Update 2: uncertainty column in results, color scale
limits, sorting, layout.
</p></li> 

<li><p>Shape screening now uses pharmacophore types by default. This is a new
option, set in the <span class="GUI">Advanced Options</span> dialog box. (Update
2)
</p></li> 

<li><p>When using a view for input to an application, you can choose to use the
rows or the columns from the view, or both. (Update 2)
</p></li> 


<li><p>The output rows from canvasFPMatrix can be sorted, and only the top rows
returned. For each row, the top columns can be returned. 
</p></li> 

<li><p>The Shannon entropy can be used to remove properties in the <span
class="GUI">Feature Selection</span> dialog box, as well as or instead of the
percent identity. (Update 2)
</p></li> 

<li><p>In a self-organizing map, the value used to determine the color of a cell
can be displayed in the cell.
</p></li> 

<li><p>You can save an image of a self-organizing map.
</p></li> 

<li><p>In the hierarchical clustering dendrogram, you can color the leaf nodes
by cluster membership or by the value of a property.
</p></li> 

<li><p>When exporting clusters, you can export just the centroids to a file or a
view. 
</p></li> 

<li><p>You can save an image of the hierarchical clustering dendrogram.
</p></li> 

<li><p>The data set selection and property selection tools have been improved. 
</p></li>

<li><p>You can set a preference to incorporate jobs automatically, rather than
incorporate each job manually. (Update 2)
</p></li> 


<h4>Projects</h4>

<li><p>You can export a saved view from a Canvas project from the command line,
with canvasProjectDB. 
</p></li> 

<li><p>Files in SD format can be imported into Canvas when starting it from
the command line.
</p></li> 

<li><p>When exporting properties, you can choose to autoscale them so the mean
is zero and the standard deviation is 1. (Update 2)
</p></li>
