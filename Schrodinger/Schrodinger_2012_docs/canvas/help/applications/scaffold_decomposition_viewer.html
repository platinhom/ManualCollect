<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This panel displays the results of a scaffold decomposition job. The
scaffolds are displayed, sorted by the number of rings or ring systems, along
with a representation of the property distribution of the structures that
contain the scaffolds. 
</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Scaffold Decomposition of <i>jobname</i> Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Scaffold Decomposition of <i>jobname</i></span> 
panel:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">View</span> from the shortcut menu for 
<i>jobname</i> under <span class="GUI">Scaffold Decomposition</span> in the
<span class="GUI">Project View</span> panel.</p></li>
</ul>

<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Scaffold Decomposition of <i>jobname</i> Panel</h2> 

<p>The Scaffold Decomposition of jobname panel shows the 2D structures of the
scaffolds in a table. The scaffolds can be classified by the number of rings in
each scaffold, or by the number of ring systems. The scaffolds for a given
classification are shown on the same table row. You can select scaffolds in the
table, and limit the display to show only those scaffolds. Each time you limit
the display (or remove the limits), that view of the table is stored, and you
can use the arrow buttons to step through these views. If you want to see all
the subscaffolds or superscaffolds of a particular scaffold, right-click in
its table cell and choose the appropriate command.
</p>
<p>The table also shows the property distribution of the structures that contain
each scaffold, for a property that you can choose from the Property option
menu. The average, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values of the
property are displayed to the right of the option menu.  The property
distribution is displayed for each scaffold as a &quot;stick spectrum&quot; in a
bar that represents the full range of the property. For each structure there is
a vertical line at the property value for that structure. The average property
value is marked, and the region outside one standard deviation from the average
is colored if it contains vertical lines for property values.
</p>
<p>You can export the scaffolds to a structure file. The scaffolds are stored
internally as canonical SMILES strings, so if you choose Maestro or SD format
for the file, they are exported as 2D structures without hydrogens, except where
the hydrogens are part of the SMILES string.
</p>

<p>If you want to see the source structures for a set of scaffolds, select them
in the table and click <span class="GUI">Show Source Structures</span>. The
<span class="GUI">Source Structures</span> panel opens, and displays the
structures for those scaffolds, arranged in rows with the same classification as
for the scaffolds, and including the property distribution display. You can
export selected structures or all structures to a file. You can run an R-group
analysis on the selected structures or on all structures in the panel. If the
structures have more than one scaffold in common, you are prompted to choose the
scaffold you want to use for R-group analysis.

<ul>

<li><p><span class="GUI">Number of rings</span>&mdash;Assign scaffolds to rows
by the number of rings that they contain, counting fused rings as multiple
rings. For example, naphthalene is considered as containing two rings.
</p></li>

<li><p><span class="GUI">Number of ring systems</span>&mdash;Assign scaffolds to
rows by the number of ring systems they contain, counting fused rings as a
single ring system. For example, naphthalene is considered as containing a
single ring system.

<dt>Scaffolds table</dt>
<dd><p>This table displays the 2D structures of all the scaffolds, sorted by

<p>Each cell contains a scaffold 2D structure and a graphical representation of
the property chosen from the <span class="GUI">Property</span> option menu. In
this representation, the minimum property value is at the left, and the maximum
is at the right. The property value for each structure that contains the
scaffold is marked by a vertical line. The average value over all properties is
marked with an arrow at the top. The regions outside one standard deviation from
the average are colored if they contain property values for one or more
structures.</p>
<p>The table cells have a shortcut menu, which allows you to select all the
subscaffolds of the scaffold in the table cell, all its superscaffolds, or both.
