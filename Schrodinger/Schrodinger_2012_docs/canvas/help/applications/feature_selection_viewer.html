<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
</p>

<a name="opening"></a>
<h2>Opening the Feature Selection Viewer Panel</h2>

<p>To open the <span class="GUI">Feature Selection Viewer</span> 
panel:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose <span class="GUI">View</span> from the shortcut menu for the
chosen feature selection job under <span class="GUI">Feature Selection</span> in
the <span class="GUI">Project View</span> panel.</p></li>
</ul>

<a name="using"></a> 
<h2>Using the Feature Selection Viewer Panel</h2> 

<p>The initial set of properties displayed in the panel is selected from the
hierarchical clustering results, with Kelley criteria to choose the default
number of clusters. </p>
<p>To determine how well the selected properties (reduced list) represents the
orginal properties, multiple linear regression is performed for each property to
calculate an R^2 value for the fit of the property by the reduced list. First, a
principal components analysis is done on the reduced list and principal
components are selected to account for 95% of the variance. The X variables in
the PLS model are taken from the projection of the principal components onto the
property data from the reduced list, and the Y variable is the original
property. These R^2 values are reported in the second column of the <span
class="GUI">Original properties</span> table. 
</p>

<p>You can change the number of properties in the reduced list in several ways:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Select <span class="GUI">Number of clusters</span> and change the number
of clusters, then click <span class="GUI">Update Properties</span>.
</p></li>
<li><p>Select <span class="GUI">Maximum correlation</span> and change the value
of the maximum allowed correlation between properties on the reduced list, then
click <span class="GUI">Update Properties</span>.
</p></li>
<li><p>Select a property in either of the lists and click <span
class="GUI">Add</span> or <code>Remove</code>, then click <span
class="GUI">Update R^2</span>. 
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You might want to change the property manually if you have a preference for a
particular property. The property chosen from each cluster is the one that is
closest to the centroid. You might want to replace it with another property from
the same cluster. To do this, it is useful to sort the list of original
properties by the clustering order (right-click and choose <span
class="GUI">Sort by Cluster</span>), so that properties in the same cluster are
adjacent. It might also be useful to view the correlation matrix (click
<span class="GUI">Correlation Matrix</span>) for the original properties,
ordered by cluster, so that you can identify the properties that are in the same
cluster as the one you want to replace. With cluster ordering, the heat map
should have red diagonal blocks that mark the clusters. 
</p>

<p>You can also sort the lists, to order the structures alphabetically or by the
order produced by clustering, or in ascending or descending magnitudes of
R^2. To sort the lists, right click on the column heading and choose the desired
item from the shortcut menu.

<dl>

<a name="feature1"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Selection criterion</span> options</dt>
<dd><p>These options allow you to specify the reduced list by different
criteria. After you have made a change, you should click <span
class="GUI">Update Properties</span> to update the property lists and the R^2
values. 
</p>

<dl>

<dt><span class="GUI">Number of clusters</span> option and box</dt>
<dd><p>Select this option to take the reduced properties from the
clusters. Specify the number of clusters in the box. This is also the number of
properties in the reduced list. Each property in the reduced list is the
property that is closest to the centroid of the cluster. The default number of
clusters is chosen by Kelley criteria. The maximum correlation between the
reduced properties for the chosen number of clusters is shown in the <span
class="GUI">Maximum correlation</span> text box.
</p></dd>

<dt><span class="GUI">Maximum correlation</span>option and text box</dt>
<dd><p>Select this option to choose the reduced list by the degree of
correlation between the properties, and enter a value in the text box for the
maximum absolute value of the correlation matrix between the properties. The
value in this text box is updated to the nearest value that corresponds to a
particular number of clusters. It is also updated when you change the number of
clusters. 
</p></dd>

</dl>

</dd>

<a name="feature3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Update Properties</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Update the reduced list of properties after changing the selection
criterion, and recalculate the R^2 values.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature4"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Original properties</span> table</dt>
<dd><p>This table lists the properties that were selected for reduction in the
<span class="GUI">Feature Selection</span> dialog box. It also shows the R^2
value derived from a MLR fit of each property by the reduced list of
properties.</p>

<p>If you chose to remove properties from the list for which a specified
percentage of the values were identical, these properties are dimmed in the
list, and the cells in the <span class="GUI">R^2</span> column are colored
yellow and contain text describing the elimination criterion rather than a
numeric value. Likewise, if you chose to remove properties that did not meet the
Shannon entropy cutoff, the cells are colored magenta and appropriate text is
used instead of a value.  If you did not choose to remove such properties, the
cells in the <span class="GUI">R^2</span> column in which all values of the
property are identical are colored red and contain the text &quot;No
Variance&quot;.</p>

<p>Properties on this list that are also on the reduced list are dimmed, and
have a line of - characters instead of a numeric value in the <span
class="GUI">R^2</span> column.</p>

<p>You can select a property in the list and click <span class="GUI">Add</span>
to transfer it to the reduced list. If the property was originally on the
reduced list, the cyan coloring is removed. If not, the property is colored cyan
in both lists.</p>

<p>You can sort the table columns by right clicking on the heading and choosing
a sort option. The R^2 values can be sorted in ascending or descending
order. The property names can be sorted in alphabetical order (actually ASCII
sort order) or in cluster order (as determined by the hierarchical clustering).
</p></dd>

<a name="feature3"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Update R^2</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>Recalculate the R^2 values after manually adding or removing a property
from the reduced list.
</p></dd>

<a name="feature5"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Reduced list</span> table</dt>
<dd><p>Reduced list of properties that is intended to be representative of the
original list. You can select a property in the list and click <span
class="GUI">Remove</span> to transfer it to the original properties list.
If the property was manually added (colored cyan), the coloring is removed when
it is transferred back to the original properties list. If it was not, the
property is colored cyan in the original list. 
</p></dd>

<a name="feature6"></a>
<dt><span class="GUI">Correlation Matrix</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>There is one button for each list. Clicking the button displays the
correlation matrix for the list as a heat map. Opens the 
<a href="feature_selection_correlation_matrix.html"><span
class="GUI">Correlation Matrix</span> dialog box</a>.

<dt><span class="GUI">Filter Master View</span> button</dt>
<dd><p>In the master view, keep the properties in the reduced list visible, and
hide the remaining properties on the original list. This action has no effect on
properties that were not in the list selected for reduction. 
</p></dd>
