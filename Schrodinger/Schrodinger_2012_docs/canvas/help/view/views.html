<p>The view of the project data that you see in the main window is called the Master 
View.  This view of the project data contains all the data. It is the only view
that allows you to perform operations that result in permanent changes to the
project database, such as importing, deleting, and running applications. </p>

<p>You can create custom views of the data that show a snapshot of a particular
set of rows and columns arranged in a particular way. You might want to create a
custom view as after running a sort or filter, selecting points from a
chart, or  performing a logical operation between two views. Custom views can be
created from the Master View or from another custom view. You can also combine
two views with a logical operation. Custom views are read-only: you cannot
change the data from a custom view. 
</p>

<p>If you make changes to a custom view, they are not preserved if
you close the view without saving them first.  Changes to the Master View are
completely transient, and are reverted when you perform an import or when you
close and reopen the project. 
</p>

<p>Custom views can be opened from the <span class="GUI">View</span> menu or
under the <span class="GUI">View</span> node in the <span class="GUI">Project
View</span> window. 
</p>

<p>Custom views are opened in a new window. The custom view window has a subset
of the menus that are present in the master view. The available menus are 
<a href="../edit/menu.html"><span class="GUI">Edit</span></a>, 
<a href="menu.html"><span class="GUI">View</span></a>, 
<a href="../structure/menu.html"><span class="GUI">Structure</span></a>, 
<a href="../data/menu.html"><span class="GUI">Data</span></a>, and
<a href="../chart/menu.html"><span class="GUI">Chart</span></a>.
