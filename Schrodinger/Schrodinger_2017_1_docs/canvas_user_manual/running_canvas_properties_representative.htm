        <h1 class="Title">Selecting Representative Properties in Canvas</h1>
        <p>Often, the set of molecular properties or descriptors that you obtain from various sources can have a high degree of correlation. For model-building, it is useful to remove the linear dependence in the properties, to speed up the calculation and to reduce numerical error. One way of doing this is to select a smaller set of properties that adequately represents the large set, in some measurable way. </p>
        <p>Canvas provides the ability to select a representative set of properties. The set is chosen by clustering the properties with a hierarchical clustering method, based on the correlation matrix. The distance between two properties is calculated as one minus the absolute value of the correlation matrix element. A default number of clusters is chosen using Kelley criteria <a class="Reference_Number MCXref xref xrefReference_Number" href="canvas_references.htm#canvas_references_3811068687_742779">[<span style="color: #0e6895;" class="mcFormatColor">4</span>]</a>, and the property that is nearest the centroid of each cluster is chosen as the representative property. The job to perform the clustering is set up in the <span class="GUI">Feature Selection</span> dialog box, which you open from the <span class="GUI">Applications</span> menu.</p>
        <p>To set up the job, choose a structure source from the <span class="GUI">Data set</span> option menu, enter a name for the results, and choose the property set that you want to select from. You should check the list for properties that are not relevant, such as an entry ID or possibly results from other jobs. The list of properties that you choose can be reduced by removing those that have mostly identical values. To do this, you can select <span class="GUI">Exclude properties whose values are identical in more than </span><i>N</i><span class="GUI"> % of molecules</span>, or <span class="GUI">Exclude properties with Shannon entropy lower than </span><i>X</i>. Click <span class="GUI">Compute</span> to run the job.</p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="feature_selection.png" style="margin: 2px;" />
        </p>
        <p>When the job finishes, you can view the results in the <span class="GUI">Feature Selection Viewer</span> panel, which you open by selecting <span class="GUI">View</span> from the shortcut menu for the feature selection job, under <span class="GUI">Feature Selection</span> in the <span class="GUI">Project View</span> panel. This panel lists the original set of properties and the reduced (representative) set of properties, and provides tools to change the selection of representative properties. </p>
        <p>To determine how well the selected properties (reduced list) represents the original properties, multiple linear regression is performed for each property to calculate an R<sup>2</sup> value for the fit of the property by the reduced list. First, a principal components analysis is done on the reduced list and principal components are selected to account for 95% of the variance. The X variables in the PLS model are taken from the projection of the principal components onto the property data from the reduced list, and the Y variable is the original property. These R<sup>2</sup> values are reported in the second column of the <span class="GUI">Original properties</span> table.</p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="feature_selection_viewer.png" style="margin: 2px;" />
        </p>
        <p>If when setting up the job, you chose to remove properties for which a specified percentage of the values were identical, these properties are dimmed in the <span class="GUI">Original properties</span> list, and the cells in the <span class="GUI">R^2</span> column are colored yellow and contain text describing the elimination criterion rather than a numeric value. Likewise, cells for properties that did not meet the Shannon entropy cutoff are colored magenta, with descriptive text. If you did not choose to remove such properties, the cells in the <span class="GUI">R^2</span> column in which all values of the property are identical are colored red and contain the text “Zero variance”.</p>
        <p>Properties on the original list that are also on the reduced list are dimmed, and have a line of - characters instead of a numeric value in the R^2 column. Properties that are manually transferred between lists (as described below) are colored cyan. </p>
        <p>You can change the number of properties in the reduced list in several ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p class="ListPara">Select <span class="GUI">Number of clusters</span> and change the number of clusters, then click <span class="GUI">Update Properties</span> to update the lists and the regression results.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p class="ListPara">Select <span class="GUI">Maximum correlation</span> and change the value of the maximum allowed correlation between properties on the reduced list, then click <span class="GUI">Update Properties</span>.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p class="ListPara">Select a property in either of the lists and click <span class="GUI">Add</span> or <span class="GUI">Remove</span>, then click <span class="GUI">Update R^2</span>.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can change the property manually if you have a preference for a particular property. The property chosen from each cluster is the one that is closest to the centroid. To replace it with another property from the same cluster, it is useful to sort the list of original properties by the clustering order (right-click and choose <span class="GUI">Sort by Cluster</span>), so that properties in the same cluster are adjacent. It might also be useful to view the correlation matrix (click <span class="GUI">Correlation Matrix</span>) for the original properties, ordered by cluster, so that you can identify the properties that are in the same cluster as the one you want to replace. With cluster ordering, the heat map of the correlation matrix should have red diagonal blocks that mark the clusters.</p>
