        <h1 class="Title">Running External Applications from Canvas</h1>
        <p>If you want to run an external application and incorporate the results into Canvas, you can do so with the <span class="GUI">External Application</span> dialog box, which you open from the <span class="GUI">Applications</span> menu.</p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="external_application.png" style="margin: 2px;" />
        </p>
        <p>In common with other applications panels, you can use the selected rows or the visible rows, a saved view, or the data set from a previous run for the structure input to the application. If the application requires certain properties as input, you can select the properties to use with the property selection tools in the <span class="GUI">Application input </span>section. The structures and properties are written to a file, which you can name in the <span class="GUI">Application input</span> section. The file is written to a special directory in the Canvas project, and the full path to the file is used when the command for the application is executed. You can choose a file format from the <span class="GUI">Format</span> option menu. The application must be able to read one of the formats on this option menu. </p>
        <p>The application can be specified in the <span class="GUI">Application</span> text box as a full path, or you can click <span class="GUI">Browse</span> and navigate to the application. If the application makes use of Schrödinger software, libraries, or APIs, you can select <span class="GUI">Invoke with $SCHRODINGER/run</span> so that the Schrödinger environment is set up automatically. </p>
        <p>If you want the results to be incorporated back into the Canvas project, select <span class="GUI">Incorporate</span> in the <span class="GUI">Application output</span> section and specify the name of a CSV file in the text box. In order to incorporate results into Canvas, the application must generate a CSV file that has a header row, the SMILES string for the structure in the first column, and the structure name in the second column. The following columns can contain the properties generated by the application. If the application cannot process one of the structures, it must still write a row for that structure in the CSV file, with the SMILES string, the structure name, and the correct number of commas. You can also display a text file in the <span class="GUI">Contents of</span> text area when the job finishes, by selecting <span class="GUI">Display contents of</span> and specifying the file name in the corresponding text box. As for the input file, the output file and the displayed file are written to a directory in the Canvas project, and the full path is used when the command is run. </p>
        <p>The default file names are constructed from the label given in the <span class="GUI">Save results as</span> text box. This label is used to identify the calculation in the <span class="GUI">Project View</span>, under <span class="GUI">External Application</span>. </p>
        <p>The command for running the application is specified in the <span class="GUI">Command</span> text area. You do not need to specify the path to the application, because it is specified in the <span class="GUI">Application</span> text box, and the path is prepended to the application name when the command is executed. Likewise, you do not need to specify the path to the input file or the output file, because the path is prepended to the file names. A sample command is given in the <span class="GUI">Command</span> text area, which you can edit to provide the correct syntax for running the command, including the method of specifying the input and output file. The names of these two files are automatically supplied and updated from the relevant text boxes in the <span class="GUI">Application input</span> and <span class="GUI">Application output</span> sections. </p>
        <p>All files must be specified as command arguments, because the command is not run in a shell. The application must therefore process all the arguments you give for the command, and not use shell redirection for input or output. </p>
        <p>If you choose to display the contents of a file in the panel, that file must appear in the command. The command can include other arguments used by the application, and it can specify other files needed by the application. Any files other than those specified in the panel must include the full path. </p>
        <p>When you are ready to run the application, click <span class="GUI">Compute</span>. The controls in the panel are made unavailable, except for the <span class="GUI">Stop</span> button. The panel must remain open until the run has finished. If you chose incorporation, the results are automatically incorporated into the Canvas project.</p>
        <p>If you want to run a similar job, or correct the settings, you can select <span class="GUI">Use settings from</span> and choose a run from the option menu. The panel is set up with the settings from the selected run, which you can change before clicking <span class="GUI">Compute</span>. This option does the same as cloning a job. </p>
