        <h1 class="Title">Scaffold Decomposition in Canvas</h1>
        <p>Another way of finding common structural features in a set of structures is to decompose each molecule into a set of scaffolds, then make a list for each scaffold of the structures that contain that scaffold. You can perform this scaffold decomposition in the <span class="GUI">Scaffold Decomposition</span> panel, which you open from the <span class="GUI">Applications</span> menu. In this panel you can choose the structure source from the <span class="GUI">Data set</span> option menu, and give a name to the results.</p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Common/scaffold_decomposition.png" style="margin: 2px;" />
        </p>
        <p>The decomposition is done by first removing side chains from all ring systems, to define the largest scaffold in the structure. This structure is then split into all possible subscaffolds by breaking bonds and removing linkers between rings, other than those in fused rings. The list of scaffolds is collated, and then for each scaffold, the structures that contain that scaffold are located and added to a list. </p>
        <p>When finding the structures that contain a scaffold, you can choose to match scaffolds to a fused ring system in a structure that contains the scaffold. This is called an “embedded match”, and you can allow them by selecting <span class="GUI">Allow embedded matches</span>. For example, if the list of scaffolds contains imidazole and benzimidazole, a structure that contains benzimidazole is included in the list of structures that contain the imidazole scaffold, if embedded matches are allowed. Identifying embedded matches takes substantially more time than not doing so. </p>
        <p>For more information on the process, see <a class="TopicLink MCXref xref xrefTopicLink" href="../canvas_command_reference/canvas_command_canvasScaffold.htm#canvas_command_2298859567_53979">
            canvasScaffold</a>.</p>
        <p>After the job finishes, you can view the results in the <span class="GUI">Scaffold Decomposition of </span><i class="UserReplace">jobname</i> panel, by right-clicking on the job and choosing <span class="GUI">View</span>. </p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Common/scaffold_decomposition_viewer.png" style="margin: 2px;" />
        </p>
        <p>The <span class="GUI">Scaffold Decomposition of </span><i class="UserReplace">jobname</i> panel shows the 2D structures of the scaffolds in a table. The scaffolds can be classified by the number of rings in each scaffold, or by the number of ring systems. The scaffolds for a given classification are shown on the same table row. You can select scaffolds in the table, and limit the display to show only those scaffolds. Each time you limit the display (or remove the limits), that view of the table is stored, and you can use the arrow buttons to step through these views. If you want to see all the subscaffolds or superscaffolds of a particular scaffold, right-click in its table cell and choose the appropriate command.</p>
        <p>The table also shows the property distribution of the structures that contain each scaffold, for a property that you can choose from the <span class="GUI">Property</span> option menu. The average, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values of the property are displayed to the right of the option menu. The property distribution is displayed for each scaffold as a “stick spectrum” in a bar that represents the full range of the property. For each structure there is a vertical line at the property value for that structure. The average property value is marked, and the region outside one standard deviation from the average is colored if it contains vertical lines for property values. </p>
        <p>You can export the scaffolds to a structure file. The scaffolds are stored internally as canonical SMILES strings, so if you choose Maestro or SD format for the file, they are exported as 2D structures without hydrogens, except where the hydrogens are part of the SMILES string. </p>

            <img src="../Resources/Images/Common/source_structures.png" style="margin: 2px;" />
        </p>
        <p>If you want to see the source structures for a set of scaffolds, select them in the table and click <span class="GUI">Show Source Structures</span>. The <span class="GUI">Source Structures </span>panel opens, and displays the structures for those scaffolds, arranged in rows with the same classification as for the scaffolds, and including the property distribution display. You can export selected structures or all structures to a file. You can run an R-group analysis on the selected structures or on all structures in the panel. If the structures have more than one scaffold in common, you are prompted to choose the scaffold you want to use for R-group analysis.</p>
