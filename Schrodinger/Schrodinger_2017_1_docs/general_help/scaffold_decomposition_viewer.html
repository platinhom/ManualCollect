        <h1 class="title">Scaffold Decomposition of jobname Panel</h1><a name="summary"></a>
        <p>This panel displays the results of a scaffold decomposition job. The scaffolds are displayed, sorted by the number of rings or ring systems, along with a representation of the property distribution of the structures that contain the scaffolds.</p>
        <h2><a name="using"></a>Using the Scaffold Decomposition of jobname Panel</h2>
        <p>The Scaffold Decomposition of jobname panel shows the 2D structures of the scaffolds in a table. The scaffolds can be classified by the number of rings in each scaffold, or by the number of ring systems. The scaffolds for a given classification are shown on the same table row. You can select scaffolds in the table, and limit the display to show only those scaffolds. Each time you limit the display (or remove the limits), that view of the table is stored, and you can use the arrow buttons to step through these views. If you want to see all the subscaffolds or superscaffolds of a particular scaffold, right-click in its table cell and choose the appropriate command.</p>
        <p>The table also shows the property distribution of the structures that contain each scaffold, for a property that you can choose from the Property option menu. The average, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values of the property are displayed to the right of the option menu. The property distribution is displayed for each scaffold as a "stick spectrum" in a bar that represents the full range of the property. For each structure there is a vertical line at the property value for that structure. The average property value is marked, and the region outside one standard deviation from the average is colored if it contains vertical lines for property values.</p>
        <p>You can export the scaffolds to a structure file. The scaffolds are stored internally as canonical SMILES strings, so if you choose Maestro or SD format for the file, they are exported as 2D structures without hydrogens, except where the hydrogens are part of the SMILES string.</p>
        <p>If you want to see the source structures for a set of scaffolds, select them in the table and click <span class="GUI">Show Source Structures</span>. The <span class="GUI">Source Structures</span> panel opens, and displays the structures for those scaffolds, arranged in rows with the same classification as for the scaffolds, and including the property distribution display. You can export selected structures or all structures to a file. You can run an R-group analysis on the selected structures or on all structures in the panel. If the structures have more than one scaffold in common, you are prompted to choose the scaffold you want to use for R-group analysis.</p>
