A report is displayed in the <span class="GUI">Current Status</span> section of the tab. This report tells you whether you have licenses installed, what kind of licenses they are, if the license server is running (if applicable).

                <p>The tools in the lower half of the panel allow you to set up licensing. There are several ways of adding licenses to a machine, depending on the situation. The options for adding licenses are available from the <span class="GUI">Add Licenses</span> option menu:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li value="1">
                        <p><span class="GUI">I have a key</span>
                        </p>
                        <p>This is the default option if you don't have valid licenses or don't have licenses at all and need to install new ones. When you purchase licenses or start an evaluation, you are sent a key by email. Copy and paste the key into the text box below, then click <span class="GUI">Install License</span>.</p>
                        <p><b>Note:</b> The current host is set up as a license server when you use this method of installation, unless you have licenses for specified machines (node-locked licenses). This is the normal scenario if you are doing an installation on a single machine, and don't have a special license server host. However, if you <i>do</i> have a license server host, you should ensure that you open this panel on that host to do the license installation.</p>
                        <p>The panel that opens when you click <span class="GUI">Install License</span> gives information about your computer name, address, and the license server ports used. You do not need to do anything with this information unless you need to change the ports; this is usually only necessary if you are managing licenses on a license server host. Click <span class="GUI">OK</span> in this panel to install the licenses. The licenses are downloaded from the web and license files are created and installed.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li value="2">
                        <p><span class="GUI">I have a license file</span>
                        </p>
                        <p>This option can be used if you already have valid licenses from a previous release and want to use them for a new release. On Mac computers, the license is in a standard location and is automatically detected.</p>
                        <p>To use the previous license, enter the name of the license file in the text box, or click <span class="GUI">Browse</span> to navigate to the license file. On Windows, the license file from the most recent previous release is detected. Click <span class="GUI">Install License</span> to install the license file as the license for the current release.</p>

                        <p>This option can be used if you have installed licenses on the server and now want to make them available on the computers that are served by the server (the clients). It does not matter whether the licenses are new or from a previous release.</p>
                        <p>Enter the host name of the license server in the text box, e.g. <code>myserver.mycompany.com</code>. If you know the port number (this is the LMGRD port shown when you installed the licenses on the server) you can enter it, otherwise the port will be detected when connecting to the server. Click <span class="GUI">Save Server</span> to save the server information, which is placed in a "stub" license file.</p>
