        <p>Analyze the results of FEP calculations generated from an FEP map to produce estimates of the relative free energies for the perturbations and binding free energies for the ligands; and display detailed information on the protein-ligand interactions, ligand properties and changes, protein changes, and simulation convergence for connected complexes. This information is given for the end points of the perturbation, λ = 0 and λ = 1, which correspond to the two complexes: no information is given for intermediate stages.</p>
        <h2><a name="using"></a>Using the Analysis Tab</h2>
        <p>The purpose of this tab is to analyze the results of FEP+ jobs. On the computational side, it provides tools for assessing the error in the predicted ΔΔG values by examining the hysteresis around loops and assessing the accuracy by comparison with experimental ΔG values. On the lead optimization side, the ΔΔG values provide information on the effect of a functional group substitution at a site on the binding affinity. This in turn can be used to direct the choice of compounds for synthesis or generate ideas for further compounds to test.</p>

        <h4>Error Estimates</h4>
        <p>The errors in the cycle-closure-corrected estimates of ΔΔG are calculated as follows. (Combined errors are evaluated as usual by quadratic combination.)</p>
        <p>For each pair of ligands that are directly connected (by an edge in the graph), the hysteresis is evaluated for each loop involving that edge, and the error for each loop <i>k</i> is evaluated as</p>
        <p>error<sub>k</sub> = hysteresis<sub><i>k</i></sub>/√<i>N<sub>k</sub></i></p>
        <p>where <i>N<sub>k</sub></i> is the number of nodes in the loop. The error in ΔΔG for the pair of ligands is taken as the maximum loop error.</p>
        <p>For each pair of ligands that are not directly connected, the error is evaluated for each loop that contains the two ligands, and the error in ΔΔG is taken to be that of the loop with the smallest error. The error around a loop is evaluated by using the expression above for the error in each edge of the loop.</p>
        <p>See <a href="../fep_user_manual/fep_methodology_cycle_closure.htm" class="MCXref xref" xrefformat="{paratext}">FEP Cycle Closure Method and Error Estimates</a> for a more detailed explanation.</p>
        <p>To estimate the ΔG for each ligand, some experimental binding free energies are required. The predicted binding free energy is estimated as</p>
        <p>ΔG<sub>j</sub>(pred) = (1/<i>M</i>) Σ<sub>k</sub> [ ΔG<sub>k</sub>(exp) − ΔΔG<sub>kj</sub> ]</p>
        <p>where there are <i>M</i> experimental binding free energies over which the sum is performed. The prediction is just the average of the values obtained by using each experimental value as a reference. Similarly, the predicted error is taken by combining the errors for each experimental value used and dividing by the number of experimental values:</p>
        <p>e<sub>j</sub>(pred) = (1/<i>M</i>) √ Σ<sub>k</sub> e<sub>kj</sub>(pred)<sup>2</sup></p>
        <p>where e<sub>kj</sub>(pred) is the error in the prediction of the binding free energy from the use of a single experimental value <i>k</i> as reference,
e<sub>kj</sub>(pred)<sup>2</sup> = e<sub>k</sub>(exp)<sup>2</sup> + e<sub>kj</sub>(ΔΔG)<sup>2</sup>. </p>
        <p>See <a href="../fep_user_manual/fep_methodology_deltaG.htm" class="MCXref xref" xrefformat="{paratext}">Conversion of ΔΔG Values to ΔG Values</a> for a more detailed explanation.</p>
        <p>By default the experimental error e<sub>k</sub>(exp) is taken to be 0.4 kcal/mol, and e<sub>kj</sub>(ΔΔG) is the error in the predicted relative binding free energy for ligands <i>k</i> and <i>j</i>.</p>

When you move the pointer over the plot area, a vertical line is displayed at the time position, and the time and RMSD values are displayed to the right of the line.</p>
                <p>The RMSD of a ligand is measured by first aligning the protein-ligand complex on the protein backbone of the input protein structure, and then measuring the RMSD of the ligand heavy atoms. Note that the RMSD values can fluctuate more than you typically observe in regular MD simulations:  large values merely reflect multiple conformations that can exist in the neighboring replicas.</p>

For each rotatable bond, a representative dihedral angle is monitored throughout the simulation for both complex and solvent legs. The values of the dihedral angle for all the time steps are binned and plotted as a bar chart, along with the torsional potential. The bars for the complex are colored green, while those for the ligand in solvent have a white background. The bars also have diagonal stripes going in different directions for the complex and the solvated ligand, so that you can distinguish them when they overlap.</p>
                <p> The 2D structures of the ligands are displayed at the top, with the rotatable bonds marked. When you move the pointer into the plots, the other atoms that define the dihedral angle are highlighted on the ligands. </p>

                <p>If the simulation has equilibrated, the protein RMSD should be fluctuating around some thermal average, by around 1-3 Å. If the RMSD is still increasing or decreasing, the simulation has not equilibrated, and the simulation may not be long enough for rigorous analysis.

The RMSF for the residues is the time-averaged fluctuation of the square deviation of a designated set of residue atoms over the entire simulation time, after superposition on the reference frame.
