        <p>This panel is used to interactively assign orientations of hydrogen-bonded groups in proteins (including waters) and of the imidazole ring in His and the terminal amides in Asn and Gln.</p>
        <h2><a name="using"></a>Using the Interactive H-Bond Optimizer Panel</h2>
        <p>This panel can be used from the Protein Preparation Wizard panel to check on the assigmnents of hydrogen orientations in the hydrogen-bonding network and the His, Asn, and Gln orientations. Each hydrogen bond donor, His ring, and Asn and Gln terminal amide is considered a separate orientable species.</p>
