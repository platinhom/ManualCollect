        <p>Calculate sequence identity in multiple alignment columns that are within a certain spatial distance from ligand residues, and filter the alignment sequences based on the sequence identity.</p>
        <h2><a name="using"></a>Using the Analyze Binding Sites Dialog Box</h2>
        <p>To analyze a binding site, you must have a sequence and a structure for the query, and the structure must have at least one ligand (it can have more). Next, you must have a set of sequences that are aligned to the query, which you can obtain from a BLAST search followed by an alignment. If you want to do the analysis for sequences other than the query, you must have structures with ligands for those sequences.</p>
        <p>When you open the dialog box, the query sequence is analyzed and annotated with ligand contacts (for all ligands), and the columns for the residues that are in contact with the ligand (or first ligand) are selected. Sequences that have 100% identity with the query residues that are in contact with the ligand (or the first ligand) are also selected by default.</p>
        <p>The dialog box opens at the <span class="GUI">Conservation Analysis</span> tab. If you want to select and remove sequences that are similar to the query or different from the query in the active site, you can use the tools in this tab.</p>
        <p>The <span class="GUI">Distance Analysis</span> tab is useful for examining the average conservation within a set of sequences. The analysis could be repeated for different queries to obtain a comparison of the average conservation for the queries.</p>
        <p>You can change the sequence and select the ligand with the <span class="GUI">Sequence</span> and <span class="GUI">Ligand</span> option menus. When you change the sequence, the new sequence is analyzed and annotated and the column selection updated for the new ligand. Changing the ligand updates the column selection.</p>
