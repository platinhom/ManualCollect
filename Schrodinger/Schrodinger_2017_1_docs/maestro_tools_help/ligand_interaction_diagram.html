        <p>This panel allows you to generate and display a 2D diagram of the interactions between a ligand and various protein residues.</p>
        <h2><a name="using"></a>Using the Ligand Interaction Diagram Panel</h2>
        <p>The Ligand Interaction Diagram displays interactions between a single ligand and a protein receptor. <MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="Default.not_WATERMAP"> The ligand and receptor must be included in the Workspace. If you include more than one ligand, the available ligands are listed on the <span class="GUI">Ligand</span> option menu, and you can choose which one you want to display.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
        <p>The distances and angles that determine the interactions displayed are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1"><b>Hydrogen bonds:</b> The maximum distance is 2.5 Å; the minimum donor angle is 120.0°, and the minimum acceptor angle is 90.0°. These values are consistent with the default values that are used in Maestro.
			</li>
            <li value="2"><b>Salt bridge:</b> Salt bridges are defined by oppositely-charged atoms that are within 5 Å and are not directly hydrogen-bonded.
			</li>
            <li value="3"><b>Pi-pi stacking:</b> A pi-pi interaction is defined as an interaction between two aromatic rings in which either (a) the angle between the ring planes is less than 30° and the distance between the ring centroids is less than 4.4 Å (face-to-face), or (b) the angle between the ring planes is greater than 60° and the distance between the ring centroids is less than 5.5 Å (edge-to-face). 
			</li>
            <li value="4"><b>Pi-cation interaction:</b> The maximum distance between the cation center and the ring center is 6.6 Å; and the angle between the ring plane and the line between the cation center and the ring center is greater than 60°.
			</li>
            <li value="5"><b>Metal-coordination:</b> The maximum distance between the metal and the ligating atom is 2.5 Å.

        <h3><a name="feature3"></a>Display Area</h3>
        <p>This area displays the diagram. The color scheme and symbols used for the residues, ligand, and interactions is shown in the legend, which you can display with <span class="GUI">View → LID Legend</span>.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>The ligand is displayed as a 2D structure. Residues are represented as colored teardrop shapes, labeled with the residue name and residue number, and colored according to their properties. The point on the teardrop shape is oriented in the direction of the side chain. The chain is represented as a black line connecting residues. Residues on this line that are not within the threshold distance are represented as black dots.</p>
        <p>Interactions between the residues and the ligand are drawn as lines, colored by interaction type. Residues that are present but don't have a line drawn for an interaction are involved in nonspecific hydrophobic interactions with the ligand. The binding pocket is indicated by a line drawn around the ligand, colored by the color of the nearest residue. Solvent exposure is indicated on the ligand atoms, and by the break in the line drawn around the pocket.</p>
