        <h1 class="Title">Defining the Core for R-Group Analysis</h1>
        <p>The second step in the analysis is to choose a method for the definition of the core of the structures. The analysis determines the R groups that are attached to this core. The core can be taken from CombiGlide attachment-bond labeling, specified by a SMARTS pattern, or determined by the maximum common substructure obtained from a Canvas MCS run. The options available under <span class="GUI">Core definition from</span> are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p class="ListPara"><span class="GUI">Canvas maximum common substructure</span>—Use the maximum common substructure as determined from a Canvas MCS calculation. When you choose this option, you must also choose a definition of equivalent atoms from the <span class="GUI">Atom equivalences</span> option menu. The options are described in <a class="TopicLink MCXref xref xrefTopicLink" href="../canvas_command_reference/canvas_command_canvasFPGen.htm#canvas_command_2298859567_62693" xrefformat="{paratext}">canvasFPGen</a> and also in the help message for <code>canvasMCS</code>, which you can view with the following command:</p>
                <p class="Code1">$SCHRODINGER/utilities/canvasMCS -h</p>
                <p class="ListPara">You can also select <span class="GUI">Do not allow partial rings in the core</span> to ensure that the rings in the core are always complete, and are not broken when finding the substructure for the core. </p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p class="ListPara"><span class="GUI">SMARTS</span>—Specify a SMARTS pattern for the core in the text box. From Maestro, you can also select atoms in the Workspace and click <span class="GUI">Get from Workspace Selection</span> to load a SMARTS pattern into the text box. You can edit the SMARTS pattern in the text box. </p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p class="ListPara"><span class="GUI">CombiGlide annotation in structures</span>—Use the core definition that has been added by CombiGlide. You should use this option only if you are using structures that were generated by CombiGlide.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The CombiGlide annotation for determining the core provides a unique definition, and one that is restricted to singly bonded terminal attachments. The use of SMILES or Canvas MCS to determine the core can result in cores with different atomic composition, multiply bonded R groups, R groups that are attached to the core in more than one location, and multiple core structures. </p>
        <p>When Canvas MCS methods that allow different atom or bond types to be treated as equivalent are used, some cores may have attachment points to which no R group is attached. For example, the core might contain a pyridine ring in one structure, but a benzene ring in another. An attachment point in the benzene ring might be at the carbon atom corresponding to the nitrogen in the pyridine. In this case, the attachment at the nitrogen is considered a “null” attachment, and a dummy atom is used with the label “Null”. </p>
        <p>R groups that are attached with multiple bonds are treated as any other group. You might, for example have a carbonyl group (XC=OX') in one structure where there is a substituted methylene group (e.g. XCHCH<sub>3</sub>X') in another. In the first structure the R group is =O, in the second it is –CH<sub>3</sub>. The core in both structures involves the X-C-X' framework.</p>
        <p>R groups that are attached at multiple attachment points (thus forming rings) are listed as groups for each attachment point. </p>
        <p>When using these two methods, the program must decide which mapping to use for each input structure if the core substructure maps to some input structures in several ways. The program picks the best set of mappings chiefly by optimizing the fingerprint similarity of the side chains for pairwise alignments of the input structures. This choice usually also minimizes the number of R-group positions defined on the core.</p>
