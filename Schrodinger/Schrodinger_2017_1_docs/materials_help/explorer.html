        <p>This panel uses a self-organizing map to cluster <span class="Snippetmol_type" data-mc-variable-override="Snippet.mol_type:structure,">structure</span>s by sets of properties, and allows you to explore the properties of the <span class="Snippetmol_type" data-mc-variable-override="Snippet.mol_type:structure,">structure</span>s based on this clustering.</p>
        <p>A Canvas license is required (to create the self-organizing map).</p><a name="using"></a>
        <h2>Using the <span class="Snippetpanel_title" data-mc-variable-override="Snippet.panel_title:Materials Explorer,">Materials Explorer</span> Panel</h2>
        <p>The project entries are clustered with self-organizing maps, using some set of descriptors, such as Glide properties, fingerprints, or other molecular properties.  These clusters define groups of molecules that are similar based on the descriptors used. The number of clusters is determined by the size chosen for the map.  A 3x3 map, for instance divides the entries into 9 clusters arranged in a 3 by 3 square matrix. You can calculate maps for the same set of descriptors with different sizes.</p>
        <p>Once you have calculated a map, any property can be "projected" onto the map. To do this, you pick a property, such as the Glide Docking score, and a statistic of this property, such as the mean, maximum, or minimum. This statistic is calculated for the chosen property for each cluster in the map.  These values are then displayed as a color mapping on the map.  You can then explore the clusters and the property, such as which entries are in each cell, what the property values are for each cell, what the distance between cells is, and which descriptors are most important to separating the clusters.</p>
        <p>Each cell in a property map represents a set of molecules that were grouped together in the self-organizing map.  Neighboring cells are closer to each other in property space. Gray cells with an orange X are empty. The color of the cell indicates the value of the property that was mapped onto that cell.</p>
        <p>Clicking on a cell in a property map highlights that cell and shows where the members of the cell are distributed in all the maps. By default, the size of the red circle indicates the percentage of the cell's members that are in the highlighted cell.  The indicator of percentage can be changed using the <span class="GUI">Membership indicators</span> option menu.  A tooltip on the menu describes how each type of membership indicator behaves.</p>
        <p>You can select multiple cells, using control-click. When you have multiple cells selected, the markers can represent the combined set of <span class="Snippetmol_type" data-mc-variable-override="Snippet.mol_type:structure,">structure</span>s (union, logical OR), the common set of <span class="Snippetmol_type" data-mc-variable-override="Snippet.mol_type:structure,">structure</span>s (intersection, logical AND), or the <span class="Snippetmol_type" data-mc-variable-override="Snippet.mol_type:structure,">structure</span>s that are different (only in the first cell selected). You can choose which is represented from the <span class="GUI">Multiple cell highlight mode</span> option menu.</p>
        <p>When you select cells, you can apply various actions to the <span class="Snippetmol_type" data-mc-variable-override="Snippet.mol_type:structure,">structure</span>s in the selected cells: select them in the Project Table, include them in the Workspace, or mark them as viewed. You can also separately mark individual <span class="Snippetmol_type" data-mc-variable-override="Snippet.mol_type:structure,">structure</span>s.</p><a name="features"></a>
