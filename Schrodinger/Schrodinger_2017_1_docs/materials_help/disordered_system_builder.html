        <h1 class="title">Disordered System Builder Panel</h1><a name="summary"></a>
        <p>Build a randomized multi-component organic mixture of a given composition, either on its own, or on a substrate. The substrate can be a crystal surface, the exterior of a nanoparticle, or the interior of a "container" such as a nanotube. The resulting structure can be prepared for molecular dynamics simulations.</p>
        <p class="opening">To open this panel, choose <span class="GUI">Tasks → Materials → Build  → Disordered System</span> in the Task Tool.</p>
        <h2><a name="using"></a>Using the Disordered System Builder Panel</h2>
        <p>This panel allows you to create a disordered system from a single compound or a mixture of organic compounds of a given composition, either on its own, or on a substrate. The system that is constructed can be prepared for Desmond molecular dynamics simulations. If you are preparing a system for coarse-grained modeling, the molecules can also be coarse-grained particles.</p>
        <p>The basic input is a set of molecules, which can be a set of entries in the Project Table or in a single file that contains only the desired molecules. You choose the proportions of each molecule in the mixture, and the total number of molecules to place in the simulation box. If you want a pure substance rather than a mixture, you can simply choose a single molecule as input. However, you can also choose to build homogeneous cells of each component, in addition to the mixture, in the <span class="GUI">Cells</span> section.</p>
        <p>The proportions or percentages that you specify must be regarded as a target value, as there must be an integer number of molecules in the disordered system. The larger the number of molecules in the box, the closer the actual proportions will be to the target values. Of course, the resources for the simulation also increase with the number of atoms in the simulation, and also resources for display of results in Maestro. For guidance, Maestro can display up to about 500,000 atoms comfortably on a machine with 4GB memory, and a Desmond simulation with about 100,000 atoms run on 8 cores would take about 1 day per ns of simulation. If you are preparing a simulation box, you should in any case ensure that the box is not too small - each side must be at least 20&#160;Å, which means a minimum of around 3000 atoms.</p>
        <p>The cell containing the mixture can be replicated with different random distributions and orientations of the components (but in the same proportions), so that you can check the variation with initial conditions, or accumulate statistics for the system. You can also create cells for each of the pure compounds, and have multiple randomly distributed replicas of these as well.</p>
        <p>There are several choices for how the molecules are placed in the box, which are given in the <span class="GUI">Disorder</span> section. An initial placement is made, which can be followed by up to three stages of modification that can relax the system, pack the system more densely, or minimize its energy.</p>
        <p>If you choose <span class="GUI">Snap to grid</span>, the molecules are chosen at random and placed on a cubic grid, optionally with random orientation. The box is filled up in order of increasing values of <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, then <i>z</i>. If the number of molecules is not a perfect cube, there is space remaining at the top of the box, and the box side parameters are adjusted afterwards. To ensure that the box does not have empty space that the MD simulations must fill, you should choose the number of molecules so that only one or two full layers of molecules are missing from the cube (that is, <i>n</i><sup>3</sup>−<i>n</i><sup>2</sup> or <i>n</i><sup>3</sup>−2<i>n</i><sup>2</sup>).</p>
        <p>If you choose <span class="GUI">Amorphous</span> for the initial placement, the molecules are chosen randomly, placed randomly, and oriented randomly, inside the box. If after a specified number of attempts (set in the <span class="GUI">Disorder Options</span> dialog box) to create a system without clashes, the density or the van der Waals radii are decreased in order to find a system without clashes.You can request that the density is maximized after finding a system without clashes.</p>
        <p>After the initial placement, you can perform any of the three post-placement processes.</p>
        <p>The first, <span class="GUI">Monte Carlo simulated annealing</span>, allows you to translate and rotate the molecules at random at a set of decreasing temperatures, using either a chosen force field, or an energy term that is linear in the minimum distance between any atom in the molecule and any atom in the substrate (or the center of the box, if there is no substrate), or both. The linear term encourages molecules to move towards the substrate (or center). The force field encourages molecules to move to more energetically favorable locations, while ensuring that clashes do not occur. (If you don't use the force field, clashes are avoided with a hard-sphere model.)</p>
        <p>The second, <span class="GUI">Steric pack</span>, attempts to maximize the density of the system by moving molecules towards the substrate or the center of the box (if there is no substrate). Packing is done by moving each molecule towards the substrate or the origin in a straight line, and the molecule is placed in the nearest cavity to the substrate or the origin that has no steric clashes. The process starts with the molecules that are closest to the substrate or origin and moves outwards.</p>
        <p>The third, <span class="GUI">Minimization</span>, attempts to minimize the energy of the system using a chosen force field.</p>
        <p>After these processes have been carried out, the box is refit to the final system, to minimize the empty space.</p>
        <p>If you select the option to prepare Desmond systems, the output consists of one or more CMS (<code>.cms</code>) files, which you can use directly in Desmond MD simulations. The file containing the model system for the mixture is named <i>jobname</i><code>.cms</code>, so you should choose a descriptive job name (rather than the default). The files containing the model systems for the components are named <i>jobname</i><code>-component</code><i>n</i><code>.cms</code>, where <i>n</i> is the component number in the <span class="GUI">Components</span> table. If you chose to generate multiple cells of each type, a suffix <code>_</code><i>N</i> is added, where <i>N</i> indexes the replicas of each type.</p>
        <p>If you chose not to prepare Desmond systems, the output consists of Maestro files that contain the periodic boundary condition properties, and are named in the same way as the Desmond systems except with the suffix <code>.maegz</code>.</p>
        <p>If you are using this panel to build a system for coarse-grained modeling, some of the choices described above do not apply. See <a href="../materials_user_manual/coarse_grain_disordered_system.htm" class="MCXref xref" xrefformat="{paratext}">Constructing Disordered Systems for Coarse-Grained Modeling</a> for more information.</p>

To ensure that the simulation box does not have any spaces, you should choose a number that is a perfect cube, or a number that results in only one or two layers of molecules missing from the cube (that is, <i>n</i><sup>3</sup>−<i>n</i><sup>2</sup> or <i>n</i><sup>3</sup>−2<i>n</i><sup>2</sup>).

            </dd>
            <h3><a name="components"></a>Components section</h3>
            <p>The table in this section lists the components that you selected for inclusion in the simulation box. It is updated whenever you choose a structure source. The percentages are initially set to be equal. You can edit the table cells to change the composition. As you edit the cells, the values in the unedited cells are adjusted so that the values add up to 100. Once you have edited all cells, you can change any of the values, but the other values are no longer adjusted.</p>
            <p>The percentages are used to determine the number of molecules of each type, by multiplying them by the total number of molecules, and dividing by 100, then rounding up to the nearest integer. The percentages or proportions you provide will therefore not be exact, and must be regarded as a target value. However, you must ensure that the number of molecules for each component, which is reported in the <span class="GUI">Molecules</span> column, adds up to the total. If it does not, you must adjust either the percentages or the number of molecules, by editing either the percentage column or the <span class="GUI">Molecules</span> column.</p>
            <p>For example, if you have an odd number of molecules in a two-component mixture, the default percentages are both 50, and the number of molecules does not add up to the total, as both are rounded up. You must change one of the components to have one more molecule than the other.</p>
            <h3><a name="substrate"></a>Substrate option and section</h3>

            <p>These options allow you to choose from two periodic boundary conditions or use the periodic boundary conditions that are imported with the substrate.</p>
            <ul>
                <li value="1">
                    <p><span class="GUI">Create new orthorhombic periodic boundary condition</span>—Create a new orthorhombic periodic boundary condition that encompasses the entire system. If a substrate is present, the base of the box is chosen to include the entire substrate surface. If the substrate surface is not rectangular, it will not cover the entire width and breadth of the box.</p>
                </li>
                <li value="2">
                    <p><span class="GUI">Create new cubic periodic boundary condition</span>—Create a new cubic periodic boundary condition that encompasses the entire system. If a substrate is present, the base of the box is chosen to include the entire substrate surface. If the substrate surface is not square, it will not cover the entire width and breadth of the box.</p>
                </li>
                <li value="3">
                    <p><span class="GUI">Use substrate periodic boundary condition</span>—Use the periodic boundary condition that already exists on the substrate. The crystal vector that you chose for the periodic boundary condition is expanded to include the disordered system. If the crystal vector is not perpendicular to the surface, the disordered system will be built at an angle, occupying the volume created by the extension. This option is only available if <span class="GUI">Substrate</span> is selected.</p>

                <dd>
                    <p>Specify the number of replicas of each type of cell (disordered, pure component) to create. Each replica for a cell type is created with the same composition but different random distribution of the components and orientations, generated with the random number seed in the <span class="GUI">Disorder Options</span> dialog box. The resulting cells are written to separate files with an index to identify the replicas. Having multiple cells with the same composition but different random placement of the components can be useful for checking the dependence of the results on the initial conditions, or for accumulating statistics about the system.</p>
