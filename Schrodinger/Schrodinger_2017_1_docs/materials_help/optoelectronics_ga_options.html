        <h3><a name="feature4"></a>Individual selection section</h3>
        <p>In this section, you specify how individuals are selected as parents for the next generation. The selection may be based on the scoring function for the "fitness" of the individuals.</p>
        <dl>
            <dt><a name="feature4.1"></a><span class="GUI">Always use the top N scoring individuals without modification in the next generation</span>
            </dt>
            <dd>
                <p>Specify the number of individuals to carry forward to the next generation without modification. The individuals with the highest scores are selected (elitism). Set the value to 0 to turn off this feature.</p>

            </dt>
            <dd>
                <p>Choose a method for selecting the individuals that are used as the parents for the next generation. The selection is done to fill the places in the population after the highest-scoring individuals are selected (if any). The choices are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li value="1"><span class="GUI">Rank</span>—Select individuals at random, with the probablility of selection proportional to the rank of the individual. The rank is the index of the individual in a list sorted by increasing score: the highest scoring individual has the highest index and thus the highest rank. (This is a roulette wheel method in which the pocket size is the rank.)</li>
                    <li value="2"><span class="GUI">Roulette wheel</span>—Select individuals at random, with the probability of selection (pocket size) proportional to the score.</li>

                    <li value="4"><span class="GUI">Tournament with roulette</span>—Select the highest-scoring individual from a randomly selected pool of the size specified in the <span class="GUI">Tournament size</span> box. The selection of members of the pool is done by roulette-wheel random sampling, where the probability of selection is proportional to the score.</li>
                    <li value="5"><span class="GUI">Uniform</span>—Select individuals by uniform random selections. In this method, all individuals have the same probability of selection: there is no bias toward the fitter individuals.</li>

            </dt>
            <dd>
                <p>Choose the protocol for scaling scores to differentiate between individuals towards the end of the optimization, where scores may not be well separated. The protocols are standard genetic algorithm protocols, information on which can be found in textbooks or online.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt><a name="feature4.5"></a><span class="GUI">Penalize</span>
            </dt>
            <dd>
                <p>Select options for penalizing certain kinds of structures. A structure score is evaluated for the structure, as described below. If the structure score is below this threshold, its optoelectronic properties are not calculated and its survival score is lowered so that it is less likely to be selected for the next generation.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li value="1"><span class="GUI">Atypical structures</span>—Penalize structures that are atypical for optoelectronics. The structure score is based on the number of atoms (&lt; 200), the molecular weight (&lt; 1100), the number of different elements (&lt; 5), the presence of three-atom or longer chains consisting of N, O, P, or S, and the presence of two or more different halogens, with weights for each of these components in the score.</li>
                    <li value="2"><span class="GUI">H<sub>2</sub></span>—If a genetic operation produces the hydrogen molecule, its structure score is set to -100.</li>

            </dt>
            <dd>
                <p>Set the threshold on the structure score for determining when a structure is considered to be "bad". This score is used when introducing new structures to replace bad structures, and for determining whether to evaluate optoelectronic properties when structure-based properties are in use (either for optimization or for penalties). If you want to perform optoelectronics calculations on all structures then set this threshold to a large negative number and none will be replaced nor skipped. If you want to replace or skip a larger number of the lowest structure-scoring individuals then set this threshold to a larger positive number.</p>

            <dd>
                <p>When a genetic operation produces undesirable structures, or no structures, they can be replaced by structures from a pool, which is defined by the options selected for <span class="GUI">Draw structures from</span>. There are two classes of undesirable structures:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li value="1"><span class="GUI">Non-unique children</span>—Child structures from a crossover mutation that are the same as each other or the same as their parents. If the crossover produces the same results as the two parents, both children are replaced; if the children are identical to each other, one of the children is replaced. This option also replaces parents from the pool if they produce no structures.</li>
                    <li value="2"><span class="GUI">Bad structures</span>—Structures whose structure score is below the threshold given in the <span class="GUI">Bad structure score threshold</span> text box. It is replaced by a structure from the pool that has a better structure score. This option is only relevant if you are including structure-based properties for scoring or you are penalizing structures with the <span class="GUI">Penalize</span> options.</li>
                </ul>
            </dd>

            </dt>
            <dd>
                <p>Specify the source of structures to draw from when replacing undesirable structures. When selecting a structure, the source is selected at random, then from the source a structure is selected at random. The available sources are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li value="1"><span class="GUI">Remaining input structures</span>—Draw structures from the set of input structures that were not selected for the initial population.</li>
                    <li value="2"><span class="GUI">Previous generations</span>—Draw structures from the set of structures from all previous generations.</li>
                    <li value="3"><span class="GUI">Fragments</span>—Draw structures from the fragment libraries (see <a href="#fraglib">Choose Fragment Libraries</a>).</li>
                </ul>
            </dd>
        </dl>
        <h3><a name="feature6"></a>Property-based termination section</h3>
        <p>In this section, you can choose the for terminating the optimization based on whether properties hit the target.</p>
        <dl>
            <dt><a name="feature6.1"></a><span class="GUI">One property hits target</span>
            </dt>
            <dd>
                <p>Stop the optimization if the target for one of the properties is attained (greater than, equal to, or less than the target value). Only available if at least one property has a target value.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt><a name="feature6.2"></a><span class="GUI">All properties hit targets</span>
            </dt>
            <dd>
                <p>Stop the optimization if the targets for all of the properties are attained (greater than, equal to, or less than the target value). Only available if more than one property has a target value.</p>
            </dd>
        </dl>
        <h3><a name="seed"></a>Use random seed</h3>
        <p>Select this option to specify the random seed to use for all random operations, and specify the seed in the box. This option allows you to reproduce the results of an optimization with the same input structures.</p>
        <h3><a name="fraglib"></a>Choose Fragment Libraries</h3>
        <p>Click this button to choose the fragment libraries to use in fragment mutation. The available standard libraries include some of the fragment libraries available in the <span class="GUI">Build</span> panel, the CombiGlide default library, and an optoelectronics library. You can also specify your own set of fragments by selecting <span class="GUI">Custom</span> and opening a file that contains the structures. All hydrogen atoms on these structures are considered as candidates for removal to form a bond to the individual that is being mutated, and one of these is chosen at random.</p>
        <h3><a name="csearch"></a>Load Custom Conformational Search Options</h3>
        <p>Use a MacroModel simplified input file to customize the conformational search. Clicking this button opens a file selector in which you can navigate to and select the file. The default MacroModel conformational search options are used otherwise. The file name is reported to the right of the button. If you no longer want to use this file, click the X button to the right of the file name.</p>
