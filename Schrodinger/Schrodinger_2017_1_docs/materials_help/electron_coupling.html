        <h1 class="title">Electron Coupling Panel</h1><a name="summary"></a>
        <p>Compute the charge transfer rate between molecules in a structure that consists of multiple molecules (monomers). The structure could be generated from a molecular dynamics simulation with Desmond, for example. Marcus theory is used for the hopping rate, based on DFT calculations for the electron transfer between donors and acceptors with either full wave function or dimer frontier orbital splitting calculations of the coupling matrix element.</p>
        <p class="opening">To open this panel, choose <span class="GUI">Tasks → Quantum Mechanics → Optoelectronics → Electron Coupling</span> in the Task Tool.</p>
        <h2><a name="using"></a>Using the Electron Coupling Panel</h2>
        <p>This panel can be used to calculate carrier hopping rates in an amorphous structure. It is mainly designed for the results of an MD simulation with a homogeneous system, but it can be used for any structure consisting of multiple molecules. To set up the structure with MD, you can use the <a href="disordered_system_builder.html"><span class="GUI">Disordered System Builder</span> panel</a> and then run a simulation with the <a href="../desmond_help/molecular_dynamics_panel.html"><span class="GUI">Molecular Dynamics</span> panel</a>. You can also import structures from other sources into Maestro. The structures must consist of multiple molecules.</p>
        <p>As well as supplying the structures, you must also supply the reorganization energy. You can calculate the reorganization energy with the <a href="optoelectronics_calculations.html">Optoelectronics Calculations</a> panel. The reorganization energy is assumed to have been calculated for the isolated, ground state relaxed molecule, and is assumed to be independent of the geometry in the mixture. If you have a heterogeneous system, you must decide how to treat the reorganization energy, which is specified here as a single value and thus cannot be given for different components.</p>
        <p>The matrix elements for the hopping are calculated using QM wave functions based on DFT calculations. The two alternatives are to run calculations on the donor and acceptor in a pair independently, with the charge localized on one or the other of the two, or to run calculations on the dimer and constrain the charge to lie on either the donor or acceptor. The former is done with normal DFT methods; the latter is done with constrained DFT (CDFT). All calculations are run as single-point Jaguar calculations at the geometry of the input structure.</p>
        <p>There is a chance that a QM calculation can result in an excited state rather than the ground state. CDFT calculations appear to be particularly susceptible to this issue. Therefore, it is always important to check the HOMO and LUMO values listed in the Project Table for the initial and final states to verify that the HOMO energy is lower than the LUMO energy. If these values are reversed, the calculation should be repeated, adding the setting <code>vshift=0.0</code> in the <span class="GUI">Keywords</span> text box. By default, the value is 0.2 for hybrid DFT functionals and 0.3 for pure DFT.</p>
        <p>When the job is run, each Jaguar job is run sequentially, but you can run individual Jaguar jobs in parallel. Doing this is useful if the molecule or the basis set is large. You cannot run CDFT (dimer) jobs in parallel, but you can run dimer splitting jobs or DFT (monomer) jobs in parallel. If the job ends prematurely due to problems like network or hardware issues, you can restart it with the <a href="restart_workflow.html"><span class="GUI">Restart Workflow</span> panel</a>.</p>
        <p>The results of the calculation depend on the coupling method chosen. For each dimer, a set of structures is produced. For the dimer frontier orbital splitting method, the structural output consists of a dimer structure, and includes properties for the hopping rate and the coupling matrix element (in eV), as well as the Jaguar properties for the neutral dimer. For the full wave function treatment, the output includes two dimer structures in addition to the DFT or CDFT structures. The dimer structures have the rate properties, one for the forward rate and one for the reverse rate. The properties are the charge transfer coupling (T_i-&gt;f in the Jaguar output) and the hopping rate. If you choose to calculate both hole and electron rates, there is one set of structures for each carrier type.</p>
        <p>The hopping rate is defined by</p>
        <p>K = (2π/ℏ) e<sup>−L/(4kT)</sup> (H<sub>ab</sub>)<sup>2</sup>/√(4πLkT)</p>
        <p>where L is the reorganization energy, H<sub>ab</sub> is the electron transfer coupling matrix element, k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature, and all energies are given in joules. The rate is in units of s<sup>−1</sup>.</p>
