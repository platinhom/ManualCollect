        <p>Calculate the change in energy for dissociating molecules into combinations of two fragments that come from breaking covalent non-ring single bonds (homolytic dissociation) or removing ligands from a metal atom. All possible fragments or a restricted set of fragments can be selected for calculation.</p>
        <p class="opening">To open this panel, choose <span class="GUI">Tasks → Quantum Mechanics → Bond and Ligand Dissociation</span> in the Task Tool.</p>
        <h2><a name="using"></a>Using the Bond and Ligand Dissociation Panel</h2>
        <p>When specifying the bonds to break, you can apply restrictions on top of the choice of a single acyclic bond. You can include bonds to hydrogen along with other atoms, you can restrict the choice to break only bonds to hydrogen, or you can exclude bonds to hydrogen. As well as restricting bonds to hydrogen, there is a more general feature for either including or excluding bonds based on whether any atom in the bond is in a match to a set of SMARTS patterns.</p>
        <p>The calculations are run with Jaguar, and the geometry of each reactant and product is optimized. To maximize efficiency, a unique set of fragments for the entire input is assembled, and calculations are performed on the unique fragments.</p>
        <p>The results of the bond dissociation calculation are returned as a set of entries for each reaction, which contain the reactant and product structures for that reaction, and a set of individual reactant and product structures.</p>
        <p>In the entries for each reaction, the reaction energy is added as a property, the broken bond is marked on the reactant structure, and the atoms on each end of the broken bond are marked on the product structures. The reactant structure is placed with the broken bond on the <i>x</i> axis, on the negative end. The product structures are placed on the positive side of the <i>x</i> axis, and displaced in the <i>y</i> direction so they don't overlap. They have the same orientation as in the reactant structure. For polydentate ligands, each atom that ligates the metal is marked, and each metal-ligand bond is marked in the reactant; the average of the vectors for the broken bonds is aligned on the <i>x</i> axis in this case.</p>
        <p>In the individual structures, the reaction products are titled "fragment # X", where # is the index of the fragment and X gives information about the state. The job name is also appended to the title, so that you can distinguish the results of different runs.</p>
        <p>If a job fails due to problems like network or hardware issues, you can restart the job with the <a href="restart_workflow.html"><span class="GUI">Restart Workflow</span> panel</a>.</p>
