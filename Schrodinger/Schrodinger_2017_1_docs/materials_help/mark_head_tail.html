        <p>Mark the head and tail atoms of a monomer unit so that they can be identified in subsequent applications, such as for use in Canvas QSAR modeling.</p>
        <p class="opening">To open this panel, choose <span class="GUI">Tasks → Materials → Mark Monomer Head and Tail</span> in the Task Tool.</p>
        <h2><a name="using"></a>Using the Mark Monomer Head and Tail Panel</h2>
        <p>The monomer structure that you use to mark must have a hydrogen atom attached to the head atom and to the tail atom that represents the rest of the polymer. Put another way, you could consider making the required monomer structure from the polymer by deleting the rest of the polymer and capping the dangling bonds of the monomer with hydrogens. This might not be the same as the monomer used in the actual polymerization reaction: for example, if you were polymerizing 4-hydroxy benzoic acid by esterification, the monomer unit would be represented by benzoic acid, with the hydrogen of the carboxylic acid and the 4-hydrogen of the ring as the capping groups, and the OH oxygen and the 4-carbon as the head and tail.</p>
        <p>You can mark the head and tail atoms in multiple related monomer structures by selecting them in the Project Table and choosing <span class="GUI">The same atom indexes in all selected entries</span> from the <span class="GUI">Apply to</span> option menu. These structures must have a common atom numbering for the part that includes the head and tail atoms—this is usually the case when you enumerate a side chain on the base monomer to generate variations.</p>

One of these structures must be included in the Workspace so that you can pick the head and tail atoms. The other structures must have the same atom numbering for the part of the structure that is common to the structure in the Workspace. This will be the case, for example, if you build the monomers by changing a substituent attached to the backbone part of the monomer.</p>

            <dd>
                <p>Select this option to pick the head and tail atoms in the Workspace. You must pick the head atom first, then the tail atom. The head and tail atoms must have a hydrogen attached where the monomer is joined to the next unit in the polymer. So for example, if the polymerization reaction is an esterification, you must have a H atom in place of the OH group of the carboxylic acid in the monomer unit.</p>
