        <h1 class="title">Reaction Channel Enumeration Panel</h1><a name="summary"></a>
        <p>For a given set of reactants, enumerate possible reaction channels for several kinds of reactions, either by choosing specific channels, by random selection, or by exhaustive enumeration.</p>
        <p class="opening">To open this panel, choose <span class="GUI">Tasks → Materials → Enumerate →  Reaction Channel</span> in the Task Tool.</p>
        <h2><a name="using"></a>Using the Reaction Channel Enumeration Panel</h2>
        <p>This panel can be used to enumerate the products for various reaction channels, given a set of reactants. The reactant and product structures can then be used as input for reaction path interpolation or a transition state search.</p>
        <p>The structures are written to a file, with all the reactant molecules in the first entry, followed by entries containing the products. The products for each channel are placed consecutively in the file. If you chose to create one entry per product, the product molecules for a given product set for a given channel are placed consecutively in the file. The file is incorporated into the project by default.</p>
        <p>You can enumerate reaction channels for multiple molecules by including them all in the Workspace, then setting up the enumerations. As each reaction involves only one or two reactants, the other molecules are spectators, and are included in the output reactant and product structures. Before using these structures for other calculations, you should remove the spectators.</p>
