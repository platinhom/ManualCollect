        <p>The <span class="GUI">Protein Preparation - Problems</span> dialog box lists the atoms and residues for which atoms are missing (often the side chains), atom types are misassigned, atoms are overlapping, or atoms have alternate positions. It opens automatically at the end of preprocessing if any of these problems are detected. You can open this dialog box at any time by clicking <span class="GUI">View Problems</span>.</p>
        <p>You can click on any row in the tables of this dialog box to select the atom or residue listed in that row in the Workspace and zoom in on it. This makes it easy to inspect the structure and fix it. You can perform any Maestro operation while this dialog box is open. After fixing the structure, click <span class="GUI">Update</span> to reanalyze the Workspace and display an updated list of problems. </p>

        <p class="figure" data-mc-autonum="Figure 1:"><span class="autonumber"><span>Figure 1:</span></span>The Protein Preparation - Problems dialog box.</p>
        <p class="Task_LeadIn">To fix mistyped atoms:</p>
        <p>Use the tools in the <span class="GUI">3D Builder</span> panel. See <a href="manual_pprep_bonds_atoms_charges_correction.htm" class="MCXref xref">Atom and Bond Correction Tasks</a> for more information.</p>
        <p class="Task_LeadIn">To add missing side-chain atoms: </p>
        <p>If you did not select <span class="GUI">Fill in missing side chains using Prime </span>when preprocessing, you can run a Prime side-chain prediction. The residues with missing side chain atoms are colored red when you import the protein structure into Maestro. Clicking the <span class="GUI">Add Missing Side Chains</span> button automatically starts a Prime job with all the residues in the table. The panel is unavailable until the job finishes. If you want to run this job independently, or for selected residues, you can use the procedures in <a href="manual_prep_fixing_residues.htm" class="MCXref xref">Fixing Incomplete Residues</a>. </p>
        <p>You can continue the preparation process with the fixed structure. You might want to delete unwanted groups, as outlined in the next section, before running the Prime side-chain prediction. If you do, you can open the <span class="GUI">Problems</span> dialog box again to run the job.</p>
        <p class="Task_LeadIn">If the structure has overlapping atoms: </p>
        <p>You might want to inspect these regions. Ensure that you have all hydrogens displayed first. If the structure is not tangled, the restrained minimization in the <span class="GUI">Refine</span> tab should move these atoms away from each other. You can perform a manual minimization by selecting a table row and pressing <span class="Keys">Ctrl+M</span>&#160;(<span class="Keys">⌘M</span>)
 with the pointer in the Workspace. </p>
        <p>If there are duplicate het groups, minimization will not fix the problem. In this case, the atoms are on top of each other, which makes it impossible to find by visual inspection. The problem report alerts you to the existence of the duplicate. You can delete one copy of the het group in the <span class="GUI">Review and Modify</span> tab, once you have closed the <span class="GUI">Problems</span> dialog box.</p>
        <p class="Task_LeadIn">If the protein has missing residues: </p>
        <p>For residues that are critical to the intended use of the protein structure, you might need to run a Prime structure prediction to fill in the missing residues. </p>
        <p>If you did not select <span class="GUI">Fill in missing loops using Prime</span>, you can use homology modeling to fill in the loops. You should read the query or input sequence from the PDB file (not the Workspace), and use the PDB file as the template, then run the model. See <a href="manual_prep_missing_residues.htm" class="MCXref xref">Adding Missing Residues to a Protein</a> for more information.</p>
        <p>If you selected <span class="GUI">Fill in missing loops using Prime</span>, you should still refine these loops because they are not optimized. The refinement can be run from the Prime <span class="GUI">Refine Loops </span>panel (<span class="GUI">Tasks → Protein Preparation and Refinement → Refine Loops</span>), and can take some time, depending on the length of the missing section. </p>
        <p>If the missing residues are not critical, it is probably sufficient to cap them, or use the inexpensive loop prediction that is run when you select <span class="GUI">Fill in missing loops using Prime</span>.</p>
        <p class="Task_LeadIn">If the input structure has alternate positions: </p>
        <p>The residues involved are listed in the <span class="GUI">Alternate Positions</span> tab. These positions are legitimate for some applications, like PrimeX, but for most others, a single set of positions is required. This tab allows you to choose one of the alternate positions for each residue.</p>
        <p>To choose a position for a residue, first select the residue in the table. The view zooms in to the residue, and the default position is marked. Click <span class="GUI">Next Position</span> to switch between positions. The alternate position is displayed. When the position that you want to keep is displayed, click <span class="GUI">Commit</span>. The atoms in this position are kept, and the alternate atoms are deleted. </p>
        <p>If you keep alternate positions, the rest of the protein preparation is done only for the main positions. To prepare a protein for different alternate positions, you should set up and refine a copy of that protein for each set of alternate positions.</p>
