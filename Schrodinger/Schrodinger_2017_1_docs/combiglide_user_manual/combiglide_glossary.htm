        <p><b>Attachment</b>—Combination of an attachment position and a reagent file.</p>
        <p><b>Attachment position</b>—Position on a core to which side chains are attached (synonymous with ‘site of diversity’).</p>
        <p><b>Chemical feature</b>—One of six standard types of functional group: hydrogen bond acceptor (A), hydrogen bond donor (D), hydrophobe (H), negatively charged center (N), positively charged center (P), or aromatic (R). The CombiGlide definition of these feature types differs somewhat from that of standard pharmacophore analysis. </p>
        <p><b>Combinatorial library</b>—A set of compounds prepared by combinatorial synthesis.</p>
        <p><b>Combinatorial synthesis</b>—The synthesis of sets of compounds utilizing the same reaction sequence where all possible combinations of the reagents are used.</p>
        <p><b>Compound</b>—In CombiGlide, a compound is explicitly defined by a combination of reagents that are attached to a core to form a product. A compound may encompass several structures. If a reagent exists in more than one form (different tautomers, conformers, stereoisomers, protonation state), the compound may also encompass more than one variant.</p>
        <p><b>Core</b>—The structural element of a combinatorial library that is constant throughout the library. It is the part of the core-containing molecule that remains when the side chains are removed.</p>
        <p><b>Enumerate</b>—To generate structures of all possible members of a combinatorial library.</p>
        <p><b>Library selection</b>—The results of filtering and selection that generates a list of reagents at each position for a focused library, including information on the filtering and selection strategy.</p>
        <p><b>Fully substituted core</b>—A core with side chains attached at all attachment positions.</p>
        <p><b>Library definition</b>—A collection of the core-containing structure and the reagent files that defines a combinatorial library. Can be used as input to library enumeration or combinatorial screening. </p>
        <p><b>Minimal capping group</b>—The smallest representative side chain for a particular functional group.</p>
        <p><b>Minimally capped core</b>—A core with the appropriate minimal capping group at each attachment position.</p>
        <p><b>Protocore</b>—A molecule that could be used to replace the core molecule, and that has hydrogen atoms where the side chains should be attached.</p>
        <p><b>Reagent</b>—The chemical reagent used in the combinatorial synthesis; a structure or set of structures with the same chemical composition and heavy-atom connectivity that is used to add a side chain to the core. A reagent may encompass more than one structure if it exists in more than one form (different tautomers, conformers, stereoisomers, protonation state).</p>
        <p><b>Reagent variant</b>—A single reagent structure, defined by a particular tautomer, conformer, stereoisomer, and protonation state of the reagent.</p>
        <p><b>Side chains</b>—The structural elements of a combinatorial library that are varied within the library. The side chain is the part of a reagent that remains after removing the reactive functional group that is discarded when it is bound to the core.</p>
        <p><b>Structure</b>—A molecule with a particular geometry and stereochemistry, in a single tautomeric form, ionization state, and conformation.</p>
        <p><b>User-capped core</b>—The molecule that was used to define the core. The capping groups are the side chains from this molecule. </p>
        <p><b>Type</b>—The list of chemical features that can be found in a side chain.</p>
