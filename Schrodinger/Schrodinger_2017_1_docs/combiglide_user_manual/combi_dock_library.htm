        <h1 class="Title">Combinatorial Screening: Docking the Library</h1>
        <p>The docking step is the heart of the combinatorial screening process, where the docking jobs are run to screen out molecules that do not dock well and thereby eliminate reagents. This step is carried out in the <span class="GUI">Dock Library</span> step of the <span class="GUI">Combinatorial Screening</span> panel.</p>
        <p>First, the core-containing structures are docked. The resulting poses are clustered, and poses from each cluster are selected until the maximum number is reached. This ensures the widest diversity of core poses while limiting their number. The core poses are used as the initial positions of the substituted molecules in the subsequent docking stages. </p>
        <p>The screening is performed in two stages. In the first stage, structures that have only a single substitution are docked. These structures are generated by adding the reagents, one at a time, to the minimally capped core or the user-capped core. The result is a set of molecules (a “single-position library”) for each attachment position with a side chain at that position and the minimal capping group at the other positions. The side chains added are taken from the expanded set of reagents, in which different ionization states, stereoisomers, conformers, or tautomers can be represented. In the pyrazole example, there are three attachment positions and thus, three single-position libraries will be generated and docked. This portion of the virtual library evaluation is an additive process: the number of dockings required for this step is the sum of the number of side chains for each position. </p>
        <p>Once the single-position docking results are returned, a selection algorithm determines which fully substituted cores have the highest probability of binding to the receptor. Structures from the single-position docking stage that do not dock well are eliminated. Reagents for which no structures docked well are removed from the reagent list for the appropriate attachment position. The selection algorithm takes into consideration the XP GlideScores of the docked poses from the single-position docking. It also checks that the side chains it has identified for a particular fully substituted core are not predicted to compete for the same part of the receptor binding site. </p>
        <p>Finally, the structures that are identified by the selection algorithm are generated and docked. This set of structures is not a combinatorial library, in which each side chain occurs at each position. </p>
        <p>As an alternative, the single-position docking and the selection procedure can be bypassed, and the entire library can be enumerated and docked. </p>
        <p>The docking task and its result are described in the topics listed below.</p>
