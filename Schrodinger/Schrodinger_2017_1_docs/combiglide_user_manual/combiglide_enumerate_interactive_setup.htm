        <h1 class="Title">Setting Up the Combinatorial Library</h1>
        <p>To set up a combinatorial library, you need to choose a core-containing molecule, define its attachment points, and add a fragment collection at each attachment point. These tasks are done in the <span class="GUI">Combinatorial Library</span> tab. You can use an existing library and modify it, or you can create a new library.</p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="interactive_enum_dock_comblib.png" style="margin: 2px;" />
        </p>
        <p class="figure" data-mc-autonum="Figure 1:"><span class="autonumber"><span>Figure 1:</span></span>The Interactive Enumeration panel, Combinatorial Library tab.</p>
        <p>You can import an existing library by choosing <span class="GUI">Combinatorial definition</span> from the <span class="GUI">Import from</span> option menu, then clicking <span class="GUI">Browse</span>. You are prompted to save or discard changes to the current library if they are not saved, then a file selector opens, in which you can navigate to an existing library, which has the suffix <code>-comdef.tar.gz</code>. The library is loaded, the core molecule is displayed with its attachment points, and the <span class="GUI">Combinatorial definition table</span> is filled in. </p>
        <p>If you want to create a new library, the first step is to import a core-containing molecule. To do so, make a choice from the <span class="GUI">Import From</span> option menu. The choices are a Maestro file (<code>.mae</code>, <code>.maegz</code>, <code>.mae.gz</code>), a combinatorial definition (<code>-comdef.tar.gz</code>), the Sketcher, the Workspace, or the Project Table. If you choose <span class="GUI">Workspace</span>, there must be a single entry in the Workspace. Likewise if you choose <span class="GUI">Project Table</span>, there must be a single entry selected in the Project Table. If you choose <span class="GUI">Maestro file</span> or <span class="GUI">Combinatorial definition</span>, a file selector opens, in which you can navigate to and select the file that contains the structure you want to use to define the core. The first structure in a Maestro file is the structure that is used. If you choose <span class="GUI">Sketcher</span>, click <span class="GUI">Sketch</span> to open the <span class="GUI">2D Workspace</span> panel, and you can draw the structure in this panel. When you click <span class="GUI">OK</span>, the structure is converted to 3D with LigPrep and imported. For information on this panel, see <a href="../maestro_tools_help/2d_sketcher.html">2D Workspace Panel</a>.</p>
        <p>When you have imported the core-containing molecule, it is displayed in the display area with any existing attachment bonds, or core positions, marked by colored arrows. The arrow color matches the rows in the <span class="GUI">Combinatorial definition</span> table. The head of the arrow indicates the fragment or atom that will be removed when a fragment (R group) is attached in this position.</p>
        <p>You can then pick bonds in the structure to define the attachment points, or core positions. If you right-click on an existing core position, the shortcut menu allows you to switch the direction of the arrow or delete it. Clicking again on the bond also changes the direction of the arrow. The direction is only changed, however, if it would not invalidate existing core positions. Each time you create a new core position, it is added to the <span class="GUI">Combinatorial definition table</span>. The selected position is highlighted in olive-green in the table and the arrow is outlined in black in the display area. </p>
        <p>To delete a core position, right-click on the arrow in the display area or in the table row and choose <span class="GUI">Delete</span>. </p>
        <p>The <span class="GUI">Combinatorial definition table</span> lists each core position, along with information about the position and its attachments: the number of structures in the fragment collection used at this position, the minimum and maximum number of methylene linkers, and the name of the fragment collection file. The fragment collection itself for a given core position is shown in the <span class="GUI">Fragment Collection</span> tab, which is described in the next section.</p>
        <p>When a core position is first selected, a default name is created and the numbers in the columns are set to zero. You can edit the name by clicking in the table cell and changing the text. The fragment collection for this position in the <span class="GUI">Fragment Collection</span> tab is initially empty, by default. To associate a fragment collection with this position, you can create one in the <span class="GUI">Fragment Collection</span> tab, or you can read one from file. You can also use the <span class="GUI">Default collection file</span> buttons to set up or clear a default fragment collection, which is automatically added to a position when you create it. Click <span class="GUI">Set</span>, and navigate to the collection file in the file selector that opens, to define a default collection; click <span class="GUI">Clear</span> to return to having no default collection.</p>
        <p>To read a new collection from file, right-click on the selected row of the table and choose either <span class="GUI">Replace Collection</span> or <span class="GUI">Append to Collection</span>. It does not matter which you choose because the existing collection is empty. In the file selector that opens, you can navigate to and select a fragment collection, which has an extension of <code>.bld</code>. The directory selection includes <span class="GUI">Schrödinger Collections</span>, which supplies a default set of fragments. The directory selection also includes <span class="GUI">My Collections</span>, which is set to the <code>cg/interactive_fragments </code>subdirectory of your user resources directory (<code>$HOME/.schrodinger</code> on Linux and Mac, <code>%APPDATA%\Schrodinger</code> on Windows) as a convenient location for storing your fragment collections. Once the collection is read in, it is shown in the <span class="GUI">Fragment Collection</span> tab. The number of fragments in the file is displayed in the <span class="GUI">Number of structures</span> column.</p>
        <p>If you have created a fragment collection in the <span class="GUI">Fragment Collection</span> tab, you can apply it to the current core position by right-clicking in the table and choosing <span class="GUI">Apply Fragment Collection</span>, which replaces the current collection with the entire collection, or choosing <span class="GUI">Apply Selected Fragments</span>, which replaces the current collection with the fragments that are selected in the <span class="GUI">Fragment Collection</span> tab. A default name for the fragment file is created. You can change it by right-clicking on the table row and choosing <span class="GUI">Rename</span>. </p>
        <p>Another way of adding a collection is from the <span class="GUI">Collections</span> panel, which you open by clicking <span class="GUI">Collections</span>. You can then choose a collection from the list and drag it onto the desired attachment bond of the 2D structure in the <span class="GUI">Define Core</span> section.</p>
        <p>As well as the fragments that you define, the combinatorial library can include methylene linkers between the core and the fragment. The number of linkers is determined by the values given in the <span class="GUI">Minimum linkers</span> and <span class="GUI">Maximum linkers</span> columns, which you can edit to set the desired values.</p>
        <p>If you changed a library definition and want to revert to the original definition, click <span class="GUI">Revert</span>. All changes since the last time the library was saved are discarded and the library is reloaded. </p>
        <p>To start a new library definition, you can click <span class="GUI">Clear</span> to clear the current library definition. </p>
        <p>When you have a library that you want to save, click <span class="GUI">Export Library</span>. The library must have a fragment collection associated with each core position. A file selector opens, in which you can navigate to the desired location and name and save the library definition. </p>
