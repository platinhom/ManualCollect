        <h1 class="Title">Type Selectivity in Library Analysis</h1>
        <p>Entropy-based statistics can be used for fractional compositions that sum to unity, such as for the type data. We use a measure based on the Kullback-Liebler divergence to compute the selectivity of each position on the core. If a position has a selectivity of N, it is similar to saying that only one out of N types is selected at that position. This value would in fact apply if the types were uniformly distributed in both the initial and the final distribution, but the initial side-chain collection contained N times as many types as the final one.</p>
        <p>In the following example, we can see that position 3 of this system has a selectivity of 7, which is much greater than the selectivity observed at the other positions, which is close to 1. Position 3 is the position for which the feature data were shown earlier. It is the high degree of discrimination in types that leads to the high selectivity.</p>

        <p class="figure" data-mc-autonum="Figure 1:"><span class="autonumber"><span>Figure 1:</span></span>Overall type selectivity chart.</p>
        <p>Selectivity is always relative to the diversity of the reagent set used. If the input reagent set is already narrowly focused on the reagent types that bind, the observed overall selectivity will be low, even if the position is highly selective relative to all possible chemical types.</p>
        <p>For positions with low selectivity, the type selectivity details can help determine whether the low selectivity is due to low diversity in the reagent set or to greater discrimination at other positions. A simple measure is obtained from the number of types that appear in a reagent list. More types means more diversity. The <span class="GUI">Type Selectivity Details</span> chart, which you can display by clicking <span class="GUI">Show Type Details</span>, shows the number of types in the input reagent collections in pale blue and the number of types in the selected library in bright blue. An example is given in <a class="Figure_Number MCXref xref xrefFigure_Number selected" href="#combi_analyze_library_2566211356_745026">Figure 2</a>.</p>
        <p>In the example used for the figures, it can be seen that by this measure, the input reagent collections used at positions 1 and 2 are about as diverse than those used at position 3. Thus, using this measure of diversity, it could be concluded that the greater overall type selectivity exhibited by position 3 is intrinsic, rather than due to the use of a more diverse reagent collection at that position.</p>
        <p>A better measure of diversity takes into account the non-uniform distribution of types at a position. For example, a two-type collection is more diverse if the types occur with equal frequency than if one type occurs 99% of the time and the other occurs 1% of the time. The latter situation is little different from having only a single type present. Such a measure that is based on the statistical entropy is also included in the type selectivity details. The entropy is converted into an effective number of types. These effective numbers are displayed in light green (for the input set) and dark green (for the selected library). </p>

        <p>For the example above, the effective number of types does not change much between the positions, so again it can be concluded that the high overall type selectivity exhibited at Position 3 is intrinsic, rather than artifactual.</p>
