        <h2><a name="using"></a>Using the Feature Selection Viewer Panel</h2>
        <p>The initial set of properties displayed in the panel is selected from the hierarchical clustering results, with Kelley criteria to choose the default number of clusters.</p>
        <p>To determine how well the selected properties (reduced list) represents the orginal properties, multiple linear regression is performed for each property to calculate an R^2 value for the fit of the property by the reduced list. First, a principal components analysis is done on the reduced list and principal components are selected to account for 95% of the variance. The X variables in the PLS model are taken from the projection of the principal components onto the property data from the reduced list, and the Y variable is the original property. These R^2 values are reported in the second column of the <span class="GUI">Original properties</span> table.</p>
        <p>You can change the number of properties in the reduced list in several ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p>Select <span class="GUI">Number of clusters</span> and change the number of clusters, then click <span class="GUI">Update Properties</span>.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>Select <span class="GUI">Maximum correlation</span> and change the value of the maximum allowed correlation between properties on the reduced list, then click <span class="GUI">Update Properties</span>.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>Select a property in either of the lists and click <span class="GUI">Add</span> or <code>Remove</code>, then click <span class="GUI">Update R^2</span>.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>You might want to change the property manually if you have a preference for a particular property. The property chosen from each cluster is the one that is closest to the centroid. You might want to replace it with another property from the same cluster. To do this, it is useful to sort the list of original properties by the clustering order (right-click and choose <span class="GUI">Sort by Cluster</span>), so that properties in the same cluster are adjacent. It might also be useful to view the correlation matrix (click <span class="GUI">Correlation Matrix</span>) for the original properties, ordered by cluster, so that you can identify the properties that are in the same cluster as the one you want to replace. With cluster ordering, the heat map should have red diagonal blocks that mark the clusters.</p>
        <p>You can also sort the lists, to order the structures alphabetically or by the order produced by clustering, or in ascending or descending magnitudes of R^2. To sort the lists, right click on the column heading and choose the desired item from the shortcut menu.</p>

                <p>If you chose to remove properties from the list for which a specified percentage of the values were identical, these properties are dimmed in the list, and the cells in the <span class="GUI">R^2</span> column are colored yellow and contain text describing the elimination criterion rather than a numeric value. Likewise, if you chose to remove properties that did not meet the Shannon entropy cutoff, the cells are colored magenta and appropriate text is used instead of a value. If you did not choose to remove such properties, the cells in the <span class="GUI">R^2</span> column in which all values of the property are identical are colored red and contain the text "No Variance".</p>
                <p>Properties on this list that are also on the reduced list are dimmed, and have a line of - characters instead of a numeric value in the <span class="GUI">R^2</span> column.</p>
                <p>You can select a property in the list and click <span class="GUI">Add</span> to transfer it to the reduced list. If the property was originally on the reduced list, the cyan coloring is removed. If not, the property is colored cyan in both lists.</p>
                <p>You can sort the table columns by right clicking on the heading and choosing a sort option. The R^2 values can be sorted in ascending or descending order.
