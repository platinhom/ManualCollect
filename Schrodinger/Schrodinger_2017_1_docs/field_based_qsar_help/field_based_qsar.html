        <p>In this panel you can set up a field-based QSAR model (CoMFA/CoMSIA) from a set of aligned ligands, and use the model to predict activities for other molecules. You can also visualize the QSAR model in the Workspace and create a scatter plot of the activities.</p>
        <p>For background information, see <a href="field_based_qsar_background.html">Field-Based QSAR Background</a>.</p>
        <p class="opening">To open this panel, choose <span class="GUI">Tasks → QSAR → Field-Based</span> in the Task Tool.</p>
        <h2><a name="using"></a>Using the Field-Based QSAR Panel</h2>
        <p>To generate a QSAR model, you must first ensure that the ligands are aligned. If the ligands were exported from the Develop Common Pharmacophore Hypotheses procedure, they should already be prealigned to the pharmacophore model. You can use the Phase command-line tool <code>pharm_align_mol</code> to align ligands to a hypothesis. In Maestro, you can use the <span class="GUI">Superposition</span> panel (<span class="GUI">Tools → Superposition</span>) to align the ligands. The best choice is probably to align by a SMARTS pattern for the ligand core.</p>
