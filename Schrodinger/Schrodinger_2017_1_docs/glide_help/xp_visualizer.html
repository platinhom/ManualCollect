        <p>This panel provides a way to visualize and analyze the results of a Glide XP docking run. The panel's main functions are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">To display the XP Glide results from a pose viewer file (<i>jobname</i><tt>_pv.mae</tt>) in a table of XP terms for each ligand.</li>
            <li value="2">To provide 3D visualizations for XP terms. Information for these visualizations is read from the pose viewer file (<i>jobname</i><tt>_pv.maegz</tt>).</li>
            <li value="3">To allow selective evaluation of ligands (and groups of ligands) within the table. This helps you analyze ligands separately during the screening process.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="opening">To open this panel, choose <span class="GUI">Tasks → Receptor-Based Virtual Screening → Visualize XP Interactions</span> in the Task Tool.</p>
        <h2><a name="using"></a>Using the XP Visualizer Panel</h2>
        <p>To generate results that can be used with the Glide XP Visualizer, you must select <span class="GUI">Write XP descriptor information</span> in the <a href="dock_settings.html#xpdes_info"><span class="GUI">Settings</span> tab</a> of the <span class="GUI">Ligand Docking</span> panel, and select <span class="GUI">Pose viewer file</span> under <span class="GUI">File type</span> in the <a href="dock_output.html#feature1.1"><span class="GUI">Output</span> tab</a> of the <span class="GUI">Ligand Docking</span> panel when you run the XP docking job.</p>
        <p><b>Note:</b> To generate XP descriptor information, you must have a license for this feature.</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1"><a href="#using1">Loading the files</a>
            </li>
            <li value="2"><a href="#using2">Sorting the table</a>
            </li>
            <li value="3"><a href="#using3">Selecting cells</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3><a name="using1"></a>Loading the files</h3>
        <p>Click <span class="GUI">Open</span> to load a pose-viewer file that includes XP descriptors. When you load the file, you are prompted to choose an activity property to display in the table. If you don't want to display an activity property, click <span class="GUI">Cancel</span>.</p>
        <p>Once the files have been loaded, all of the ligands are loaded into the table, with the name of the ligand in the far left column (light blue background), along with the XP terms in the rest of the columns (light gray background). If the same ligand name is listed twice in the pose viewer file, then a <code>-</code><i>N</i> is added to the ligand name, where <i>N</i> is an integer starting with 2 that is incremented for each successive instance of a ligand name.</p>
        <h3><a name="using2"></a>Sorting the table</h3>
        <p>To sort the rows of the table by the values in a column, click on the column heading. There are three sort settings: ascending (+), descending(-), and the original pose viewer order. These settings can be changed by successively clicking on the column heading. One column can be sorted at a time.</p>
        <h3><a name="using3"></a>Selecting cells</h3>
        <p>Clicking on cells produces two different functions depending on the cell type:</p>
        <dl>
            <dt><a name="using2.1"></a>XP Term Cells</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>Cells that have a gray border around them indicate XP term values for which a visualization exists. By clicking on one of these cells, the border is enlarged (to indicate that the cell is selected) and the visualization is displayed in the Workspace. Clicking again removes the visualization. These visualizations are different depending on the XP term and are described <a href="#vis">below</a>.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt><a name="using2.2"></a>Ligand Name Cells</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>You can select multiple ligands by clicking in the <span class="GUI">Name</span> column, using shift-click and control-click. If <span class="GUI">Selected ligands</span> is selected, then Maestro shows the selected ligands and the view changes each time the selection is changed. If you select more than 100 ligands, a warning is posted, and <span class="GUI">Selected ligands</span> is turned off.</p>
                <p>Clicking <a href="#feature6"><span class="GUI">Selected Only</span></a> when there are multiple ligands selected displays only the selected ligands in the table. The sorting mechanisms now work exclusively on the ligands shown in the table. The <a href="#feature6">All</a> button is used to show all ligands in the table.</p>
            </dd>
            <p>You can step through ligands with the <span class="Keys">Left Arrow</span> and <span class="Keys">Right Arrow</span> keys. If a cell is selected, the arrow keys move up or down the column for that cell, displaying the visualization if a cell has an associated visualization.</p>

the associated visualizations are as follows:
<ul><li value="1"><span class="GUI">Charge+</span><i>value</i>—Charge penalty. Penalty for putting a ligand charge in a region without water and with the charge not in a salt bridge. Ball and stick representation for ligand atoms.</li><li value="2"><span class="GUI">Water+</span><i>value</i>—Water-protein and water-ligand penalties. Penalties for desolvating (via presence of ligand) a polar group on the protein or ligand and not making an H bond to the polar group. Ball and stick representation for ligand and protein atoms</li><li value="3"><span class="GUI">DDpen+</span><i>value</i>—Penalty for non-H-bonded donors on the ligand and protein too close together and with semi-collinear NH--HN.</li><li value="4"><span class="GUI">Blk+</span><i>value</i>—Penalty for burial of charged group on the protein by the ligand with no H bonds made to the charged group by the ligand or protein. Ball and stick representation for protein atoms</li><li value="5"><span class="GUI">Polar+</span><i>value</i>—Penalty for desolvation of a polar ligand atom in a hydrophobic protein environment. Similar to water-ligand penalty but specific to phobic environments. Ball and stick representation for protein atoms.</li><li value="6"><span class="GUI">Contact+</span><i>value</i>—Penalty for intraligand contacts. Ball and stick representation for ligand atoms</li><li value="7"><span class="GUI">PhoBl+</span><i>value</i>—Phobic ligand-protein blockage. Penalty for putting a phobic group of the ligand against polar (donor/acceptor) groups of the protein in a protein region which normally would give a favorable phobic packing score (PhobEn). Ball and stick representation for protein atoms</li></ul><p>Twisted amide linkages in the ligand are also displayed in ball-and-stick, but not labeled.</p></td>
