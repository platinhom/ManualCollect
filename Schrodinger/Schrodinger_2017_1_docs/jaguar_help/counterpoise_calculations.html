        <h1>Counterpoise Calculations</h1>
        <p>Counterpoise calculations are a way to correct dissociation energies for the finite size of the basis set used.</p>
        <p>In a molecule, the basis set for an atom is effectively enlarged by the basis sets on nearby atoms: basis functions on neighboring atoms can fill in the holes in the basis set. The energy that would be cacluated for that atom inside the molecule is lowered relative to the isolated atom by the presence of neighboring basis sets. The error due to the difference in basis sets between the molecule and the isolated atoms is called <i>basis set superposition error</i> (BSSE).</p>
        <p>So if we calculate the energy of a hydrogen bond by first calculating the energy of the complex, then subtracting the energies calculated for the isolated molecules, we will overestimate the strength of the bond. Counterpoise calculations correct for this overestimation by using the basis set for the entire system for the isolated molecule rather than just the basis set for the isolated molecule itself. Then the molecule benefits from the extra basis functions both in the complex and in isolation, and the effects of the extra basis functions cancel to some extent.</p>
        <p>Counterpoise-corrected dissociation energies require several calculations:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">Geometry optimization of the complex (or molecule) whose dissociation energy you want to calculate in the basis set of the complex.</li>
            <li value="2">Geometry optimization of the fragments in the basis sets of the fragments.</li>
            <li value="3">Single-point calculations on the fragments at the geometry of the complex in the basis sets of the fragments.</li>
            <li value="4">Single-point calculations on the fragments at the geometry of the complex in the basis set of the complex.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The difference between the first and the second gives the uncorrected dissociation energy. It is the last two that provide the counterpoise correction, which is the difference between the energies from the third and fourth calculations, and is positive.</p>
        <p>Jaguar provides the <span class="GUI">Counterpoise</span> panel for calculation of the counterpoise-corrected dissociation energy of non-bonded complexes. In this panel you can make settings for the basis set, level of theory, SCF convergence, and geometry optimization. You can run multiple complexes, and distribute the calculations over multiple processors. The counterpoise-corrected energy for each complex is calculated and returned.</p>
        <p>There is also a panel for calculating energies of hydrogen-bonded complexes, with a specific protocol for the calculationsâ€”see the topic <a href="hydrogen_bond.html">Jaguar Hydrogen Bond Energies</a> for details.</p>
        <p>For other types of counterpoise calculations, such as breaking covalent bonds, you will need to set up the input files for the calculations. Jaguar's facility for counterpoise calculations is general, so it can be applied in any situation. To do a calculation on a fragment in the basis of the complex, you use the input file for the complex. The atoms of the complex that are <i>not</i> in the fragment must be identified, which is done by placing an @ character after the atom name in the <b>zmat</b> section, e.g.</p>
        <p><code>Na4@ 0.00000 0.00000 4.00000</code>
        </p>
        <p>This makes the atom a "ghost" atom, i.e. one with no nucleus and no electrons, only a basis set where the atom would otherwise be. Having set up the input files, you will have to run a job for each, and then calculate the counterpoise-corrected dissociation energy from the resulting energies.
