        <h1 class="Title">Overview of SiteMap</h1>
        <p>The location of the primary binding site on a receptor such as a protein is often known from the structure of a co-crystallized complex. Efforts to design better ligands for these receptors can profit from an understanding of how well the known ligands complement the receptor, and how extension of the ligands into adjacent regions could promote binding. Determining whether there are nearby sites that might be useful for allosteric binding can also be important. </p>
        <p>In some cases, however, the location of a binding site for protein-ligand or protein-protein interactions is not known in advance, even though the protein structures are available. Here, computational studies can help to suggest likely binding sites, and even to predict whether a given protein is likely to bind ligands tightly. Many such approaches have been explored; for references, see the paper by Nayal and Honig <a class="Reference_Number MCXref xref xrefReference_Number" href="sitemap_references.htm#sitemap_references_4211153202_742127" xrefformat="[{color #0E6895}{paranumonly}{/color}]">[<span style="color: #0e6895;" class="mcFormatColor">1</span>]</a>.</p>
        <p>SiteMap <a class="Reference_Number MCXref xref xrefReference_Number" href="sitemap_references.htm#sitemap_references_4211153202_743608" xrefformat="[{color #0E6895}{paranumonly}{/color}]">[<span style="color: #0e6895;" class="mcFormatColor">2</span>]</a> generates information on the character of binding sites using novel search and analysis facilities, and provides information to Maestro for visualization of the sites. A SiteMap calculation begins with an initial search stage that determines one or more regions on or near the protein surface, called <i>sites,</i> that may be suitable for binding of a ligand to the receptor. The search uses a grid of points, called <i>site points</i>, to locate the sites. In the second stage, contour maps (<i>site maps</i>) are generated, producing hydrophobic and hydrophilic maps. The hydrophilic maps are further divided into donor, acceptor, and metal-binding regions. The evaluation stage, which concludes the calculation, assesses each site by calculating various properties, which are added to the Maestro project. </p>
        <p>Site maps can aid in the design of better ligands, by revealing “targets of opportunity”—for example, hydrophobic regions that have room to accommodate a larger hydrophobic group. Site maps can also be used to select the target for ligand docking with Glide and to evaluate docking hits, by showing how well the poses display proper complementarity to the receptor. The regions that are neither hydrophobic nor hydrophilic are important because they show places in which it may be possible to improve the physical properties of the ligand—for example, by changing the solubility—with minimal effect on the binding affinity. </p>
        <p>In contrast to techniques that color-code the receptor surface to represent hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity, site maps depend on the site as a whole, not just the character of the nearest receptor atom. Moreover, site maps explicitly show the shape and extent of philic and phobic regions, something a surface-based display cannot do. </p>
        <p>The most important property generated by SiteMap is an overall SiteScore, which has proven to be effective at identifying known binding sites in co-crystallized complexes. Other properties characterize the binding site in terms of:</p>
        <ul class="ListCompact">
            <li value="1">the size of the site, 
    </li>
            <li value="2">the degrees of enclosure by the protein and exposure to solvent, 
    </li>
            <li value="3">the tightness with which the site points interact with the receptor, 
    </li>
            <li value="4">the hydrophobic and hydrophilic character of the site and the balance between them, 
    </li>
            <li value="5">the degree to which a ligand might donate or accept hydrogen bonds. 
    </li>
        </ul>
