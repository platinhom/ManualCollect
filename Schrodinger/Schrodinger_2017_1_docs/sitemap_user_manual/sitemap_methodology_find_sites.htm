        <h1 class="Title">How SiteMap Finds Binding Sites</h1>
        <p>The first stage of a SiteMap calculation is to locate the sites. A <i>site</i> is defined by a set of site points on a grid that are either contiguous or bridged by short gaps in solvent-exposed regions. The site-finding algorithm begins by placing a 1-Å grid of possible site points around the entire protein or around a placeholder species, such as a ligand. Identifying the sites involves several steps. </p>
        <p>The first step is to classify the grid points as being either “inside” or “outside” the protein. The distance from each grid point to nearby protein atoms is compared to the van der Waals radius of each protein atom. If the ratio of the squares of these distances is larger than a given threshold, the point is considered to be outside the protein. </p>
        <p>In the next step, the “outside” points are examined to determine which ones are in sufficiently good van der Waals contact with the receptor and sufficiently enclosed by the receptor to serve as site points. Enclosure is defined by sampling all possible directions from the grid point and determining the fraction of these directions (“rays”) that strike the surface within a given distance. If the fraction is larger than a given threshold, the point is sufficiently enclosed and is therefore a candidate site point. The contact with the receptor is determined by a cutoff on the van der Waals interaction energy at the site point: if the interaction energy is too small in magnitude, the point is rejected. Points that meet all criteria are added to the list of site points.</p>
        <p>The third step combines site points into distinct site-point groups. For a site point to be considered for membership in a group, it must have a minimum number of candidate site points within a given distance. Site points that do not have this minimum number are discarded. The process starts by assigning a site point to a group, then adding all candidate site points within a prescribed minimum distance. The addition process is repeated for each new site point. When no further site points can be added, the group is considered complete and another site-point group is initiated. The process continues until all site points have been examined. </p>
        <p>The final step merges site-point groups when the gap between them is relatively small and occurs in a solvent-exposed region. The merge is controlled by user-adjustable thresholds that determine how close two site-point groups must be for them to be considered for merging and whether the gap between them could plausibly be bridged by ligand atoms. The final groups constitute the sites.</p>
        <p>The sites are written in order of the number of site points they contain to a Maestro file. Each site point is represented by a dummy atom, and zero-order bonds are used to join the site points for each site into a “structure” that Maestro recognizes as a single molecule. </p>
