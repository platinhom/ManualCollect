        <h1 class="Title">An Illustrative Application of QSite</h1>
        <p>Cytochrome P-450 is an enzyme whose variants are ubiquitously distributed across a wide variety of organisms. A human version of the enzyme in the liver is of great importance pharmaceutically because it is involved in a significant fraction of toxicity and drug metabolic pathways. While a high-resolution structure of a form of the human enzyme relevant to questions of toxicology and metabolism does not yet exist, such structures are likely to be produced in the next few years (either experimentally or via homology modeling). This will open the possibility of computer modeling of these critical processes. </p>
        <p>It is very difficult to study the chemistry of ligand binding of cytochrome P450 with conventional molecular-modeling techniques. The existence of a reactive metal center, and the centrality of the reactive chemistry in the interaction of the enzyme with various drug candidates, mandate a quantum-chemical treatment of the active site. On the other hand, the protein structure is clearly important in selectivity, binding affinity, and reaction kinetics, and cannot be incorporated to any great degree with conventional quantum-chemical techniques. QSite is well suited to addressing this problem with relatively modest computational resources. Its application to a problem in cytochrome P450 chemistry <a class="Reference_Number MCXref xref xrefReference_Number" href="qsite_references.htm#qsite_technotes_467258911_743825">[<span style="color: #0e6895;" class="mcFormatColor">6</span>]</a> is recounted below.</p>

        <p class="Indented1">The 1phf structure has a 4-phenylimidazole complexed with Fe. On the opposite side of the heme, Fe is coordinated to a cysteinate sulfur (R-S<sup>−</sup>). Thus, the Fe is in a six-fold coordination site and is assumed to be Fe<sup>3+</sup>, given the S<sup>−</sup> formal charge and the two negative charges distributed over the four coordinating nitrogens in the heme ring system. The net spin state is either a doublet, with the Fe-S moiety low-spin coupled as in the coordinated dioxygen state of P-450, or a high-spin quartet. There are 7075 atoms in the system.</p>
        <p class="Indented1">The QM region is the full heme ring, the Fe, the full coordinating cysteine residue including residues on either side of the cysteine, and the 4-phenylimidazole. The two QM-MM cuts were made in the residues adjacent to the coordinating cysteine. The net charge of the QM region is −2 from the two carboxylate groups on the heme. There are 125 total quantum atoms and 1138 6-31G* basis functions. The QM method used was B3LYP DFT. The outer shell of the protein was frozen during the optimization, leaving 3960 of the 7075 atoms free to optimize. This procedure is commonly used to avoid irrelevant energy differences caused by re-arrangements of the outer parts of the protein. </p>

The camphor is not directly bound to the Fe but, like the phenylimidazole ligand, has forced water out of the heme-binding region. The main purpose of running this system was to find the lowest spin state of the substrate-free P-450.</p>

In a general study of a system like this, the initial cost of this minimization would be amortized over similar runs in which the QM region would be perturbed (by changing the ligand, for example) since these subsequent runs would have a good initial geometry. </p>
        <p class="Indented1">As an initial calibration of the energetics we optimized the doublet and quartet spin states of the system. The doublet was found to be 14 kcal/mol lower in energy.

The substrate-free system with the camphor above the heme ring was found after full QM-MM optimization to have a high-spin quartet ground state with the doublet 15 kcal/mol higher in energy.
