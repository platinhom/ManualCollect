        <p>The <span class="GUI">R-Group Analysis</span> panel identifies the groups that are attached to a core and provides tools for displaying properties of the R groups and for exporting them to files. The core can be taken from CombiGlide attachment bond labeling, specified by a SMARTS pattern, or determined by the maximum common substructure obtained from a Canvas MCS run.</p>
        <h2><a name="using"></a>Using the R-Group Analysis Panel</h2>
        <p>As well as running from Maestro or Canvas, you can open the <span class="GUI">R-Group Analysis</span> panel from the command line with the following command:</p>
        <p><code>$SCHRODINGER/run r_group_analysis.py</code>
        </p>
        <p>When using SMARTS or CanvasMCS to define a core, the resulting R groups may be surprising. Some of the situations that can arise are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p>R groups attached with multiple bonds: Carbonyl is an example. These are displayed in the viewer as expected.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>R groups attached in multiple positions (forming rings): An R group connected at multiple attachment points is displayed in the fragment viewer for each attachment position. At each position, the attachment bond is displayed with the same orientation and color shown for the corresponding attachment bond on the core and the other fragments in the current fragment display. The additional attachment bonds on the fragment are displayed with colors corresponding to those shown in the core display, but their orientations might not match those in the core display.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>Attachment points on the core that, for some input structures, have no R groups at all. An example is a furan oxygen which, in another input structure, has a substituted carbon in the corresponding position. If the furan structure is shown in the core display, a dummy atom is added to the furan oxygen to enable a marker arrow denoting the attachment bond to be drawn. The dummy atom is displayed as "Null".</p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p>Attachment bonds within a ring. An example is two attachment bonds within a ring pointing toward the same ring atom. This means that the discovered MCS includes the remaining ring atoms; the atom pointed toward is not part of the core, but is a multiply connected R group.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
