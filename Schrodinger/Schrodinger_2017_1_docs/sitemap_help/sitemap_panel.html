        <h1 class="title">SiteMap Panel</h1><a name="summary"></a>
        <p>SiteMap is a tool for finding, visualizing and characterizing protein binding sites. Sites are represented as collections of site points at or near the surface of a protein that are contiguous or are separated in solvent-exposed region by short gaps that could plausibly be spanned by ligand functionality. The visualization uses a grid of points to identify potential hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions; the hydrophilic regions are further classified into hydrogen-bond donor, hydrogen-bond acceptor, and metal-binding regions, and the surface of the protein is contoured. These regions can be displayed in the Workspace.</p>
        <p>Key properties, including an overall SiteScore that gauges the propensity of the site to bind ligands tightly, are returned to the Project Table. Other properties measure the exposure of the site to solvent, its degree of enclosure by the protein, the tightness with which the site points interact with the protein ("contact"), the degree of hydrophobicity of the site, the degree of hydrophilicity, the balance between the two, and the extent to which a ligand would be likely to donate, rather than accept, hydrogen bonds ("don/acc"). SiteScore and the contact, phobic, and philic properties are expressed relative to the average value found for a large number of protein sites that bind ligands tightly.</p>
        <p class="opening">To open this panel, choose <span class="GUI">Tasks → Structure Analysis → Binding Site Detection</span> in the Task Tool.</p>
        <h2><a name="using"></a>Using the SiteMap Panel</h2>
        <p>To set up a SiteMap calculation:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>Display the protein in the Workspace. If you want to find all sites, ensure that only the protein is displayed, without cofactors, waters, or ligands. If you want to map a particular site that is defined by a molecule, include that molecule in the Workspace along with the protein.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>Open the <span class="GUI">SiteMap</span> panel.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>Select the task in the <span class="GUI">Specify task</span> section. If you want to characterize a single region, you must also select a molecule or entry to be used to define the region to be characterized. The atoms of this molecule or entry must not be part of the protein.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p>Make any settings in the <span class="GUI">Settings</span> section to define the sites and the output.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="5">
                <p>Choose <span class="GUI">Job Settings</span> from the <span class="GUI">Settings</span> button menu,</p> <img src="../Resources/Images/Toolbuttons/settings.png" /> <p>set the job parameters in the <span class="GUI">Job Settings</span> dialog box, and click <span class="GUI">Run</span> to run the job.</p></li>
        </ol>
        <p>When the job is finished, the site maps are incorporated and displayed in the Workspace. The <span class="GUI">Manage Surfaces</span> panel is also opened so that you can manage the display of the site maps.</p>

        <p>In this section you can choose whether to examine the entire protein for potential binding sites, or restrict the search to a given region.</p>

            <dt><a name="feature2.1"></a><span class="GUI">Identify top-ranked potential receptor binding sites</span> option</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>Identify potential binding sites on the surface of the receptor, rank them and return the top-ranking sites. The atoms in the Workspace are taken to be the receptor, so you should ensure that only the receptor is displayed. This is the default option.</p>

            <dt><a name="feature2.2"></a><span class="GUI">Evaluate a single binding site region</span> option</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>This option allows you to evaluate the region of the receptor that is within a specified distance of selected non-receptor atoms, such as a ligand. You can set the distance in the <span class="GUI">Region about selected atoms plus <i>N</i>&#160;Å buffer will be examined</span> text box. The atoms can be selected in the <span class="GUI">Select non-receptor atoms defining region to evaluate</span> section. You can pick an entry or a molecule using the <span class="GUI">Pick</span> menu. The identity of the structure you pick is shown in the <span class="GUI">ASL</span> text box. The <span class="GUI">X</span> button clears the ASL expression. If you have <span class="GUI">Show markers</span> selected, the picked atoms are marked in the Workspace. You must have only the receptor and the picked structure in the Workspace, as everything that is not the picked structure is taken to be the receptor.</p>

            <dd>
                <p>Set the minimum number of site point required to define a site. The default value is 15 site points; with default settings the average number in examined sites that bind ligands tightly is 150. This minimum applies to the second and subsequent sites; SiteMap always reports at least one site that contains the minimum number of points required to recognize a site, which is 3. This setting is not relevant when you select <span class="GUI">Characterize a single binding site region</span>.</p>

            <dt><a name="feature3.2"></a><span class="GUI">Report up to <i>n</i> sites</span> text box</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>Specify the number of sites to report in the output. Sites are ordered by the number of points they contain. The default is 5 sites. This option is not available if <span class="GUI">Characterize a single binding site region</span> is selected.</p>

            <dt><a name="feature3.3"></a><span class="GUI">Use definition of hydrophobicity</span> option menu</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>Choose from <span class="GUI">more restrictive</span> and <span class="GUI">less restrictive</span>. The more restrictive option excludes points that border on too many assigned philic points, that have too few neighbors that are classified as phobic or inside the protein, or that border on too many points that occupy free space. In addition, regions that are exposed to solvent are assigned reduced hydrophobicity. The less restrictive option includes all points that are initially classified as phobic and does not apply these exclusions and modifications.</p>

                <p>The default distance from the nearest site point at which to crop the individual site maps for display. The default choice is 4&#160;Å. This option does not affect the data, only the display. A different value can be specified later in the <span class="GUI">Manage Surfaces</span> panel.</p>
