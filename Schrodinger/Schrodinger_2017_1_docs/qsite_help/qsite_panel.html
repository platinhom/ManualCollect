        <h1 class="title">QSite Panel</h1><a name="summary"></a>
        <p>QSite performs mixed quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) calculations, using Jaguar for the QM calculations and Impact for the MM calculations. Ligands and other specified regions of a protein complex can be studied using QM while MM is used for the rest of the complex.</p>
        <p>At each step of a QM geometry optimization, Impact calculates energy terms for MM-QM region interactions; if MM minimization was also specified, it is also performed at each QM step. The next QM step takes into account the new MM atom distribution and energy terms. If a single-point QM calculation is selected, the current QM/MM energy is calculated without MM minimization.</p>
        <p class="opening">To open this panel, choose <span class="GUI">Tasks → Applications → Other Applications → QSite</span> in the Task Tool.</p>
        <h2><a name="using"></a>Using the QSite Panel</h2>
        <p>A QSite calculation can only be performed using a single entry. If the ligand and receptor are separate entries in the Project Table, they should be combined into a single entry using the <a href="../maestro_projects_help/entry_combine.html"><span class="GUI">Merge</span> option</a> from the <span class="GUI">Entry</span> menu in the <span class="GUI">Project Table</span> panel. The merged entry should be the only entry included in the Workspace when you start the job.</p>
        <p>One exception to this is when setting up a transition-state search. In this case you may select up to three Project Table entries, depending upon the algorithm that is chosen for performing the search. Transition-state searches are described in the <a href="qm_optimization_tab.html"><span class="GUI">Optimization</span> tab</a> topic.</p>
        <p>When you have set the options in the <span class="GUI">QSite</span> panel tabs to the desired value, choose <span class="GUI">Job Settings</span> from the <span class="GUI">Settings</span> button menu on the job toolbar.</p>
        <img src="../Resources/Images/Toolbuttons/settings.png" />
        <p>The <span class="GUI">QSite - Job Settings</span> dialog box opens, and you can make settings for incorporation of results and the job name, and select the host to run the job. The default job name is <tt>qsite</tt>. See the <a href="../maestro_help/job_settings.html">Job Settings Dialog Box</a> topic for descriptions of these options.</p>
        <p>The <span class="GUI">QSite - Job Settings</span> dialog box also includes a <span class="GUI">CPUs</span> text box. The QM (Jaguar) portion of the QSite job can be run in parallel if multiple processors are available. Specify the number of processors that will be used for the QM calculation in this text box.</p>
        <p>When you have selected job options, click <span class="GUI">Save and Run</span> to run the job.</p>
        <p>If you have already made job settings, you can enter a job name in the <span class="GUI">Job name</span> text box in the <span class="GUI">QSite</span> panel, and click <span class="GUI">Run</span> to start the job with the current settings.</p>
        <p>If a QSite job needs to be restarted, you can read the restart file by choosing <span class="GUI">Read</span> from the <span class="GUI">Settings</span> button menu. The controls in the <span class="GUI">QSite</span> panel are set from the information in the restart file, and you can simply resubmit the job.</p>
        <p>The speed of QSite is largely determined by the size of the QM region. Therefore there is no advantage to making a smaller model protein. QSite automatically selects the required Impact executable for the size of the protein.</p>
        <p>See the <a href="../qsite_user_manual/qsite_user_manualTOC.htm" target="pdfmanuals"><i>QSite User Manual</i></a> for more information.</p>
        <h2><a name="rules"></a>Rules and Procedures for Creating the QM/MM Boundary</h2>
        <p>There are three general ways to define the QM/MM boundary for QSite. Two methods set the boundary across a covalent bond. In the frozen orbital method, the boundary must be placed across a bond to an alpha carbon in an amino acid residue. Special parameters are used to properly describe the energetics associated with motion of the atoms at the QM/MM interface. The link-atom method, also called the hydrogen-cap method, can be used with any single bond, regardless of the elements at the ends of the bond. The bond in this method is capped with a hydrogen atom, which leaves a chemically well-defined structure with no dangling bonds. The third method can be used only for free (i.e., not covalently bound to anything) molecules or ions. In this method the entire molecule or ion is placed in the QM region, and the QM/MM "boundary" is simply in the space between the free molecule and the rest of the structure.</p>
        <p>A more detailed discussion of each type of boundary definition follows.</p>
        <h3>Side Chain Cuts (frozen-orbital method)</h3>
        <p>To place the QM/MM boundary between an amino acid side chain and the protein backbone, choose <span class="GUI">Side chain </span> from the <span class="GUI">Pick</span> option menu and click on any atom in the residue. The side chain for that residue will be placed in the QM region.</p>
        <p>Side chain cuts are not possible in PRO, and are not permitted in GLY or ALA because the side chains are so small. Side chain cuts are also not permitted if the side chain has been modified within 3 atoms of the alpha carbon atom.</p>
        <h3>Backbone Cuts (frozen-orbital method)</h3>
        <p>In order to define a cut along the protein backbone, choose <span class="GUI">Entire residue</span> from the <span class="GUI">Pick</span> option menu. You must now click on two atoms to define the range of residues to be placed into the QM region. All residues in between the two selected atoms will treated as part of the QM region.</p>
        <p>Backbone cuts are placed in a bond to an alpha carbon that is in an amino acid residue, but you may click on any atom in a residue to define a backbone cut. The rule is that the cut will be placed so as to ensure that the atom you select ends up in the QM region. After you have selected two atoms, Maestro highlights the QM region so that you can see how big it is and where the QM/MM boundary cuts are located.</p>
        <p>A backbone cut cannot be placed between an amino acid residue and an end cap. The end cap must be included in the QM region. To do this you may click on any atom in an end cap, and on any other atom in an amino acid residue further up the chain. In this case only one cut will actually be made, and all atoms from the cut to the end of the chain will be placed into the QM region.</p>
        <p>If you click twice on the same atom in an amino acid residue, then the QM/MM cuts will be set as small as possible so as to place that entire residue in the QM region.</p>
        <p>There must be at least 3 bonds between pairs of QM-MM cuts that are made along the protein backbone. This ensures that the QM/MM boundaries are kept far enough apart that they do not interfere with one another. This means that the smallest QM region that contains all of the atoms of an amino acid residue would necessarily contain an extra carbonyl group and an extra N-H bond from the neighboring residues.</p>
        <h3>Free Ligand/Ion</h3>
        <p>In order to place an entire molecule or ion into the QM region, choose <span class="GUI">Free ligand/ion</span> from the <span class="GUI">Pick</span> option menu. There are no restrictions on this selection method. Starting from the atom that you pick, the atomic connectivity (if any) is followed outward until it terminates, and all atoms found along the way are considered to be part of that molecule and are placed in the QM region.</p>
        <h3>Hydrogen Caps (link-atom method)</h3>
        <p>To cap covalent single bonds with a hydrogen atom, choose <span class="GUI">Hydrogen cap</span> from the <span class="GUI">Pick</span> option menu. You must now click on two atoms. The first atom is placed in the QM region. The second atom is replaced with a hydrogen atom (but generally at a closer distance to the QM atom since bonds to hydrogen are shorter than bonds to other elements). Once you have capped all desired bonds, click <span class="GUI">Update QM Region Display</span>. Maestro highlights all atoms connected directly or indirectly to the hydrogen caps, and places these into the QM region. If Maestro highlights many more atoms than you expect, it probably means that you omitted a hydrogen cap somewhere such that your QM region is still covalently bound to the rest of the system.</p>
        <p>The MM sides of two hydrogen caps must have at least three bonds between them in the MM region. That is, the MM atoms replaced by hydrogens must be at least three bonds apart if all atoms between them are MM atoms. There are no such restrictions on the QM sides for hydrogen caps.</p>
        <h3>Recommendations and Limitations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p>The hydrogen-cap method is quite general, and not limited to protein-ligand complexes. You can use it on any large molecular system, subject to the limitations of atom types and force field parameters for the atoms that you place in the MM region. There are a few atom types for metals, but in many cases metals and their attached ligands will have to be included in the QM region.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>If you are working with proteins, and if you want to place in the QM region a residue whose side chain has been modified, such as by covalently attaching a ligand or some other chemical functionality, then you may not be able to make side chain cuts (see the above discussion of side chain cuts). You may make backbone cuts so as to place the entire modified residue in the QM region, or you may use hydrogen caps.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>To include disulfide bridges or other bridging species in the QM region, you may either use backbone cuts or hydrogen caps.</p>
