        <h1 class="Title">Glide Extra-Precision Mode</h1>
        <p>The extra-precision (XP) mode of Glide combines a powerful sampling protocol with the use of a custom scoring function designed to identify ligand poses that would be expected to have unfavorable energies, based on well-known principles of physical chemistry. The presumption is that only active compounds will have available poses that avoid these penalties and also receive favorable scores for appropriate hydrophobic contact between the protein and the ligand, hydrogen-bonding interactions, and so on. The chief purposes of the XP method are to weed out false positives and to provide a better correlation between good poses and good scores.</p>
        <p>Extra-precision<span class="GUI"></span>mode is a refinement tool designed for use only on good ligand poses. The more extensive XP docking method and specialized XP scoring method are strongly coupled: the more precise poses produced by XP docking are necessary for the more demanding XP scoring method. Because XP docking mode requires considerably more CPU time, you should screen large sets of ligands first in standard-precision (SP) mode or in high-throughput virtual screening (HTVS) mode. Only the top-scoring ligands should be docked using XP mode.</p>
        <p>In any grid-based docking method, the receptor is essentially frozen. Some degree of flexibility can be introduced by scaling parts of the potential, as is done in SP mode, but such techniques cannot represent larger adjustments to the receptor, like conformational changes. XP mode is less forgiving than SP mode so that it can screen out false positives, and is designed to locate active compounds that bind to a particular conformation of the receptor. Active compounds can be prevented from docking if these compounds are not compatible with the particular conformation of the receptor that is being used. To ensure that actives are not eliminated you should if possible dock into multiple receptor conformations and combine the results of the individual docking runs.</p>
        <p>The XP sampling method is based on an anchor and refined growth strategy. Anchor fragments of the docked ligand, typically rings, are chosen from the set of SP poses and the molecule is re-grown bond by bond from these anchor positions. Complete minimizations and XP scoring are carried out on the large ensemble of poses generated by this growing method. At various cycles the growing is focused to attempt to relieve any XP scoring penalties as well as to optimize the best scoring poses. This focused sampling is essential for allowing the use of the hard XP scoring function as well as for finding the best scoring basins of attraction. It is important to note that the coupling between the extra sampling and the XP scoring means that it is not recommended to just score the SP poses with XP scoring.</p>
        <p>The scoring function (GlideScore XP) includes additional terms over the SP scoring function, and a more complete treatment of some of the SP terms, as described below. </p>
        <p>To model solvation, explicit water molecules are docked into a list of protein-ligand complexes that otherwise receive good GlideScores, and descriptors based on the interaction of these water molecules with various charged and polar groups of the ligand and protein are used as a measure of whether the complex is physically realistic. Penalties are assigned to structures where statistical results indicate that one or more groups is inadequately solvated. A large database of co-crystallized structures has been used to optimize the parameters associated with the penalty terms. The explicit-water technology and descriptors are also used in Glide SP scoring. However, the improved sampling allows XP docking to assign substantially higher penalties to serious violations of physical principles.</p>
        <p>GlideScore XP specifically rewards occupancy of well-defined hydrophobic pockets by hydrophobic ligand groups. Hydrophobic reward terms are employed in empirical scoring functions such as ChemScore and the SP version of GlideScore in the form of lipophilic-lipophilic pair terms, while other empirical scoring functions use lipophilic surface-area contact terms for this purpose. Investigations have shown that simple pair terms underestimate hydrophobic effects in certain well-defined cases. The hydrophobic term in GlideScore XP was developed to offset this underestimation. The term can confer up to several kcal/mol of additional binding energy in favorable cases, and substantially improves enrichment factors GlideScore XP also includes improvements to the scoring of hydrogen bonds as well as detection of buried polar groups, and detection of pi-cation and pi-pi stacking interactions.</p>
