        <h1 class="Title">Defining Rotatable Groups for Receptor Grid Generation</h1>
        <p>The hydroxyl groups in residues such as Ser, Thr, and Tyr and the thiol group in Cys can adopt different orientations with different ligands. Glide can allow such groups to adopt different orientations when ligands are docked, to produce the most favorable interaction. For Ser and Thr, the hydroxyls can be oriented in any of the three local minima, and likewise for the thiol of Cys; for Tyr, they can be in either of the two local minima. The <span class="GUI">Rotatable Groups</span> tab allows you to choose which of these groups should be treated flexibly. </p>

        <p class="figure" data-mc-autonum="Figure 1:"><span class="autonumber"><span>Figure 1:</span></span>The Rotatable Groups tab of the Receptor Grid Generation panel.</p>
        <p>The <span class="GUI">Available groups</span> table is loaded by default with a list of all rotatable groups within the grid box. The group is identified by the hydrogen atom number and the residue (chain, number, name). By default, none of them are selected for use. You can then choose the groups that you want to include in the grid generation either by selecting them in the <span class="GUI">Allow rotation </span>column of the table, or by selecting <span class="GUI">Pick groups</span> and picking the hydrogens of the groups in the Workspace. The selected groups are marked in the Workspace. Clicking a second time, either in the column or in the Workspace, deselects the group. Clicking <span class="GUI">Deselect All</span> deselects all groups (which has the effect of turning off the use of rotatable groups).</p>
        <p>If you have previously prepared grids with flexible groups, and you are using the receptor from a file that was written by Glide, the existing selection is loaded by default. The rotatable group information is added to the receptor structure when it is written out by Glide.</p>
        <p>You cannot create constraints to flexible groups.</p>
        <p>When docking ligands with flexible groups, the time taken is longer than for a non-flexible docking calculation, but significantly shorter than docking with all possible combinations of flexible group orientations. For example, with 4 flexible groups, an SP docking run takes about twice as long as a run with no flexible groups, and an XP docking run takes about 4 times longer. If each of these groups can take two possible orientations, there are 16 combinations. To dock to all of these combinations without allowing flexibility would therefore require 16 grid calculations and 16 non-flexible docking runs, and the results from the individual runs would have to be collated at the end. </p>
