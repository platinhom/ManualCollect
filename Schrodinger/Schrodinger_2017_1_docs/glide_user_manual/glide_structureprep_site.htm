        <h1 class="Title"><b>Choosing the Most Appropriate Protein Site</b>
        </h1>
        <p>Glide relies on the rigid-receptor approximation in order to treat protein-ligand binding. However, protein conformations are in general flexible and can occupy a continuum of states. Proteins can exhibit induced fit effects on binding of a ligand, in which the protein conformation changes significantly. This effect can be seen in cases where more that one co-crystallized complex is available. Since Glide docking experiments employ only a single protein geometry, two approaches are commonly taken. One is to select a single well-suited representative protein structure to dock into. The other is to use an ensemble of representative structures, into which each of the candidate ligands is docked.</p>
        <p>If more than one co-crystallized complex is available, you must decide whether to select a single protein site or to choose two or more sites for use in independent docking experiments. This choice may depend on whether the protein site is rigid or mobile, as well as on the resources available and the objectives of the docking study. A single representative site should suffice for a rigid protein. Cases in which the site changes substantially as different ligands bind may require the use of two or more sites, if finding the maximum number of promising ligands is the main objective.</p>
        <p>Some proteins are known to be rigid. To determine whether a single site is likely to be sufficient in other cases, you can transpose the known protein-ligand complexes into the coordinate frame of a “reference” complex. The objective is to judge whether the reference site is compatible with all the co-crystallized ligands or whether another site appears more suitable. A procedure for making this determination is as follows:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>Choose a reference complex and superimpose all the other complexes to it. </p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>You can perform this task in Maestro with the <span class="GUI">Superposition</span> panel. The atoms you choose to superimpose could be the alpha carbons, or all the backbone atoms for residues in common, or the C<span class="Symbol">a</span> or backbone atoms for selected active-site residues. Alternatively, you can use the <span class="GUI">Protein Structure Alignment</span> facility to perform the superposition in an automated fashion.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>Display the protein for the reference complex and the ligand for each of the other complexes, in turn. Examine the active-site region to determine whether the superimposed ligand can fit into the reference site without steric clashes that could not reasonably be relieved by minor repositioning. You can use the <span class="GUI">Interactions</span> tool  on the <span class="GUI">Workspace Configuration</span> toolbar to examine contacts.</p>

                </p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p>Display the protein for the reference complex and the protein for each of the other complexes in turn. Note whether any residues in the superimposed protein differ appreciably in position or conformation from those in the reference site.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="5">
                <p>From the above steps, judge whether the reference site appears compatible with all the co-crystallized ligands or, if not, whether another site appears more compatible.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="6">
                <p>Choose a most representative (i.e., fairly generous) site for docking—or choose two or more sites if there are large differences between the sites and the objective is to find as many prospective strong binders as possible.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="7">
                <p>Write out a separate file for the protein or proteins that will be prepared. Also write out separate files for the superimposed ligands.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>For example, an initial screening of the CDK-2 kinase receptor used 1hck as the docking site, the co-crystallized ligand for which is ATP. Other known co-crystallized complexes include 1aq1, 1di8, 1dm2, 1fvt, and 1fvv. Superimposing these five complexes onto 1hck using all C<span class="Symbol">a</span> atoms in common revealed that at least four of the five ligands (all active binders) cannot fit into the 1hck site because its active-site channel is too short. The reason is that ATP and a Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion bound to its terminal phosphate group pull glutamate and lysine sidechains more deeply into the 1hck cavity, where they form an ion pair that closes off the cleft. Based on this visual examination, the 1dm2 site was chosen instead. This site is considerably more open than the 1hck site, though somewhat less so than the 1aq1 or 1fvv sites. Glide was far more successful in docking the known binders into the 1dm2 site than into 1hck, and was even more successful when the still more open 1aq1 site was used.</p>
