        <h1 class="title">Monitor Panel</h1><a name="summary"></a>
        <p>The <span class="GUI">Monitor</span> panel can be used to manage and monitor the progress of any Schrödinger computational job.</p>
        <p class="opening">To open this panel, choose <span class="GUI">Window → Job Monitor</span></p>
        <h2><a name="using"></a>Using the Monitor Panel</h2>
        <p>The <span class="GUI">Monitor</span> panel is used for showing information on jobs, monitoring the progress of jobs, and managing jobs. The information is obtained from your jobs database. You can use the <span class="GUI">Monitor</span> panel to monitor all your jobs, regardless of whether they were started from Maestro or not.</p>
        <p>Only one job can be monitored at any given time. To monitor a job, double-click it in the table in the <span class="GUI">Jobs</span> tab. The table row is colored blue, and the <span class="GUI">File</span> tab is placed on top, so you can see the log file. The display is updated as the log file changes.</p>
        <p>Monitoring a job is necessary for the job to be incorporated under the following circumstances:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">If you have selected <span class="GUI">Only when monitored</span> in the <span class="GUI">Jobs → Incorporation</span> tab of the <span class="GUI">Preferences</span> panel (this is the default).</li>
            <li value="2">If you have selected <span class="GUI">When approved</span> in the <span class="GUI">Jobs → Incorporation</span> tab of the <span class="GUI">Preferences</span> panel and you choose not to incorporate a job when prompted.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Most jobs write information to a log file as the job progresses. This file is copied back periodically to the job submission directory, and is available to the <span class="GUI">Monitor</span> panel. Some jobs copy back other files periodically, and these files can also be monitored. Some jobs (notably  MacroModel) do structural monitoring, and the current structure is displayed in the Workspace as a scratch entry, and is updated while the job is being monitored.</p>
        <p>When a job from the current project that is being monitored finishes, the results are automatically incorporated into the project using the settings that were active when the job was started. Once incorporation is complete the newly incorporated entries are selected in the project and the first of these is included in the Workspace. The job can then be removed from the list of jobs with the <span class="GUI">Delete</span> button on the monitor panel. However, if the job was submitted to a host that supports detached jobs (i.e. the launch host can go offline while the job runs), the job is not incorporated, but a download icon is displayed in the <span class="GUI">Status</span> column.<br class="image" /><img src="../Resources/Images/Toolbuttons/download_job.png" /><br class="image" />Clicking the icon downloads and incorporates the job.</p>
        <p>Incorporation can be undone. Undoing incorporation removes the new entries from the project and restores the Workspace to the state it was in just before monitoring mode was entered.</p>
        <p>Most Maestro operations stop the monitoring of a job. You can resume or begin monitoring a job at any time by selecting it from the list of jobs in the <span class="GUI">Monitor</span> panel.</p>
        <p>Panels that do not have a <span class="GUI">Job</span> toolbar, such as the <span class="GUI">Prime – Structure Prediction</span> and<span class="GUI"> Phase – Develop Pharmacophore Model</span> panels, have a button that indicates whether a job is running. The icon rotates when the job is running, and stops rotating when the job has finished. For these panels, the <span class="GUI">Monitor</span> panel can be opened by clicking the button.</p>
        <h2><a name="features"></a>Monitor Panel Features</h2>
        <p>The <span class="GUI">Monitor</span> panel has a jobs table and two tabs. Below the table is a set of action buttons that can be applied to jobs.</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1"><a href="#feature1">Jobs table</a>
            </li>
            <li value="2"><a href="#feature1.2"><span class="GUI">Show</span> option menu</a>
            </li>
            <li value="3"><a href="#feature4">Action buttons</a>
            </li>
            <li value="4"><a href="#feature2"><span class="GUI">Details</span> tab</a>
            </li>
            <li value="5"><a href="#feature3"><span class="GUI">File</span> tab</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4><a name="feature1"></a>Jobs table</h4>
        <p>The jobs table lists jobs started by the current user, using a tree format. The job information is taken from the job database for the user. This information is updated periodically.</p>
        <p>To monitor a job, select the table row and click <span class="GUI">Monitor</span>, or double-click the table row. The table row is highlighted in blue,and the <span class="GUI">File</span> tab is placed on top with the log file displayed.</p>
        <p>You can select multiple rows in the table with the usual shift-click and control-click actions, or you can select all rows by using the shortcut menu. If you select multiple rows, the <span class="GUI">Details</span> and <span class="GUI">File</span> tabs and the <span class="GUI">Monitor</span> button are unavailable. You can apply an action to the selected jobs with the other action buttons. The actions are also available from the shortcut menu. You can also show and hide subjobs, using the "turner" in the parent job row.</p>
        <p>You can sort the table rows by clicking in the heading of the column whose values you want to sort by. Subjobs are sorted in chronological order by default. Subjobs are kept under the parent job during sorting, so the top-level jobs are sorted by the column values, then for each job, the subjobs are sorted. You can also show and hide subjobs by clicking the "turner" for the parent.</p>
        <p>The table cells have tooltips, which are displayed when you pause the pointer over the cell. The tooltips display the full content of the cell, except for the <span class="GUI">Status</span> column, where an informative message describing the meaning of the status is displayed, and the <span class="GUI">Host</span> column, where the host entry name from the hosts file is displayed.</p>

The <span class="GUI">Files</span> table lists all files associated with the job except for the structure files. When you select a file in the table, the file is displayed in the <span class="GUI">File</span> tab. If you double-click a file, the <span class="GUI">File</span> tab is displayed with the selected file. By default, the log file is selected. Gray rows in the table mark files that are not available for viewing.</p>
        <p>The job record for the job is the last file in the list. This file shows details of the progress of the job and is useful for diagnosing errors.</p>
        <h4><a name="feature3"></a>File Tab</h4>
        <p>The <span class="GUI">File</span> tab displays the file that is selected in the <span class="GUI">Details</span> tab. By default, this file is the log file for the job. The display is updated at regular intervals. When new text is added, the display scrolls to show any new text if the display is already at the end of the file. If the display is not at the end of the file when text is added, the display remains at the same location in the file, and you must scroll down to the end of the file to see the new text.</p>
