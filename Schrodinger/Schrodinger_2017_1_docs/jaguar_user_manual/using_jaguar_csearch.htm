        <h1 class="Title">Conformational Searches with Jaguar and MacroModel</h1>
        <p>Jaguar and MacroModel can be combined into a very powerful tool for finding the preferred conformations of molecules. MacroModel is used to perform the search through conformational space to identify the lowest-energy conformations. Jaguar is then used to refine the geometries of the lowest-energy conformers. Redundant conformers can then be removed from the data set. </p>
        <p>When performing conformational searching of ligands, we recommend either the mixed torsional sampling/low-mode algorithm, or the ligand torsional search method (ConfGen). The former algorithm combines a random search of torsional space with an extensive following of low-mode eigenvectors on the potential energy surface to ensure good sampling of low-energy torsions. The ligand torsion search method does not use any random sampling and therefore avoids the problem of generating the same conformers repeatedly. This method analyzes the molecular structure to identify torsions which might have associated minima, and it generates all potential minimum-energy structures systematically. However, the quality of the conformers it produces is not high, and more work may be needed to correct the structures. See <a class="TopicLink MCXref xref xrefTopicLink" href="../macromodel_user_manual/mm_conf_search.htm#mm_conf_search_3329033292_59461" xrefformat="{paratext}">MacroModel Conformational Searches</a> for more information about conformational search methods. </p>
        <p>By default, each conformer that is found by the search algorithm is minimized using the selected force field. Some minimizations may not converge within the limit of minimization steps. This is not necessarily a problem, but if you want to ensure that you only use fully minimized structures as input to Jaguar, there are two ways to do it. The first is to simply increase the limit on the number of minimization steps while performing the conformational search. However, this can be expensive when large numbers of conformers are generated, because you will probably refine only a subset of these with Jaguar. If you expect the number of conformers to be large, the second approach is to decrease the limit on the number of minimization steps while performing the search so that it finishes quickly. After the search has finished and the results have been incorporated into the Project Table, you can select a subset of them and minimize them all using a MacroModel multiple minimization. At this point you would use a high limit on the number of minimization steps to ensure that all minimizations converge.</p>
        <p>After running the conformational search from Maestro, the results are incorporated into the Project Table, ranked so that the lowest-energy structures are uppermost. At this point you should examine the results and select an appropriate subset of conformers for refinement with Jaguar. Then choose <span class="GUI">Optimization</span> from the <span class="GUI">Jaguar</span> submenu of the <span class="GUI">Applications</span> menu. At the top of the <span class="GUI">Jaguar</span> panel, choose <span class="GUI">Selected entries</span> from the <span class="GUI">Use structures from</span> option menu. Jaguar’s default calculation settings, B3LYP/6-31G**, are appropriate for refining the structures of conformers, so at this point you can simply click the <span class="GUI">Start</span> button and launch your job. If the host or queue on which you want to run the job has as many CPUs available as there are conformers and you have sufficient license tokens, you can set the number of CPUs to the number of conformers. All conformers are optimized at the same time, on separate processors, for maximum efficiency. </p>
        <p>When the Jaguar optimization results are incorporated into the project, you can use the MacroModel redundant conformer elimination tool to remove any duplicate structures, in case some of the conformers that appeared to be different at the MM level were refined to the same structure at the QM level.
