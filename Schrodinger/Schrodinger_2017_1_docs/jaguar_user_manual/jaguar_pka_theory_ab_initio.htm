These single-point calculations are carried out at a significantly higher level of theory than the geometry optimization, but since only one energy is required, the overall cost of this step is less than that for geometry optimization. In recent publications, and in our own extensive unpublished work, the B3LYP method with large basis sets has been shown to yield excellent gas phase energetics for deprotonation reactions, with errors typically in the 1-3 kcal/mol range. We use the cc-pVTZ(+) basis set of Dunning and coworkers in the present methodology. The cc-pVTZ(+) basis set represents a mixed basis set where cc-pVTZ+ is used for atoms involved in the deprotonation reaction, while cc-pVTZ covers the rest. The residual errors in the DFT calculations appear to be relatively constant for a given functional group as the substituents are altered, and hence can be largely removed by the empirical corrections.</td>

        <p>As we have discussed extensively in several publications, empirical optimization of parameters is absolutely necessary to obtain accurate solvation free energies from SCRF calculation, no matter what the level of electron correlation. Continuum solvation methods do not rigorously treat effects at the dielectric boundary, which therefore must be adjusted to fit experiment.</p>
        <p>For neutral species, we have optimized parameters (both dielectric radii and surface tension terms) by fitting to experimental gas to water solvation free energy data for small molecules. Agreement to within a few tenths of a kcal/mole can be obtained for most functional groups. However, parameterization of the model for ionic species in this fashion cannot lead to high levels of accuracy, because there are large error bars on the experimental data (typically 5-10 kcal/mol). An error of 5 kcal/mol in the solvation free energy that was not systematic would lead to huge errors in p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> calculations. This is because in determining the p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> there is a cancellation of two very large terms: the gas phase deprotonation energy (which favors the protonated state) and the solvation free energy (which favors the deprotonated state). Errors in either term therefore can be a small percentage of the total energy but lead to very large errors in the resulting calculated p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub>.</p>
        <p>To overcome this problem, the parameters for ions are fitted <i>directly to experimental pK</i><sub class="SubItal">a</sub><i> data.</i> If the gas phase quantum chemistry and neutral solvation are reliably computed, then the solvation free energy of the ionic species becomes the remaining unknown quantity. Since p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> measurements are carried out to quite high precision (in contrast to direct measurements of ionic solvation), fitting to this data does not lead to the large uncertainties that would be associated with the ionic solvation data. Additionally, there is an exceptionally large database of known p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> values for a wide range of chemical functional groups. </p>
        <p>In general, the dielectric radii of ions (particularly negative ions) are expected to be smaller than that for the corresponding neutral species, due to the phenomenon of electrostriction. In our fitting procedure, the ionic radii are adjusted to yield the smoothest and most consistent results for the members of the training set for each functional group. For anions, special radii are assigned to the principal location of the negative charge; for cations, radii are assigned to hydrogens on the proton acceptor and to the proton acceptor itself. Functional groups for which radii have been developed are listed in <a class="Table_Number MCXref xref xrefTable_Number" href="jaguar_pka_training.htm#jaguar_pka_2514247352_1059887">Table 1</a>. For novel functional groups with divergent electronic properties, reparameterization of the model to a subset of experimental data is advisable, as the results are rather sensitive to these quantities. However, the current model is able to robustly handle substituent and conformational effects once a functional group is parameterized.</p>
        <p>In our work on neutral solvation, we have found that it is necessary to supplement parameterization of dielectric radii with surface area terms to correct for first shell hydrogen bonding. A purely electrostatic model is incapable, by itself, of properly describing such interactions for all molecules. For ions, these terms are expected to be even larger and more important, as the magnitude of the first shell hydrogen bonding interactions are 3-5 times larger than in neutral species. However, what we have done in the present model is to incorporate these corrections into our overall empirical fitting scheme, described below. In this fashion, all of the errors associated with the various components of the method are subsumed into a small number of parameters characteristic of the functional group in question.</p>
