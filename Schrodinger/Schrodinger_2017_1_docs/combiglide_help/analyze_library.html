        <h1 class="title">CombiGlide — Analyze Library Step</h1><a name="summary"></a>
        <p>In this step, the docking results are reduced to a small combinatorial library that contains the highest-scoring compounds. The reduction is achieved by filtering on various properties and by selection, and the final library is written out.</p>
        <h2><a name="using"></a>Using the Analyze Library Step</h2>
        <p>The goal of this step is to select a small set of reagents that is then used to create a combinatorial library, by applying various selection strategies, filtering, and manual selection. The purpose of this selection step is to create reagent lists that are small enough and well enough chosen for practical synthesis and screening of the resulting real combinatorial library.</p>
        <p>Selection and filtering is done in the <span class="GUI">Filter and Select</span> dialog box, which you open by clicking <span class="GUI">Filter and Select</span>. The selection strategies and the filters are described below. When you click <span class="GUI">OK</span> or <span class="GUI">Apply</span> in this dialog box, a job is run to perform the filtering and selection. At the end of the job, the tables are filled and you can examine the results. You can repeat the selection and filtering as many times as you like, save the results in the run, restore results from a previous selection, and compare results for different selections. When you are satisfied with a library, you can run a job to create and store the structures in the library, by clicking <span class="GUI">Create Library</span>.</p>
        <h3>Selection Strategies</h3>
        <p>CombiGlide has three automated selection strategies, which can be supplemented with manual selection. The automated strategies use the GlideScore to select the reagents that produce the greatest number of structures that have a good GlideScore, and are therefore likely to be active.</p>
        <p>The selection strategies work by filling lists of reagents at each position, until the limits on the minimum and maximum number of reagents and the overall library size are met. The molecules from the docking step are ordered according to their GlideScore or some derived quantity. Each molecule is considered in turn, and the reagents that were used at each position to build that molecule are added to the corresponding lists.</p>
        <p>The first strategy selects reagents based on the single side-chain docking. In this strategy, the lists for each position can be filled independently from the docking results for each position.</p>
        <p>The second strategy selects reagents based on the GlideScores from the combinatorial docking. In this strategy, reagents for each position are added from each molecule, unless they have already been added. As lists are filled, the remaining lists can be filled using molecules with reagents that are in the filled list, or using any molecule, regardless of whether the reagents are in the filled list. The first option ensures that all molecules used to create the library are in the library. This strategy ensures that the molecules in the library contain those with the best GlideScores.</p>
        <p>The third strategy uses the GlideScore from the combinatorial docking as a free energy, and calculates the normalized Boltzmann population for each docked molecule. The populations are summed for each reagent, and reagents are added to the lists in order of population, from highest to lowest. This strategy samples the most frequently occurring reagents, weighted according to GlideScore: reagents coming from molecules with good GlideScores are weighted more heavily than those with poor GlideScores.</p>
        <p>Finally, you can manually select reagents that must be included in the library or that must be excluded from the library, in the <span class="GUI">Include/Exclude</span> tab of the <span class="GUI">Filter and Select</span> dialog box. In addition, you can set the minimum and maximum number of reagents at each position, and set an overall library size, in the <span class="GUI">Selection Strategy</span> tab of the <span class="GUI">Filter and Select</span> dialog box.</p>
        <h3>Filtering</h3>
        <p>In addition to selecting reagents based on the GlideScore of the molecules that they are used to build, you can filter the combinatorial results based on various properties of druglike molecules. These properties are mostly generated by QikProp. Several filters are provided, and you can customize these filters by including or excluding any of the listed properties and by setting the limits on the acceptable range of properties. The filters are set up in the <span class="GUI">Filter</span> tab of the <span class="GUI">Filter and Select</span> dialog box.</p>
        <p>Filtering is not available unless you have a QikProp license.</p>
