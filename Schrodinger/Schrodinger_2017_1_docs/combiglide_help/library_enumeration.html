        <h1 class="title">Combinatorial Library Enumeration Panel</h1><a name="summary"></a>
        <p>This panel provides tools to develop a library of ligands from a core structure to which molecular fragments called <i>attachments</i> are added in user-specified positions. The attachments replace an existing group in the core structure.</p>
        <p class="opening">To open this panel, choose <span class="GUI">Tasks → Ligand Preparation and Library Design → Library Design → Combinatorial Enumeration</span> in the Task Tool.</p>
        <h2><a name="using"></a>Using the Combinatorial Library Enumeration Panel</h2>
        <p>The combinatorial library enumeration is carried out by substitution of attachments on the core structure with fragments from the reagent structures. For both the core and the reagents, the bonds to be broken must be designated. The fragments from the reagents are then attached to the core at the site of the broken bond. This process can be regarded as "growing" the new attachment onto the core in place of the old attachment, and the bond that is replaced (with its attached atoms) is called the <i>grow bond</i>. These bonds are not necessarily the bonds that are broken and formed in the real chemical reaction, but represent a means of varying the attachments to a core structure that might include part of the real reagent.</p>
        <p>To generate a combinatorial library, you must have a core structure whose attachments you want to replace, and a set of reagent files that define the replacements. For information on preparing reagent files, see the <a href="reagent_preparation.html">Reagent Preparation Panel</a> topic.</p>
        <p>When you first open the <span class="GUI">Combinatorial Library Enumeration</span> panel, <span class="GUI">Pick molecule</span> is selected in the <span class="GUI">Core structure</span> section, and most other controls are unavailable. After you have defined a core structure, the other controls become available.</p>
        <p><b>To define the core structure:</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>Ensure that the structure is displayed in the Workspace.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>Click on an atom in the core structure.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>After you pick the core structure, <span class="GUI">Pick molecule</span> is deselected, and the <span class="GUI">Pick</span> option is selected in the <span class="GUI">Pick to define an attachment</span> section. The core molecule is now defined, and you can define the positions of the attachments.</p>
        <p><b>To define an attachment:</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>Pick two atoms that define the position of one of the attachments, the atom that is kept first, then the atom that is deleted.</p> <p>A turquoise arrow is displayed over the bond, and the <span class="GUI">Select Reagent File</span> dialog box opens.</p></li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>Select the appropriate reagent file, and click OK</p> <p>The reagent files have a <code>.bld</code> extension: they are Maestro-format files that have special information for the Maestro builder, which does the library enumeration. The dialog box closes, and the attachment is listed in the <span class="GUI">Attachments</span> table. The size of the library with the current set of attachments is given in the lower portion of the panel. The arrowhead changes to a sphere and the color changes to gold.</p></li>
        </ol>
        <p>If you choose the wrong location for an attachment position, you can delete it by selecting it in the table and clicking <span class="GUI">Delete Attachment</span>. If you simply attached the wrong file, you can select the attachment in the table, and click the <span class="GUI">Browse</span> button below the table to select the correct file.</p>
        <p><b>To start the library enumeration job:</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>Choose <span class="GUI">Job Settings</span> from the <span class="GUI">Settings</span> button menu.</p> <img src="../Resources/Images/Toolbuttons/settings.png" /> <p>The <span class="GUI">Job Settings</span> dialog box is displayed.</p></li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>Change the output directory, if necessary, choose a host, set the job name, and click <span class="GUI">Run</span>.</p> <p>The host you choose should have temporary storage of about 3 to 4 times the size of the library. This space is required for the untangling and minimization of the library members.</p></li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>If you want to distribute the untangling and minimization, select a multiprocessor host, enter the number of subjobs in the <span class="GUI">Separate untangling into N subjobs</span> text box, and choose an option for distributing the subjobs. For good load balancing, each processor should run at least 3 subjobs.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>The job takes about 45-60 seconds per output structure, because each structure is minimized. The library is written to a Maestro file named <i>jobname</i><tt>.maegz</tt>.</p>
