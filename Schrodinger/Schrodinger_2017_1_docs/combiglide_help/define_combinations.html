        <p>In this step you select a molecule that is used as a "core" structure and choose the reagents that are used to vary the side chains of the core structure.</p>
        <h2><a name="using"></a>Using the Define Combinations Step</h2>
        <p>To perform combinatorial screening, you must have a core molecule whose side chains, or <i>attachments</i>, you want to replace, and a set of reagent files that define the replacements. For information on preparing reagent files, see the <a href="reagent_preparation.html">Reagent Preparation Panel</a> topic. The core structure must be a 3D, all-atom, properly minimized structure.</p>
        <p>When you first enter the <span class="GUI">Define Combinations</span> step, <span class="GUI">Pick molecule</span> is selected in the <span class="GUI">Core structure</span> section, and most other controls are unavailable. After you have defined a core structure, the other controls become available.</p>
        <p>Once you have defined a core structure and its attachments, click <span class="GUI">Next</span> to continue to the next step.</p>
        <p><b>To define the core structure:</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>Ensure that the structure is displayed in the Workspace.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>Click on an atom in the core structure.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>After you pick the core structure, <span class="GUI">Pick molecule</span> is deselected, and the <span class="GUI">Pick</span> option is selected in the <span class="GUI">Pick to define an attachment</span> section. The core molecule is now defined, and you can define the positions of the attachments.</p>
        <p><b>To define an attachment:</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>Pick two atoms in the core molecule that define the position of an attachment, the atom that is kept first, then the atom that is deleted.</p> <p>A turquoise arrow is displayed over the bond, and the <span class="GUI">Select Reagent File</span> dialog box opens.</p></li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>Select the appropriate reagent file, and click <span class="GUI">OK</span></p> <p>The reagent files have a <code>.bld</code> extension: they are Maestro-format files that have special information for the Maestro builder, which does the library enumeration. The dialog box closes, and the attachment is listed in the <span class="GUI">Attachments</span> table. The size of the library with the current set of attachments is given in the lower portion of the panel. The arrowhead changes to a sphere and the color changes to gold.</p></li>
        </ol>
        <p>If you choose the wrong location for an attachment, you can delete it by selecting it in the table and clicking <span class="GUI">Delete Attachment</span>. If you simply attached the wrong file, you can select the attachment in the table, and click the <span class="GUI">Browse</span> button below the table to select the correct file.</p>
        <p>For each attachment a <i>minimal capping group</i> is automatically defined. This minimal capping group is attached to the core at its attachment point in place of what is in the actual core structure when the core structure is docked. You can view the <i>minimally capped core</i> by selecting <span class="GUI">Minimally capped core</span> from the <span class="GUI">View as</span> options. To return to the original core structure, select <span class="GUI">User-capped core</span>.</p>

                <p>When selected, this option allows you to pick a molecule in the Workspace for the core structure. The molecule you pick should be a 3D, minimized structure. Picking a core molecule deletes any attachment data. This option is selected by default when you open the panel and no core molecule has been picked. After picking, the Workspace is cleared and the picked molecule is displayed. This molecule is copied into the CombiGlide run. Any changes you make to the <i>structure</i> of the molecule are not saved in the run. If you make changes to the structure, you must pick the molecule again to make it the core structure.</p>
