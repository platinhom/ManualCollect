        <h1 class="title">Combinatorial Screening Panel</h1><a name="summary"></a>
        <p>Create a small combinatorial library of compounds that should have high activity towards to a selected target. The library is screened, first by docking to the target receptor and eliminating compounds that do not dock well, then by analyzing the docked compounds to define a small reagent set that is likely to have a large number of actives among the compounds that are generated.</p>
        <p class="opening">To open this panel, choose <span class="GUI">Tasks → Ligand Preparation and Library Design → Library Design → Combinatorial Screening</span> in the Task Tool.</p>
        <h2><a name="using"></a>Using the Combinatorial Screening Panel</h2>
        <p>Each set of data defined in this panel is called a <i>run</i>. The data for each run is stored as a separate entity, which you can open from the <span class="GUI">File</span> menu. You can also import runs from this menu.</p>
        <p>The tasks involved in each step are summarized below.</p>
        <h3>The Define Combinations Step</h3>
        <p>In this step, you select the molecule that you want to use for generation of a library and screening the library by docking it to a receptor. The library is generated by replacing selected side chains in the molecule with other side chains. These side chains are called <i>attachments</i>. For each attachment, you identify the bond that defines where the substitution will take place, and specify a reagent library that contains the side chains you want to substitute. The bond is called the <i>grow bond</i>. The <i>core</i> of the molecule is the part of the molecule that is left when you remove the attachments. The library must be prepared beforehand (using the <a href="reagent_preparation.html"><span class="GUI">Reagent Preparation</span> panel</a>.</p>
        <p>Once you have selected a molecule and the attachment positions for the reagents, you can proceed to the next step.</p>
        <h3>The Configure Docking Step</h3>
        <p>The screening process uses Glide XP docking to filter out reagents that produce molecules that do not score well. This step assumes that you have already generated a Glide grid, using the <a href="../glide_help/receptor_grid_generation.html"><span class="GUI">Receptor Grid Generation</span> panel</a>. In this step, you set options for the docking of the libraries to the receptor. As well as selecting a grid and making basic settings as for a Glide run, you can specify the full range of Glide constraints for the docked molecules.</p>
        <p>After selecting a grid and setting any desired options, you can proceed to the next step.</p>
        <h3>The Define Core Poses Step</h3>
        <p>In this step, you select the core structures that you want to use in the docking step to define the core poses. These poses are generated by docking the molecules that contain the core. The molecule can be the core molecule, the <i>minimally capped core</i>, or some other molecule that you choose. The minimally capped core is the core of the molecule with a minimal attachment at each attachment position. In most cases, the minimal attachment is a methyl group. You can constrain the core position to prevent it from moving to regions of the receptor that would generate unacceptable binding modes.</p>
        <p>When you have selected or generated the core poses, you can proceed to the next step.</p>
        <h3>The Dock Library Step</h3>
        <p>In this step you run the jobs that generate the combinatorial libraries and run the docking jobs. The docking is performed in two passes. In the first pass, each attachment from each reagent library is added in turn to the core, to produce molecules with a single attachment and minimal capping groups at the remaining attachment points. These molecules are docked using Glide XP docking. Reagents that generate bad poses are eliminated. This pass can be run independently.</p>
        <p>In the second pass, the poses with a single attachment are combined intelligently to produce molecules that are likely to dock well. These molecules have attachments from the reagent libraries at all attachment points. This pass is the most time-consuming part.</p>
        <p>Once you have docked the combinatorial library, you can proceed to the next step. You can also export the results of either the single-position docking or the combinatorial docking for further examination.</p>
        <h3>The Analyze Library Step</h3>
        <p>In this step, the number of reagents used at each position is reduced to a small set by application of filtering and selection strategies. Filtering is based on structural properties such as molecular weight and counts of structural features, and on properties generated by QikProp. The selection strategies locate the "best" reagents at each position, based on the GlideScore of each of the docked structures.</p>
        <h2><a name="features"></a>Combinatorial Screening Panel Features</h2>
        <p>The <span class="GUI">Combinatorial Screening</span> panel is wizard-like in design, with five steps. Each step occupies the center of the panel, and consists of a title with a brief description of the step at the top, a set of controls and tables for results, and a <span class="GUI">Back</span> and a <span class="GUI">Next</span> button at the bottom. The features of each step are described in detail in separate help topics - see the <a href="#links">Related Topics</a> section below.</p>
        <p>In addition to the step features, the panel contains a menu bar and an job status button at the top, and a step guide at the bottom above the <span class="GUI">Close</span> and <span class="GUI">Help</span> buttons. These features are described below.</p>
