        <h1 class="title">CombiGlide — Dock Library Step</h1><a name="summary"></a>
        <p>In this step, you run the jobs that perform the library docking. You can also export the best reagents and the top structures to the Project Table or to a file.</p>
        <h2><a name="using"></a>Using the Dock Library Step</h2>
        <p>This step is the heart of the combinatorial screening process, where the docking jobs are performed to screen out reagents and molecules that do not dock well. The screening is performed in two stages. In the first stage, the attachments defined by the reagents are added, one at a time, to the minimally capped core. The resultant molecules, each of which has an attachment at a single position, are docked, and molecules that do not dock well are eliminated. The attachments added are taken from the expanded set of reagents, in which different ionization states, conformers, or tautomers can be represented.</p>
        <p>The reduced set of attachments for each position is then combined and scored with an intermediate scoring function, and the top scoring molecules with all attachments in place are then docked. This second stage can result in the elimination of further reagents.</p>
        <p>The two stages can be run in the same job, or run separately. The choice of how to run the stages is made in the <span class="GUI">Dock</span> dialog box, which opens when you click <span class="GUI">Dock</span>.</p>
        <p>As the processing of each set of reagents finishes, the results are posted in the <span class="GUI">Single position results</span> table. If QikProp is available, it is run for the completed structures, and the QikProp properties are added to the run.</p>
        <p>Once the results are available, you can add them to the Project Table or export them to a file. The structures from both stages are sorted by their GlideScores. Singly-substituted structures or completed structures are added to the Project Table as entry groups, with QikProp properties if these are available. For the singly-substituted structures, all poses from the selected number of reagents are exported.</p>
        <p><b>To add or export a set of singly-substituted structures:</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">Select the table row for the reagent type.</li>
            <li value="2">Enter the number of reagents in the <span class="GUI">Top <i>n</i> reagents</span> text box.</li>
            <li value="3">(Optional) If you want to include the receptor, select <span class="GUI">Include receptor</span>.</li>
            <li value="4">Click <span class="GUI">Add to Project Table</span> or <span class="GUI">Export</span>.</li>
            <li value="5">If you are exporting to a file, navigate to the directory, enter the file name, and click <span class="GUI">Export</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>To add or export a set of completed molecules:</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">Enter the number of structures in the <span class="GUI">Top <i>n</i> structures</span> text box.</li>
            <li value="2">(Optional) If you want to include the receptor, select <span class="GUI">Include receptor</span>.</li>
            <li value="3">Click <span class="GUI">Add to Project Table</span> or <span class="GUI">Export</span>.</li>
            <li value="4">If you are exporting to a file, navigate to the directory, enter the file name, and click <span class="GUI">Export</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If you have only one attachment, the normal workflow is not relevant because there are no combinations to be made. Instead, you can run an "enumerate and dock" job, in which the entire library is enumerated and docked.</p>

        <h3><a name="feature1"></a>Dock and Cancel Buttons</h3>
        <p>These buttons run or cancel the docking jobs that result in the combinatorial library. The <span class="GUI">Dock</span> button opens the <span class="GUI">Dock</span> dialog box, in which you can set up the type of docking job and select options for that job. Clicking <span class="GUI">Start</span> in the <span class="GUI">Dock</span> dialog box starts the job.</p>
        <p>The <span class="GUI">Cancel</span> button cancels the current docking job, on clicking <span class="GUI">OK</span> in a confirmation dialog box. If you are running the combinatorial docking job, and the single-positions job has already finished, the results of the single-positions job are retained.</p>
        <h3><a name="feature3"></a>Reagent retention table</h3>
        <p>This table presents statistics on the reagents that survive the various docking stages. The table is noneditable. You can select a single row for exporting reagents. The table columns are as follows:</p>
