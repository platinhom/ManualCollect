        <h1 class="title">WScore - Model Generation Panel</h1><a name="summary"></a>
        <p>Build a trained scoring model for docking to a particular protein target. The model uses an ensemble of protein structures (conformations) for the target, data from assessment of water thermodynamics from MD simulations (WaterMap), experimental binding affinities for known ligands (which form a training set), a test set of actives and a set of decoys to determine the enrichment of the training set and the test set. The scoring function includes penalties and interactions that are specific to the target.</p>
        <p class="opening">To open this panel, choose <span class="GUI">Tasks → Docking → WScore → Model Generation</span> in the Task Tool.</p>
        <h2><a name="using"></a>Using the WScore - Model Generation Panel</h2>
        <p>Prior to opening the panel, you should perform the following tasks:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>Select a set of complexes for the target of interest to use as a training set for the model. These complexes must have known binding affinities, and should represent conformations of a single protein.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>Prepare the complexes with the <span class="GUI">Protein Preparation Wizard</span>. You should do a full preparation, including fixing structural defects, prediction of het states for the ligand, Epik penalties, H-bond assignment, and minimization.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>Align the complexes with the <a href="../maestro_tools_help/align_binding_sites.html"><span class="GUI">Align Binding Sites</span> tool</a>. You should perform the alignment before you generate WaterMap data. If you want to use a pregenerated WaterMap for one of your complexes, you must align the remaining complexes to the receptor used for the WaterMap. If you want to pregenerate WaterMap data for your complexes, you must align them first. If  you have more than one WaterMap that you want to use and they are not aligned, you can use the script <code>rotate_all.py</code> to align them. For instructions run it with the <code>-h</code> option,</p><pre>$SCHRODINGER/run rotate_all.py -h</pre>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p>(Optional) Select a test set of known actives, and prepare them with <a href="../ligprep_help/ligprep.html"><span class="GUI">LigPrep</span></a>. Include the Epik state penalties. Ensure that these actives all have titles and that the titles are different for each active. The test set should be stored in a file, as it is read from file rather than taken from the project.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="5">
                <p>(Optional) If you want to use your own decoy set for the enrichment assessment, you should prepare them as you did for the test set.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>To set up and run the model generation job:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>Add the prepared and aligned complexes to the table. If the complexes are already in the project, select them in the Project Table and click <span class="GUI">From Project</span>; otherwise click <span class="GUI">From File</span>, and load the files. You can choose files with more than one complex; all complexes are read from each file. If the complexes have associated WaterMap data, it is read and added to the table; if not you can specify the location of the data or choose to have it generated automatically.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>Change the titles of the complexes if necessary. The title must be unique. If the complexes do not have titles, a unique title is supplied.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>Check that the ligand is correct for each complex. To do this, click the <span class="GUI">In</span> column for the complex. The complex is displayed in the Workspace, and markers are placed on the ligand. To change the ligand, click the ligand cell in the table, then pick the ligand in the Workspace, and click <span class="GUI">OK</span> in the dialog box that opens when you click the cell. You might have to change the ligand if the complex has more than one ligand-sized molecule (e.g. cofactors), as the first of these is the one that is chosen automatically.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p>Check that the binding free energies are correct for each complex. If not, you can edit the cell to provide the correct value. You must have a value for each complex to run the model generation.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="5">
                <p>If you want to include Epik state penalties, select <span class="GUI">Add Epik state penalties to docking score</span>.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="6">
                <p>Specify the test set of ligands. You need not provide a test set; if you do, click <span class="GUI">Browse</span> to navigate to the file you created in the preparation stage.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="7">
                <p>Choose the source of the decoy ligands. If you choose to use your own decoys, click <span class="GUI">Browse</span> to navigate to the file you created in the preparation stage.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="8">
                <p>Start the job.</p>
                <p>If this is the first time you have run a model generation job, click the Settings button (gear icon) and choose <span class="GUI">Run Settings</span>, then choose a host and number of processors for the job. The WaterMap jobs take about 2 days on 8 processors, so you should choose a multiprocessor host and specify an adequate number of processors. When you have finished making settings, click <span class="GUI">Save and Start</span> to save the settings and start the job.</p>
                <p>If you have already made appropriate job settings, click the <span class="GUI">Run</span> button.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>The results of the enrichment and the assessment of the quality of the model are available in the log file, which you can view in the <span class="GUI">Monitor</span> panel.</p>

—	Stop model generation if critical issues are detected. The two critical issues are poor RMSD values and poor scores. 	If you choose this option, a report is given on the issues found, so you can fix them and restart the model generation. If the fix involves structural changes, you should also regenerate the WaterMap. 	</li>
