        <h1 class="Title">Docking Covalently Bound Ligands</h1>
        <p>Docking of ligands that are bound to a receptor through hydrogen bonds or various other nonbonded interactions is relatively straightforward, and can be performed with high efficiency by Glide. When ligands bind covalently to the receptor, it is not as easy to screen ligands by docking, because the chemistry of the reaction of the ligand with the receptor must be accounted for. Covalent binding is usually considered to consist of an initial association, in which the ligand associates noncovalently with the protein in a pose that facilitates the reaction, followed by the reaction. The reaction is fast, so the binding is controlled by the access of the ligand to the binding site in a suitable pose. </p>
        <p>The Covalent Docking protocol addresses the process as follows. First, it determines whether ligands can associate with the receptor in a suitable pose. This is done by mutating the reactive residue on the receptor to alanine, so that the pose of the side chain does not unduly influence the association of the ligand, then docking the ligands with Glide, with constraints between the reactive residue and the reactive group on the ligand. Once suitable poses are found, the receptor is restored, and the poses of the side chain on the reactive residue are explored in the presence of the associated ligand, to find the best poses for reaction. The covalent bond is formed, and the ligand and reactive residue are minimized to relieve strain. The poses for a given ligand are clustered, and a representative pose is chosen from each cluster. These poses undergo a full minimization, and the representatives are ranked by their Prime energy. </p>
        <p>As the energy is not suitable for comparing different ligands, an affinity score is calculated, which measures the affinity of the ligand to the receptor for noncovalent binding prior to reaction. Ligands that do not score well are considered less likely to approach the receptor in a way that permits covalent bond formation. To calculate the score, the bond is broken again, the reactive receptor residue is mutated to alanine, and the bond to the ligand is capped with hydrogen. Scoring is then done in place with Glide, and the affinity is reported as the average of the pre-reacted and post-reacted GlideScore for a given pose. </p>
        <p>Covalent docking involves a reaction, which must be accounted for by the protocol, so that the reactive functional group on the ligand and the reactive residue are identified, and the bond formed between the correct atoms on each. The necessary information for several common reaction types are included with the protocol. </p>
        <p>The default Covalent Docking protocol is time-consuming, so it is not suitable for screening large numbers of ligands. Typically it takes 1–2 hours per ligand. A “virtual screening” protocol is also available, which skips time-consuming steps such as rotamer sampling and minimization. This protocol is at least 10 times faster than the default (“pose prediction”) protocol, and is suitable for screening thousands of ligands (with a limit of 10 000 in any run). </p>
