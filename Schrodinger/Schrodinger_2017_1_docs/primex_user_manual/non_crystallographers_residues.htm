        <h1 class="Title">Missing Residues in PrimeX</h1>
        <p>Crystallographers have three main ways of designating which residues are not well defined in the electron density. The least common practice is to set the B-factors of the atoms that are not observed to a very high value (80&#160;Å<sup>2</sup> or more) to indicate that that portion of the structure is disordered in some manner. Another method is to set the value of the occupancy for those atoms to zero. The occupancy is a quantity that ranges from 0 to 1 and specifies the fraction of the asymmetric units in the crystal in which an atom is present. However, the usual practice is to omit any atoms from the coordinate list for whose position essentially no information is observed in the electron density. This practice can be a problem for computational chemists since chemical information is usually available to show that those atoms are present, even if they are disordered and not observed in the electron density. </p>
        <p>If you wish to place missing atoms in the structure, first use the <span class="GUI">Protein Reports</span> panel (<span class="GUI">Tools</span> menu) to find them. Go to the site of a residue with missing atoms to see if you can rationalize the choice made by the original crystallographer. Compare the map contours for another similar side chain that is complete. To add the missing atoms, build that part of the structure using real-space loop refinement, followed by side chain placement. Both of these operations are available in the <span class="GUI">Real-Space Refinement</span> panel, which you open from the <span class="GUI">PrimeX</span> panel. More information on using these two tools is available in <a class="TopicLink MCXref xref xrefTopicLink" href="real_space.htm#real_space_3340644892_741933" xrefformat="{paratext}">Real-Space Refinement</a> and in the <a class="Manual MCXref xref xrefManual" href="../primex_quick_start/primex_quick_startTOC.htm#primex_quick_starttoc_2690561735_33054" xrefformat="{paratext}">PrimeX Quick Start Guide</a>. This is the more rigorous approach. </p>
        <p>If a single residue is missing atoms, you can right-click on the residue and use the <span class="GUI">Mutate</span> tool to replace the residue with the same residue again (this time with all atoms). To place the side chain into the electron density, right-click on the residue and select <span class="GUI">Rotamers</span>. In the <span class="GUI">Rotamers</span> dialog box, you can click <span class="GUI">Choose Best Fit</span> to allow the software to place the residue. Alternatively, you can step through the various common rotamers in the table to see which best fits the electron density. If you are not satisfied with any of these alternatives, you can use the <span class="GUI">Quick Torsion</span> tool (PrimeX toolbar) to adjust the side chain conformation.</p>
        <p>Water and other small molecules are probably correctly placed in your starting structure. Nevertheless, you should be aware of one error in a few crystal structures, where water is placed into electron density that belongs to part of the protein. Inappropriately-placed water molecules may interfere with placing missing atoms. Take care to examine the electron density at the sites where you are adding atoms to be sure that electron density for those atoms was not misinterpreted as bound water molecules. When building in one or more residues, any water molecules that might conflict with the new residue should be removed, and then replaced only after you are satisfied that they do not have unreasonably close contacts with newly-placed atoms.</p>
        <p>One other complication should be considered about protein crystal structures and placing new atoms in them. Although the coordinates for one unique set of atoms are displayed, because of the periodic nature of crystals these atoms are surrounded by symmetry-related copies. To interpret electron density on the surface of the protein, viewing the symmetry-related copies is often useful. To view symmetry-related atoms, choose <span class="GUI">Within 10Å</span> from the <span class="GUI">View Crystal Mates</span> toolbar button menu.</p>
