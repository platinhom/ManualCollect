        <h1 class="Title">The Protein Structure Alignment Panel</h1>
        <p>To open the <span class="GUI">Protein Structure Alignment</span> panel, choose <span class="GUI">Tasks → Structure Alignment → Protein Structure Alignment</span> in the Task Tool.</p>
        <p class="image">

        <p class="figure" data-mc-autonum="Figure 1:"><span class="autonumber"><span>Figure 1:</span></span>The Protein Structure Alignment panel. </p>
        <p>In the <span class="GUI">Protein Structure Alignment</span> panel, structure alignment is performed on Project Table entries that have been included in the Workspace or on the selected entries. You can choose which to use from the <span class="GUI">Use proteins from</span> option menu. If you choose <span class="GUI">Workspace (included entries)</span> the reference structure, whose frame of reference is used for the alignment, must be the first included entry (the entry with the lowest row number). To make another protein the reference, move that protein above all the other included entries in the Project Table. If you choose <span class="GUI">Project Table (selected entries)</span>, the reference structure must be the only structure included in the Workspace. </p>
        <p>By default, the alignment includes all residues. However, it is often useful to align a subset of residues that have greater similarity than the structures as a whole, or are more informative to compare. Because this program uses matching of secondary structure elements, the subset should have enough contiguous residues to include at least one helix or strand. Very small numbers of residues do not produce useful alignments.</p>
        <p>When the alignment calculation is complete, the structures are placed in the same frame of reference in the Workspace, and the results of the calculation are listed in the <span class="GUI">Protein Structure Alignment - Results</span> panel. The aligned residues are listed and an RMSD and Alignment Score are reported. The RMSD and alignment score are also added to the structures as Maestro properties, <span class="GUI">StructAlign RMSD</span> (<code>r_psp_StructAlign_RMSD</code>) and <span class="GUI">StructAlign Score</span> (<code>r_psp_StructAlign_Score</code>). The RMSD is calculated based only on those residues that are considered to have been successfully aligned, and therefore does not represent an overall comparison of the structures. It is computed from the C-alpha atoms of the aligned residues. An Alignment Score lower than 0.6–0.7 indicates a good alignment. Alignment Scores greater than about 0.7–0.8, or a failure of the structural alignment calculation, indicates there is insufficient structural similarity for a meaningful alignment. For details on the algorithm, see the paper by Honig and Yang (<i>J. Mol. Biol.</i> <b>2000</b>, <i>301</i>, 665). </p>
        <p>To run a default alignment job, include two or more protein structures in the Workspace, open the <span class="GUI">Protein Structure Alignment</span> panel, and click <span class="GUI">Align</span> to start the alignment calculation. </p>
        <p>The <span class="GUI">Protein Structure Alignment</span> panel provides some tools for controlling which parts of the protein are aligned and how they are aligned. These tools are described below.</p>
        <p>If you do not want to use all residues in the reference protein for the alignment, you can select the residues you want to use in the <span class="GUI">Reference residues</span> section, by using the picking tools. The remaining residues are ignored in the alignment.</p>
        <p>Alignment can be performed for all residues or for a subset of residues. There are two options: </p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p class="ListPara"><span class="GUI">Use same ASL as reference residues—</span>If you restricted the residues in the reference protein, select this option to use the same expression for the proteins to be aligned as for the reference. This does not necessarily mean the exact same residues (although it can), because the ASL expression is evaluated independently for each protein being aligned. </p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p class="ListPara"><span class="GUI">Use separate ASL</span>—Select this option to specify the subset with a different residue selection (ASL expression) from the reference, and use the picking tools to make the selection. You might need to try different subsets to obtain the most useful alignment. Subsets should include at least one secondary structure element (helix or strand). Clicking the <span class="GUI">Common objects </span>button then choosing <span class="GUI">Select</span> opens the <span class="GUI">Atom Selection</span> dialog box to the <span class="GUI">Residue</span> tab. Here you can select a range of residue numbers, specify portions of the residue sequence, or click <span class="GUI">Secondary Structure</span> in the list of options on the left to choose residues based on their location in Helix, Strand, or Loop structures. Subsets can be combined, intersected, or otherwise modified in the <span class="GUI">Atom Selection</span> dialog box.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>When the job starts, the <span class="GUI">Protein Structure Alignment Results</span> panel opens, displaying the text “Calculating alignment”. When the job finishes, the results are displayed and the structures are aligned. </p>
