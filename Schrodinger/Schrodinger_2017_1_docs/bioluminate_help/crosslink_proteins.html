        <p>Cross-link two protein chains with a peptide linker connecting the termini. The linker can be composed of several copies of a specified monomer unit. A loop prediction is performed on the linker to obtain a reasonable conformation.</p>
        <p class="opening">To open this panel, choose <span class="GUI">Tasks → Biologics → Crosslink Proteins</span> in the Task Tool.</p>
        <h2><a name="using"></a>Using the Crosslink Proteins Panel</h2>
        <p>This panel allows you to cross-link two pre-positioned proteins by connecting chain termini with peptide linkers. The link is formed with standard peptide bonds, so the links must be formed from the N-terminus of one chain to the C-terminus of another.</p>
        <p>The linkers are composed of monomer units. You can specify the entire linker as a monomer, you can create or read in shorter monomers and choose how many units are in each linker, or you can choose the standard amino acids as the monomers. If you choose to construct linkers from multiple monomer units, the monomer units in each linker are selected randomly. The number of linkers to construct can be specified explicitly or as a percentage of the possible variations. You can create linkers of different lengths, by specifying the range of numbers of monomer units in a linker.</p>
        <p>The chains are connected with each linker that is generated, and the strain energy for the linker is evaluated as the difference between the linker energy in the linked conformation and the minimum energy of the linker in the unbound conformation. The minimization could change the conformation of the free linker; however it is not guaranteed to be the global minimum.</p>
        <p>No adjustment of the relative position or orientation of the proteins is done in the process, so you must ensure that they are properly positioned before linking them—for example, if two proteins bind to a third and you want to link those two proteins, you may want to take their positioning from the complex with the third protein.</p>
        <p>Before you can add the linkers, you must ensure that the proteins are in a single project entry. If they are in different entries, you can create a project entry by clicking the <span class="GUI">Workspace</span> button on the <span class="GUI">Manager</span> toolbar to show the <span class="GUI">Workspace</span> toolbar, then click <span class="GUI">Create Entry</span>, and name the entry in the dialog box that opens.</p>
        <p>When you pick the termini, it can be useful to select them in the Workspace first. To do this, you can display the sequence viewer (<span class="GUI">Window → Sequence Viewer</span>), select the terminal residues in the sequence viewer, then choose <span class="GUI">A → Zoom</span> for the <span class="GUI">Selection</span> row in the <span class="GUI">Toggle Table</span> or click the <span class="GUI">Fit</span> button on the <span class="GUI">View</span> toolbar. The residues are marked with yellow selection markers, which will make them easy to pick.</p>

                <p>The strain energy is useful to score multiple possible crosslinking chains on a relative basis. Generally, chains with lower strain energies are better. Performing a search of multiple lengths and conformations and focusing on those crosslinks with the lower strain energies helps to select those candidates that are more likely to accommodate the connected domains in the starting conformation. However, note that the strain energy is only one component of the energy of the linked protein structure: it does not include the interaction energy between the linker and the protein, which can compensate for the strain.</p>
