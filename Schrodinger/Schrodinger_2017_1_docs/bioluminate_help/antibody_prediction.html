        <p>This panel provides a set of tools for prediction of the variable loop (CDR) region of an antibody. It includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Automated identification of the six CDR region loops based on sequence</li>
            <li value="2">Prediction of the loops using lookup tables and rules derived from an analysis of antibodies in the PDB (based on a new analysis from 2010)</li>
            <li value="3">Optional refinement of the loops where lookup is difficult, primarily for H3 and possibly H2.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="opening">To open this panel, choose <span class="GUI">Tasks → Biologics → Antibody Modeling → Prediction</span> in the Task Tool.</p>
        <h2><a name="using"></a>Using the Antibody Prediction Panel</h2>
        <p>The basic procedure for running a prediction using a homology model is as follows:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>Import the sequences for the light and heavy chains: Click the part of the diagram for the region you want to import, and choose a source from the list that is displayed.</p>
                <p>A dialog box is displayed, in which you can provide the sequence, either directly or from a structure. The diagram is colored for the loop that you choose once you have imported a sequence.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>Set up the antibody databases that you want to use to search for homologs for the framework region and the loops. Click <span class="GUI">Choose Databases</span> in the <span class="GUI">Framework Search</span> tab, add databases and select them in the table.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>Select <span class="GUI">Homology search</span> and run the homology search by clicking <span class="GUI">Search</span>.</p>
                <p>The results are listed in the table.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p>Select the homolog you want to use for the framework region, and click <span class="GUI">Accept</span>.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="5">
                <p>(Optional) In the <span class="GUI">Basic Loop Model</span> tab, select the loop cluster you want to use for each loop in the model by double-clicking in the <span class="GUI">Loop Template</span> table column for the loop, and choosing a cluster in the <span class="GUI">Loop Clusters</span> panel.</p>
                <p>By default a cluster is chosen automatically, based on similarity, then cluster size.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="6">

            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>The models are added to the Project Table.</p>
        <p>You can also use coordinates from existing structures instead of homology models, for example if you want to vary just one of the loops. The procedure is similar to that given above.</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>Import the sequences for the light and heavy chains: Click the part of the diagram for the region you want to import, and choose a source from the list that is displayed.</p>

            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>In many cases, the model based on homology is adequate, and no further prediction is needed. The H3 loop, however, is often difficult to predict, and may need more advanced refinement. Some general guidelines for when to refine a loop with Prime in the <span class="GUI">Advanced Loop Model</span> tab are given below:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p>If the loop is long (9 residues or more) and the homology is good (similarity above about 80%) then refinement with Prime is not usually necessary.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>If the loop sequence similarity is less than 40%, the basic model quality usually is very poor and a Prime refinement is recommended.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>The quality of the Prime refinement is greater for shorter loops.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p>When building a new H3 loop with new sequences on the native (crystal) structure of an antibody, Prime refinement is recommended.</p>
            </li>

There are very few templates, so you should be aware that the quality of the results in this region might be low. The model of the Fc region is built even if the sequence for this region is incomplete or missing, by using the template sequence.</p>
                        <p>You can import a structure to be used for the Fc region by clicking <span class="GUI">Import Fc Structure</span> and navigating to the file that contains the desired structure. The file must contain a full antibody structure, not just the Fc region. When the file is imported, it is added to the table and can be selected for use in the model.</p>

        <h3><a name="feature4"></a>Advanced Loop Model tab</h3>
        <p>In this tab you can run a more accurate and detailed loop prediction. These predictions can take hours for each loop. It is not usually necessary to run an advanced loop prediction for any of the loops except the H3 loop. The H3 loop is selected by default for an advanced prediction, as it is the hardest loop to predict. The results are returned to the Project Table as new structures.</p>
        <p>The input structure for the loop prediction is always the structure that came from the <span class="GUI">Basic Loop Model</span> tab. This means that you cannot do sequential loop predictions in this panel, but you can use the <a href="../prime_help/refine_loops.html"><span class="GUI">Refine Loops</span> panel</a> to predict more than one loop. However, it is expected that the main use of this tab is to predict a single loop.</p>
        <p>See <a href="#using">Using the Antibody Prediction panel</a> for general guidelines on refining a loop in this tab.</p>
