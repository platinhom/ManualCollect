        <h1 class="title">Antibody Humanization: Residue Mutation Panel</h1><a name="summary"></a>
        <p>This panel allows you to humanize an antibody by mutating residues to create a more human-compatible protein. Appropriate sites for mutation can be found by comparing the antibody to homologs and identifying residues that satisfy various criteria, such as solvent accessibility, maximum number of side-chain interactions with either the antigen or with the antibody itself.</p>
        <p class="opening">To open this panel, choose <span class="GUI">Tasks → Biologics → Humanization → Residue Mutation</span> in the Task Tool.</p>
        <h2><a name="using"></a>Using the Antibody Humanization: Residue Mutation Panel</h2>
        <p>The basic workflow in this panel is:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>Import a structure into the workflow, either from the Workspace or from a Maestro file (<span class="GUI">Import structure from</span>).</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>Select the chains to be treated as the "ligand".</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>Click <span class="GUI">Homology Criteria</span>.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p>(Optional) Choose the antibody databases that are used to search for homologs.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="5">
                <p>Run the search (<span class="GUI">Search Antibody Database for Homologs</span>) and align the homologs (<span class="GUI">Align Homologs</span>).</p>
            </li>
            <li value="6">
                <p>(Optional) Select an option for the chain to show, and examine the alignment for that chain.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="7">
                <p>Choose the regions that you want to substitute residues in.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="8">
                <p>Specify the criteria for automatic selection of residues, in the <span class="GUI">Selection by homology criteria</span> and <span class="GUI">Parent structure 3D criteria</span> sections.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="9">
                <p>Click <span class="GUI">Save</span>.</p> <p>The <span class="GUI">Homology Suggestions</span> dialog box closes, and the mutations identified from the homology model and the applied criteria are set in the residues table. The mutants are set to the variations seen in the homologs.</p></li>
            <li value="10">
                <p>Make any changes to the residues marked for mutation, by clicking in the <span class="GUI">Mutations</span> column of the table and selecting from the popup that is displayed. You can also use the tools above the table.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="11">
                <p>Choose the properties to calculate. <span class="GUI">Affinity</span> and <span class="GUI">pKa</span> are not selected by default as they take longer than the other properties.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="12">
                <p>Choose <span class="GUI">Job Settings</span> from the <span class="GUI">Settings</span> button menu,</p> <img src="../Resources/Images/Toolbuttons/settings.png" /> <p>set the job parameters in the <span class="GUI">Job Settings</span> dialog box, and click <span class="GUI">Run</span> to run the job.</p> <p>The mutated structures are incorporated into the project as new entries, and the <span class="GUI">Humanize Antibody Viewer</span> opens.</p></li>
        </ol>
        <p>Only one site is mutated at a time to produce a mutated structure: multiple simultaneous mutations are not performed. The number of structures is linear in both the number of sites mutated and the number of mutations at each site (it is in fact the sum of the number of mutations at each site). The number of mutation sites and the total number of mutations is reported below the table.</p>
        <p>If you want to perform mutations on other parts of the antibody, for example to mutate the antigen and the antibody at the same time, you can use the <a href="residue_scanning.html"><span class="GUI">Residue Scanning</span> panel</a>.</p>

        <p>The import tools allow you to import a protein structure into the workflow for residue mutation. You can choose an option from the <span class="GUI">Import structure from</span> option menu to use the entire structure in the Workspace, the selected residues in the Workspace, or a structure from a Maestro file. For the first two options, click the <span class="GUI">Import</span> button to import and analyze the structure.

Clicking <span class="GUI">Save</span> in this dialog box selects the suggested residues in the residue table of the <span class="GUI">Residues</span> tab and sets the mutations for the residue to the residues in the homologs that differ from the query.</p>

The pairs of chains that you consider to be identical must be chosen from the popup that appears when you click on the menu. This menu lists the pairs of chains with their percentage similarity. As chains that are formally identical can have small variations, this allows you to override these small variations (rather than requiring 100% similarity). It also allows you to mutate only some of the identical chains.</p>

scalar product of the normal to one surface at each surface point and the normal
to the other surface at the point nearest to the first surface, with a weighting 
factor for the distance between the points. The score is the normalized sum over
surface points, such that perfect complementarity (parallel normals) has a value
of 1, and no complementarity has a value of 0. It is evaluated over the buried
solvent-accessible surface area. (See Lawrence, M. C.; Colman, P. M. <i>J. Mol.
