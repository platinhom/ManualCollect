You can enter the path to the database in the <span class="GUI">Database file</span> text box, or click <span class="GUI">Open/Create</span> and navigate to the desired location, then choose an existing database file or enter the name for a new database. The database that you open is the database that is used for nonstandard residues in residue scanning.</p>
        <h3><a name="feature2"></a>Manage Database tab</h3>
        <p>In this tab you can manage the nonstandard residues in the chosen database: add new residues, provide name, code, description, select for inclusion in the menus that show lists of nonstandard residues.</p>

If you choose <span class="GUI">File</span>, click the <span class="GUI">Browse</span> button to locate the file and read in the residues. If you choose Workspace or Project Table, the included entries or the selected entries are added to the database when you click Import.</p>
                <p>A check is done as the residues are imported to detect duplicates. If a duplicate is found, a warning is posted, and you can choose to overwrite the existing residue with the imported residue, assign a new name to the imported residue by using the automatic naming scheme, or provide a new name for the imported residue.</p>

The first set is listed so that you can select them as templates for building new residues. The second set is listed both for selection as templates and for marking to appear on the list of residues to mutate to in application panels. The third set is the set that you add to the database. Note that only the third set is actually stored in the database; the first and second are stored in the installation and are presented in this table for easy access.</p>

                <p>The drawing area shows the structure and is used to build or edit structures. You can pan the view with the right mouse button, and rotate it with the middle mouse button. You can zoom in and out with the mouse wheel, and you can scroll the drawing area with the scroll bars. The area is large, so it is possible to place a number of structures in it.</p>
                <p>When the pointer is over an atom, it becomes the active atom, to which drawing operations are applied: bonding to a new carbon atom, changing element (by typing the element symbol), adding or replacing the functional group (by typing a group name or SMARTS string and pressing <span class="Keys">Enter</span>).</p>
                <p>When the pointer is over a bond and you are drawing with one of the three bond types, the bond becomes active. You can change it to a wedge or dashed bond, or increase the bond order, depending on the bond type.</p>
                <p>When a ring is selected, the ring is shown in blue. As you move the pointer in the drawing area, the ring "snaps" to positions that show a potential attachment of the ring to the structure.  Clicking when the ring is in one of these positions places the ring at that position, and its color changes to black.</p>
                <p>Right-clicking on an atom displays a shortcut menu that allows you to make settings for that atom:</p>
