        <h1 class="Title">Special Notes for the AMBER Force Field</h1>
        <p>AMBER94 does not differ from the published force field in any significant way. </p>
        <p>The MacroModel implementation of AMBER* is identical to original AMBER with the exception of additional parameters which we have added. We supply the field by default with a constant dielectric treatment, the united-atom AMBER charge set and Kollman’s 6,12-Lennard Jones hydrogen bonding treatment. Other options (e.g., distance dependent dielectric) may be set by modifying the first section of the AMBER force field file or via button selections from within MacroModel.</p>
        <p>The AMBER force field we supply has a special substructure notation, which allows a single residue substructure to match both united atom and all atom structures and assign the appropriate charges as well as other parameters. Although the linear notation gives only the united atom description of the molecule, the program will interpret the notation both as an actual united atom representation and as the all atom representation with the appropriate number of explicit hydrogens. The charges given for the residues are in the united atom representation for both the united atom and the all atom force field parameter sets. Thus, for the all atom charge set, the charges given are for the heavy atoms plus any attached hydrogens. To get the actual complete all atom charge set, the program uses dipoles from the main section of the field (mainly for heteroatom-H’s) or from the substructure (mainly for C-H’s).</p>
        <p>By using a combination of bond dipoles and formally united atom charges, MacroModel reproduces both AMBER field charges exactly and also provides reasonable charges for substituted or modified residues. As such, it allows the use either charge set (from the All atom or United atom paper) and, independently, hydrogens on carbons or united atoms. As we supply the field, the charges correspond to those given in the older AMBER paper (i.e., the united atom paper), but you may switch to charges from the newer paper (i.e., the all- atom paper) by modifying the ALT 1 line at the top of the force field file.</p>
        <p>You will notice that many of the parameters for some of the more complex amino acid sidechains (phenol, indole, imidazole, etc.) are given separately from the actual residue itself in the substructure section of the force field file. This allows any such substructure to be given the same parameter set as used in the actual amino acids. Thus indole itself gets the same parameter set as the indole of tryptophan. Such substructures are labeled as “C” (for Continue, see below) which means that the atoms matching the substructure may also be matched against substructures further down in the force field (i.e., where the actual residue might be found). The residues themselves are labeled “S” (for Stop). This means that once atoms are matched (as a complete residue), then they are removed from candidacy for matching with substructures which come below them in the field. This distinction speeds substructure matching since each such match of a “S” substructure removes atoms which must be tested from subsequent matching.</p>
        <h3 class="Heading3Nonum">Amber Torsional Specification</h3>
        <p>There are three differences between the MacroModel and the AMBER torsional parameters. These differences do not affect the actual functional forms used by the program, but only the way in which parameters are specified.</p>
        <p>First, AMBER uses a different entry for each 2-fold (<i>n</i>=2) and each 3-fold (<i>n</i>=3) barrier; MacroModel uses a single entry with both 2-fold (V<sub>2</sub>) and 3-fold (V<sub>3</sub>) barriers included. Second, AMBER uses only positive torsional potentials but uses an angular offset (<span class="Symbol">g</span>) to adjust the position of minima and maxima. For <span class="Symbol">g</span>=0° or <span class="Symbol">g</span>=180°, this is best accomplished in MacroModel through the use of positive and negative V<i>n</i> values, as follows.</p>
        <p class="Indented1">AMBER <i>n</i>=3, <span class="Symbol">g</span>= 0°: use V<sub>3</sub>/2 directly</p>
        <p class="Indented1">AMBER <i>n</i>=3, <span class="Symbol">g</span>=180°: use −V<sub>3</sub>/2 for V<sub>3</sub>/2</p>
        <p class="Indented1">AMBER <i>n</i>=2, <span class="Symbol">g</span>= 0: use −V<sub>2</sub>/2 for V<sub>2</sub>/2</p>
        <p class="Indented1">AMBER <i>n</i>=2, <span class="Symbol">g</span>=180: use V<sub>2</sub>/2 directly</p>
        <p>Some AMBER publications give torsional parameters as V<sub class="SubItal">n</sub>/2 and some as V<sub class="SubItal">n</sub>. In MacroModel force-field files, always use the V<sub class="SubItal">n</sub>/2 value.</p>
        <p>We also implement AMBER torsional offsets explicitly for arbitrary offsets; however, the implementation is not as efficient as that described in the preceding two paragraphs. Thus, for example, you may, in principle, specify an <i>n</i>=2 potential using a 180° offset by means of a positive value of V<sub class="SubItal">n</sub>/2 and an explicit value of 180°, but you are advised instead to use the formulation given above. On the other hand, for offsets equal to neither 0 nor 180°, there is really no choice but to use an explicit specification.</p>
        <p>To specify offsets explicitly for V<sub>1</sub>, V<sub>2</sub>, and V<sub>3</sub>, use a continuation force-field line beginning with <code>64</code> and place the offsets in the same columns as the V values for the main torsion line. Similarly, to specify offsets for V<sub>4</sub>, V<sub>5</sub>, and V<sub>6</sub>, use a continuation line beginning with <code>74</code> and insert the offsets in the same location. (Recall that V<sub>4</sub>, V<sub>5</sub>, and V<sub>6</sub> themselves use a continuation line beginning with <code>54</code>.) An offset specified as 0 is taken to mean “no offset specified,” so that if you wish to use a V<sub>2</sub> potential with a zero offset and a V<sub>3</sub> potential with a 31° offset, use a negative value of V<sub>2</sub>/2, as described above, on the first torsion line for this interaction; place the positive value of V<sub>3</sub>/2 on the same line. On a continuation line beginning with <code>64</code>, indicate a V<sub>2</sub> offset of zero and a V<sub>3</sub> offset of 31°.</p>
        <p>AMBER publications give total barriers for generalized torsional arrays—arrays with wild card atoms (the <code>X</code> atom type in AMBER publications) at positions 1 and 4. MacroModel, however, uses the MM2 method of storing only the component torsional barriers except in the substructure part of the field. Thus only generalized AMBER torsional barriers should be divided by the multiplicity of the torsional array where the multiplicity if equal to the number of substituents on the 2nd atom (excluding the 3rd atom) multiplied times the number of substituents on the 3rd atom (excluding the 2nd atom) in a torsional array of four atoms: 1-2-3-4. For the central bond of hexamethyl ethane for example, the multiplicity would be 3*3 or 9. For the peptide linkage, the multiplicity would be 2*2 or 4. Note that the multiplicity is computed based on the actual number of substituents so the multiplicity of a pair of united atom methylenes, e.g., <code>x - CB - CB - x</code> (MacroModel) or <code>X - C2 - C2 - X</code> (AMBER), would be only one since only single substituents (<code>X</code>) are attached to the methylene carbons. If you are confused, compare some of the entries in the MacroModel AMBER force field with those published in the AMBER papers. Remember that if a torsional array is described in AMBER publications without wild card <code>X</code> atoms, then the barriers are simply adjusted by sign as described above, but not divided by multiplicity. </p>
        <p>Regarding AMBER-style generalized torsions, MacroModel follows the AMBER protocol of not including the multiplicity for generalized torsions in substructures. only. Thus the substructure torsional barriers are the same as published in the AMBER papers if they are in the force field file in the form of <code>00</code> <i>nn</i> <i>nn</i> <code>00</code>, where <i>nn</i> is some atom number. The beginning and ending <code>00</code>’s are wildcard atom types.</p>
