        <h1 class="Title">Geometry or Transition-State Optimization Output</h1>
        <p>The output format description for optimizations in this subsection applies to calculations of either minimum-energy structures or transition states. Although the Hessians used during these calculations are different, the Jaguar programs run are the same, and the output format is very similar. (Exceptions are described below.)</p>
        <p>If you calculate an optimized molecular structure, a transition state, or forces, any SCF calculations during the run use the RMS density change convergence criterion described in <a class="TopicLink MCXref xref xrefTopicLink" href="../jaguar_user_manual/jaguar_options_scf.htm#jaguar_options_2333515368_22746" xrefformat="{paratext}">SCF Settings</a> instead of the usual energy convergence criterion. Therefore, these SCF calculations often proceed for several more iterations than single point energy calculations.</p>
        <p>If you select <span class="GUI">forces only</span> for the <span class="GUI">Optimize geometry</span> setting, the programs <code>der1a</code>, <code>rwr</code>, and <code>der1b</code> will run after <code>scf</code> does. The forces felt by each atom in the unoptimized geometry will be output from <code>der1b</code>, in a table listing each atom and the components of the force upon it in the x, y, and z directions. The x, y, and z components of the total force on the molecule are listed in the last line, and provide a judge of how accurate the force calculations are in most cases, since they should generally be zero. An example of this force table for a water molecule optimization follows:</p><pre>
  forces (hartrees/bohr) : total     
&#160;
 atom  label          x              y              z
 ----  -----   -------------  -------------  -------------
   1    O       0.000000E+00   0.000000E+00  -2.620407E-05
   2    H1      0.000000E+00  -6.462331E-05   1.291533E-04
   3    H2      0.000000E+00   6.462331E-05   1.291533E-04
 -----------   -------------  -------------  -------------
    total       0.000000E+00   0.000000E+00   2.321025E-04
</pre>
        <p>When force calculations or optimizations of a system’s minimum energy structure or transition state are performed at the LMP2 level, the program <code>der1b</code> never runs. Instead, forces are calculated by the programs <code>lmp2der</code>, <code>lmp2gda</code>, and <code>lmp2gdb</code>. The last of these programs provides a table of output listing the forces on each atom in the same format as the sample table above.</p>
        <p>For geometry optimizations, Jaguar prints bond length and angle information in the output from the program <code>pre</code>. If you have constrained bond lengths or angles of the geometry so that they are frozen during the optimization, as described in <a class="TopicLink MCXref xref xrefTopicLink" href="../jaguar_user_manual/jaguar_optmization_constraints.htm#jaguar_optimization_4029772162_20926" xrefformat="{paratext}">Constraining Coordinates in Jaguar Calculations</a>, the constraints are also listed in the <code>pre</code> output.</p>
        <p>At the end of the first SCF calculation, the programs <code>der1a</code>, <code>rwr</code>, and <code>der1b</code> run, calculating the forces felt by each atom in the unoptimized geometry and writing them to the output file, as described above.</p>
        <p>These force results are followed by the output from the program <code>geopt</code>, which includes a number indicating how many times it has been called, in the “start of program geopt” line. Every time <code>geopt</code> is called, this number is updated. However, since <code>geopt</code> can be called for Hessian refinement steps as well as for generating new geometries during an optimization, and since geometry optimizations occasionally revert back to a previous geometry and “restart” the calculation from there, the next line of the <code>geopt</code> output reports what sort of step is being performed and numbers that step accordingly.</p>
        <p>If the program detects that the input lists separate fragments, each of which contain only atoms unbonded to the atoms in any other fragment, as for a van der Waals complex, then the number of fragments is listed near the start of the <code>geopt</code> output.</p>
        <p>For transition-state optimizations, the eigenvalues of the nuclear Hessian are reported the first time <code>geopt</code> runs. If the initial Hessian is being refined, the coordinates for the refinement and their eigenvalues are listed. (If a coordinate you have specified is inappropriate because of symmetry restrictions or other constraints, the output will indicate the problem.) The <code>geopt</code> output then lists information on the current (original) geometry’s gradient elements, describes the small step it will use to alter the first coordinate used in the Hessian refinement, describes the internal coordinates and optimization variables as stretches, bends, or torsions, and indicates how it generates a new geometry by altering the relevant coordinate by the amount described by the step size.</p>
        <p>The new geometry generated for Hessian refinement is used to obtain energy and gradient information, which requires the programs <code>onee</code>, <code>grid</code>, and <code>rwr</code> to run and generate output in the usual formats. This is followed by output from the program <code>scf</code>, which now starts with the calculation type and the table showing the energy output from each SCF iteration (skipping the listed information about electrons, orbitals, and so on). The output continues with output in the usual formats from <code>der1a</code>, <code>rwr</code>, and <code>der1b</code>. The information obtained on that geometry is then used in <code>geopt</code>, which runs a second time, reporting similar information about the planned changes to the molecular structure for the next Hessian refinement step (if there is one) and reporting the change in total energy from the original geometry to the geometry for the first Hessian refinement step. This process of altering single coordinates from the original geometry and calculating energies and gradients for the changed geometry continues until all requested Hessian refinement steps have been performed, which the output indicates with a line beginning “Hessian optimization completed.” At that point, <code>geopt</code> performs a geometry optimization step from the original geometry, and the optimization continues until convergence.</p>
        <p>For transition-state optimizations, the output for iterations that follow any Hessian refinement includes information identifying the transition vector used for that iteration. This output includes the transition vector’s eigenvalue and the stretches, bends, or torsions that are its most important components.</p>
        <p>For any optimization iteration using level shifting, after any relevant lines of <code>geopt</code> output described above, some information on the computed level shift (which may then be adjusted to satisfy step-size constraints) is included in the output. For optimization steps past the first geometry change, the change in total energy from the previous geometry to the newly calculated geometry (in Hartrees) is listed next.</p>
        <p>The <code>geopt</code> output then lists the maximum element of the analytic gradient calculated by the earlier programs; the root mean square of the gradient elements; the step size predicted for the geometry change, the trust radius for that iteration and, if it is smaller than the step size, the factor used to scale the step size so it is no larger than the trust radius; the maximum element of nuclear displacement; and the root mean square element of the nuclear displacement. The predicted energy change for the new structure generated by <code>geopt</code> is also listed.</p>
        <p>The values for the energy change, gradient, and nuclear displacement described in the previous paragraph are important because they are each tested against the convergence criteria determined by the <span class="GUI">Convergence criteria</span> setting in the <span class="GUI">Optimization</span> tab, as described in <a class="TopicLink MCXref xref xrefTopicLink" href="../jaguar_user_manual/jaguar_optmization_basics.htm#jaguar_optimization_4029772162_92678" xrefformat="{paratext}">Jaguar Geometry Optimization: The Basics</a>, or, alternatively, the criteria set by the <span class="Keyword">gconv</span> keywords in the input file. The criteria are described in detail in <a class="TopicLink MCXref xref xrefTopicLink" href="jaguar_input_gen_geopt.htm#jaguar_input_1430212170_643409" xrefformat="{paratext}">Geometry Optimization and Transition-State Keywords in the Jaguar Input File</a>. If the gradients are converged and the energy change is below 2.5 x 10<sup>−7</sup>, the optimization stops (unless it is on the first geometry optimization iteration). Similarly, if the gradients are converged and one of the gradient criteria is 5 times lower than the convergence level, then the optimization stops if the energy change is less than 2.5 x 10<sup>−6</sup>.</p>
        <p>The symbol following each quantity used to judge convergence indicates how well converged it is. The symbol “.” indicates convergence criteria that are not satisfied, “*” indicates criteria that are satisfied, “#” indicates criteria that are quite well satisfied, “!” indicates values that are essentially zero. If the convergence criteria mentioned are not met, and if the maximum number of iterations has not been exceeded, the output notes “molecular structure not yet converged...” and the optimization continues.</p>
        <p>The output next lists the movement of the center of mass. If the output option for the bond length and angles is enabled, the output then lists this information for the new structure. Finally, the nuclear repulsion energy for the new geometry is listed.</p>
        <p>If the molecular structure was not yet converged and the maximum number of geometry optimization iterations allowed was not reached in the previous iteration, the output from more geometry optimization iterations follow. The output from each iteration begins with <code>onee</code>, <code>grid</code>, and <code>rwr</code> output in the usual formats, and continues with output from <code>scf</code>, which now starts with the calculation type and the energy output from each SCF iteration (skipping the listed information about electrons, orbitals, and so on). The output further continues with output in the usual formats from <code>der1a</code>, <code>rwr</code>, and <code>der1b</code>, winding up with the output from <code>geopt</code>. The last such geometry optimization iteration contains, in the <code>geopt</code> output, either the line, “Geometry optimization complete,” or the line, “stopping optimization: maximum number of iterations reached,” depending on whether the convergence criteria were met before the maximum number of iterations was reached.</p>
