        <p>In this panel you can set up a Phase 3D QSAR model from a set of aligned ligands, and use the model to predict activities for other molecules. You can also visualize the QSAR model in the Workspace, add the QSAR model to a hypothesis, and create a scatter plot of the activities.</p>

        <h3><a name="feature3b"></a>Delete and Delete All buttons</h3>
        <p>These buttons allow you to delete ligands from the ligands table. The <span class="GUI">Delete</span> button deletes the selected ligands from the table. This allows you to change a model by removing ligands, or replacing ligands, for example. The <span class="GUI">Delete All</span> button removes all ligands from the table. This is useful if you want to create a model with a different set of ligands.</p>
        <h3><a name="feature3"></a>Ligands table</h3>
        <p>This table contains the list of ligands. When the ligands are first read, all ligands are included in the training set, and the <span class="GUI"># Factors</span> and <span class="GUI">Predicted Activity</span> columns are empty. These columns are added after the QSAR model is built. The table columns are described below.</p>
        <p>Most of the columns of this table are noneditable. You can change the activity values, select the training and test sets, and display the ligands in the Workspace. You can sort the table by the values in a column, by clicking the column heading. Use shift-click and control-click to select multiple rows.</p>
