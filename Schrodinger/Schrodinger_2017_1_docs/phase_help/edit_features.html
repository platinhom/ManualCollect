        <p>The <span class="GUI">Edit Features</span> dialog box allows you to change the content of pharmacophore features. Features are defined in terms of SMARTS patterns. You can add patterns to both built-in features and up to three custom features. You can edit and delete custom patterns, and you can exclude or ignore both built-in and custom patterns in a feature.</p>
        <p>To open this dialog box, click <span class="GUI">Edit Features</span> in the <span class="GUI">Hypothesis Settings</span> dialog box.</p>

        </ul>
        <h3><a name="EditFeatures3.1"></a>Loading Feature Sets</h3>
        <p>The built-in feature sets are stored with the distribution. You can reload them by clicking <span class="GUI">Reset All</span>. This button also clears the custom sets.</p>
        <p>You can import a feature set from a file by clicking <span class="GUI">Import from File</span>, and navigating to the feature file. Feature sets can be saved to a file by clicking <span class="GUI">Export</span>, and specifying the file location in the file selector that is displayed.</p>
        <p>You can import a feature set from a hypothesis in the project by clicking <span class="GUI">Import from Entry</span>, and selecting the desired project entry in the dialog box that is displayed.</p>
        <p>The patterns that define a feature set are displayed in the <span class="GUI">Pattern list</span> table when you choose the feature from the <span class="GUI">Feature</span> option menu.</p>
        <h3><a name="EditFeatures3.2"></a>Adding Custom Features</h3>
        <p>Phase supplies six built-in features. You can augment these features with new patterns but you cannot delete them. If these features do not meet your requirements, you can create up to three custom features. These features have the one-letter code X, Y, or Z. To create a custom feature, click <span class="GUI">Add Custom Feature</span>. A dialog box opens, in which you can name the feature. When you click <span class="GUI">OK</span>, the feature is added to the feature menu and selected, so that you can add SMARTS patterns to define the feature.</p>
        <h3><a name="EditFeatures3.3"></a>Using Projected Points</h3>
        <p>By default, donors and acceptors are represented by vectors originating at the donor (hydrogen) or acceptor atom. The alignment of these vectors is used to determine whether ligands share the associated feature. Sometimes, two active ligands can form a hydrogen bond to the same receptor site, but from different directions. With the default representation, these two ligands would not contribute to the same pharmacophore hypothesis.</p>
        <p>You can replace the vectors with points at a specified distance from the ligand donor or acceptor atom. These points simulate the corresponding acceptor or donor in the receptor, and are called <i>projected points</i>. To use projected points, select <span class="GUI">Projected points only</span>. To use the same distance for all patterns, enter a distance in angstroms in the <span class="GUI">Distance</span> text box, and click <span class="GUI">Set Distances</span>. To set a distance for an individual pattern, edit the value in the <span class="GUI">Distance</span> column of the <span class="GUI">Pattern list</span> table for the pattern.</p>
        <p>When you select <span class="GUI">Projected points only</span>, only the patterns that have a vector geometry and a defined projected point type contribute to the feature. All other patterns that are not excluded are ignored. Vector alignments are not used because the vectors have been replaced by points.</p>
        <h3><a name="EditFeatures3.4"></a>Adding and Editing Custom Patterns</h3>
        <p>If the patterns in a given feature do not cover all the functional groups that you want to include in the feature, you can add extra patterns. To add a new SMARTS pattern, click <span class="GUI">New</span>. In the <a href="new_pattern.html"><span class="GUI">New Pattern</span> dialog box</a>, you can enter a SMARTS pattern and choose the geometry - whether it represents a group, such as an aromatic ring, a single point, such as an atom, or a vector, such as a hydrogen bond acceptor or donor - and the projected point type - whether it has a direction or orientation associated with it, such as aromatic ring orientation or lone-pair direction. Once you have added a custom pattern, you can edit it with the <span class="GUI">Edit</span> button or delete it with the <span class="GUI">Delete</span> button.</p>
        <p>If the SMARTS pattern you want to add is similar to an existing pattern, you can select the pattern, then right-click and choose <span class="GUI">Duplicate Pattern</span> from the shortcut menu. The pattern is duplicated as a new custom pattern. You can then click <span class="GUI">Edit</span> to edit the pattern. The <a href="edit_pattern.html"><span class="GUI">Edit Pattern</span> dialog box</a> has the same features as the <span class="GUI">New Pattern</span> dialog box.</p>
        <h3><a name="EditFeatures3.5"></a>Setting the Status of Patterns</h3>
        <p>Matching of patterns to ligand structures is done in the order specified in the <span class="GUI">Pattern list</span> table. If you have added custom patterns, you can move them up and down the list with the arrow buttons below the list, to set their priority. You cannot change the order of the built-in patterns.</p>
        <p>If you want to exclude functional groups represented by a pattern from the feature, you can select the check box in the <span class="GUI">Exclude</span> column for the pattern. For example, you might want to exclude a carboxylic acid group from being considered as a hydrogen bond donor, because it will be ionized under physiological conditions.</p>
        <p>If you want a pattern to be ignored, you can select the check box in the <span class="GUI">Ignore</span> column. Ignored patterns are equivalent to deleted patterns. If you want to save a custom pattern for later use, but not use it in the current feature, select the check box in the <span class="GUI">Ignore</span> column.</p>
        <h3><a name="EditFeatures3.6"></a>Visualizing Patterns</h3>
        <p>If you want to see a patterns for a given ligand or group of ligands, you can display the ligands in the Workspace from the <span class="GUI">Entry List</span>, and select the check box in the <span class="GUI">Mark</span> column (of the <span class="GUI">Edit Features</span> dialog box) for the pattern in the pattern list. Any occurrences of the pattern are marked in the ligand structures.</p>
        <p>You can display markers for more than one pattern, but the markers do not distinguish between patterns.</p>
