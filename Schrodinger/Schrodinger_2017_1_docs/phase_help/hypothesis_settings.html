 The descriptions below include all features for all workflows, and are grouped and labeled by workflow.</p>
        <h3><a name="feature1"></a>Features tab</h3>
        <p>In this tab you can adjust the hypothesis and feature criteria that are used for constructing a hypothesis. Most of these are only present when multiple ligands are used to create the pharmacophore model.

                        <p>Specify the percentage of the actives that should match the hypothesis. The number of hypotheses found decreases as you increase the percentage. As it is possible that actives bind in different modes, a specific hypothesis might not cover all of the actives. For example, a receptor might have a donor with two hydrogens, and one active binds through one hydrogen, another binds through the other hydrogen.

To determine whether two hypotheses of the same composition (e.g. ADHRR) are the same, they are aligned in every possible configuration. The maximum distance between any two corresponding sites is determined for each configuration. If the smallest value of the maximum distance in any configuration is less than the value specified in this text box, the hypotheses are considered to be the same (redundant). The hypothesis with the best survival score is kept and the other is discarded. If they are not redundant, the new hypothesis is inserted in the ranked list of hypotheses. </p>

                        <p>Excluded volume spheres are not placed on receptor atoms that are more than the specified distance from any ligand atom other than hydrogen. The outside surface of the excluded volumes is therefore approximately this distance from the ligand surface (depending on the excluded volume radii). Placing spheres further away than the first shell of receptor atoms is not generally useful, as ligands will be eliminated due to occupying some volume in the first shell. In addition, the time taken to evaluate occupation of excluded volumes scales with the number of spheres. </p>
