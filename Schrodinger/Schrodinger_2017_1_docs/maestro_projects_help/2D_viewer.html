        <h1 class="title">2D Viewer Panel</h1><a name="summary"></a>
        <p>The 2D viewer allows you to display 2D structures for entries in the Project Table, in a rectangular grid, and use them to select and include structures.</p>
        <p class="opening">To open this panel, choose <span class="GUI">Window → 2D Viewer</span></p>
        <h2><a name="using"></a>Using the 2D Viewer Panel</h2>
        <p>The basic function of the <span class="GUI">2D Viewer</span> panel is to display 2D representations of the structures in the Project Table and provide capabilities for selecting and including the entries from this panel.</p>
        <p>The 2D structures are images that are created when the panel is opened, or when you click <span class="GUI">Update</span> to update the panel contents from the Project Table. Images are not created for proteins or other large structures, but if a protein has a ligand, the ligand structure is drawn, and an icon is displayed in the top right corner to indicate that the structure contains a protein. The images can be exported in various formats.</p>
        <p>In addition to the structures, properties can be displayed below the structures in each cell. Real properties are displayed to the same precision as in the Project Table. You can also display an atom-level property, such as the atom name, instead of the atomic symbol. To select properties to display, choose <span class="GUI">Edit → Select Properties</span>.</p>
        <p>Each cell in the display area corresponds to an entry in the Project Table. You can select cells with the usual shift-click and control-click actions, and you can drag to select cells.With a single cell selected, you can step through the structures with the arrow buttons or with the N and P keys on the keyboard.</p>
        <p>The selection is independent of the selection in the Project Table by default, but you can make the panel selection and the Project Table selection the same by selecting <span class="GUI">Synchronize selection with Project Table</span>.</p>
        <p>The inclusion state is always the same as in the Project Table, and is indicated by the square in the top left of each cell. You can automatically include in the Workspace the structures that you select in the panel by selecting <span class="GUI">Include selection in Workspace</span>. With this option, whenever you select a table cell, the structure is included in the Workspace.</p>
