        <h1 class="Title">Specifying Placement and Distribution in the Disordered Mixture</h1>
        <p>The next stage is to specify how the molecules are to be placed and distributed in the box or in relation to the substrate. The molecules are placed initially in the box, and then undergo up to three processes to produce a final placement. </p>
        <p>If you are not using a substrate, there are two options for the initial state, <span class="GUI">Snapped to grid</span> and <span class="GUI">Amorphous</span>. If you are using a substrate, only the <span class="GUI">Amorphous</span> option is available. The <span class="GUI">Snapped to grid</span> option places randomly chosen molecules on a regular grid in the cubic box, in such a way that there are no clashes for any possible rotation of the molecules. This option tends to generate systems that are closer to cubic than the <span class="GUI">Amorphous</span> option. The <span class="GUI">Amorphous</span> option places randomly chosen molecules at random locations and orientations in the box, or in the substrate if it is a container type, or around the substrate if it is to be immersed. </p>
        <p>The processes that can be applied to modify the initial state of the system, in order of their application, are as follows. You can choose any combination of these processes.</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p class="ListPara"><span class="GUI">Monte Carlo simulated annealing</span>—Perform a Metropolis Monte Carlo simulated annealing calculation to minimize the energy of the system. The weights and sizes of translation and rotation moves, the temperatures, the number of iterations, and the energy terms to use can be set in the <span class="GUI">Simulated Annealing Options</span> dialog box, which you open by clicking the <span class="GUI">Options</span> button. </p>
                <p class="ListPara">There are two choices for the energy terms: a force field, which you can select, or a “gravity” term, whose energy is negative and linear in the distance between the nearest atom of a molecule to a substrate atom, or to the cell center if there is no substrate. The two terms can be combined.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p class="ListPara"><span class="GUI">Steric pack</span>—Maximize the density of the system by moving the molecules towards the substrate (if one is defined) or the center of the cell, while avoiding steric clashes. Options for the van der Waals scaling (for defining clashes), the initial density, the property to keep constant, and the number of attempts at placement are available in the <span class="GUI">Disorder Options</span> dialog box, which you open by clicking the <span class="GUI">Disorder Options</span> button at the lower right of the panel.</p>
                <p class="ListPara">Once the molecules are distributed in the cell, starting at the center or the surface and moving outward or upward, each molecule is moved toward the origin along the vector between the molecular center and the origin. The point closest to the origin that causes no steric collisions is the new location of the molecule. No rotation is performed and no other movement is performed. Molecules are allowed to pass through each other to find the closest-to-the-origin cavity along the vector. Atoms are considered hard spheres and any overlap is considered a steric collision. </p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p class="ListPara"><span class="GUI">Minimization</span>—Minimize the final configuration of the structure using the specified force field. Click the <span class="GUI">Force Field</span> button to specify the force field to use. The current force field is reported to the left of the button. </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Several other options are available in the <span class="GUI">Disorder Options</span> dialog box, including setting a random seed, randomizing the orientations of molecules when snapped to a grid, coloring molecules by component rather than the default coloring by element, setting limits on the number of placement attempts for each molecule and the number of attempts to build a more densely packed cell in the steric packing process.</p>
        <p>After the initial placement and any procedures applied to produce a final location for each molecule, the unit cell is redefined to produce the densest fit to the final disordered system, while remaining orthorhombic.</p>
