        <h1 class="Title">Bond and Ligand Dissociation Energies</h1>
        <p>When evaluating compounds for their reactivity or stability, it can be useful to know what the bond energies are. This information may be useful in the assessment of chemical lifetimes of optoelectronic materials, for example. Similarly, when evaluating ligands for use in transition metal complexes, the ligand binding energy can help to determine the usefulness of the ligand. </p>
        <p>The Materials Science suite provides a workflow that evaluates the change in energy for dissociating molecules into all possible combinations of two fragments that come from breaking covalent single non-ring bonds (by homolytic dissociation) or from removing ligands from a metal atom. This workflow is available from the <span class="GUI">Bond and Ligand Dissociation </span>panel, which you can open by choosing <span class="GUI">Tasks → Quantum Mechanics → Bond and Ligand Dissociation</span> in theTask Tool.</p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="bond_dissociation_energy.png" style="margin: 2px;" />
        </p>
        <p>Dissociation energy calculations can be performed on multiple molecules in the same run. You can choose the source of the structures from the <span class="GUI">Use structures from</span> option menu:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p class="ListPara"><span class="GUI">Project Table (selected entries)</span>—Use the entries that are currently selected in the Project Table.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p class="ListPara"><span class="GUI">Workspace (included entries)</span>—Use the entries that are currently included in the Workspace, treated as separate structures.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p class="ListPara"><span class="GUI">File</span>—Use the structures from the specified file. When this option is selected, the <span class="GUI">File name</span> text box and <span class="GUI">Browse</span> button are activated. Click <span class="GUI">Browse</span> and navigate to the file you want to use. The file name is displayed in the text box when you click <span class="GUI">Open</span> in the file selector. You can also enter the file name in the text box.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can calculate both bond dissociation and ligand dissociation energies in the same run. To choose the kinds of dissociation to be considered, choose one or both of the <span class="GUI">Dissociation Site </span>options:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p class="ListPara"><span class="GUI">Single, acyclic bonds</span> —Calculate dissociation energies for the breaking of all single bonds in each molecule that are not part of a ring. </p>
                <p class="ListPara">By default, bonds to hydrogen are not included. If you want to consider bonds to hydrogen as well, choose <span class="GUI">Include bonds to hydrogen</span> from the option menu. If you want to consider only bonds to hydrogen, to calculate hydrogen abstraction energies, choose <span class="GUI">Include only bonds to hydrogen</span> from the option menu. </p>
                <p class="ListPara">You can include or exclude bonds to other atoms by selecting the <span class="GUI">Include only bonds to atoms that match one of these SMARTS patterns</span> or <span class="GUI">Exclude bonds to atoms that match one of these SMARTS patterns</span> options and providing the SMARTS patterns in the text boxes. You can include multiple SMARTS patterns, separated by spaces, in each text box. Any bond that has an atom that matches any of the SMARTS patterns is either included or excluded.</p>
                <p class="ListPara">If the molecule is a metal complex, bonds between monodentate ligands and the metal are included as well as bonds within the ligands. </p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p class="ListPara"><span class="GUI">Ligands complexed to metals</span>—Calculate dissociation energies for the removal of single ligand molecules that are complexed to metals. This may involve the breaking of more than one metal-ligand bond, if the ligand is polydentate. </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The input molecules that you provide must be closed-shell singlet molecules. This includes transition-metal complexes. However, you can choose from a variety of initial states that are actually used in the calculations, and you can perform the calculations for more than one initial state, by choosing from the <span class="GUI">Initial reactant state</span> options:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p class="ListPara"><span class="GUI">Singlet ground state</span>—Calculate dissociation energies from the ground state of the input molecule, which must be a closed-shell singlet. </p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p class="ListPara"><span class="GUI">Lowest triplet state</span>—Calculate the dissociation energies from the lowest triplet state of the input molecule. For bond dissociation, the fragments are always treated as doublets.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p class="ListPara"><span class="GUI">Radical anion</span>—Calculate dissociation energies from the negative ion doublet state. As the negative charge can be on either of the fragments, both the neutral and the charged fragments are calculated. The output from this case is two reactions, rather than just one. </p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p class="ListPara"><span class="GUI">Radical cation</span>—Calculate dissociation energies from the positive ion doublet state. As the positive charge can be on either of the fragments, both the neutral and the charged fragments are calculated. The output from this case is two reactions, rather than just one. </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The calculations are performed with Jaguar, and the geometry is optimized for all fragments and all input states. To maximize efficiency, a unique set of fragments for the entire input is assembled, and calculations are performed on the unique fragments. This means, for example, that if a phenyl ring occurs in more than one place either within a single molecule or in different molecules, only one calculation is performed on the phenyl ring. Likewise, dissociation from a singlet and a triplet state produce the same set of fragments, so the cost of calculating both is not much more than that of calculating one of the initial states. (The extra cost is just the cost of the extra initial states). </p>
        <p>By default, the calculations are run in the gas phase. To run the calculations in solution, click <span class="GUI">Choose</span> to set the solvent. The <span class="GUI">Solvent Model</span> dialog box opens, where you can select the PBF solvent model and choose a solvent. The other controls in this dialog box are the same as in the <span class="GUI">Solvation</span> tab of the <span class="GUI">Jaguar</span> panel—see <a class="TopicLink MCXref xref xrefTopicLink" href="../jaguar_user_manual/jaguar_options_solvation.htm#jaguar_options_2333515368_24251">Jaguar Solvation Settings</a>. </p>
        <p>If you want to add keywords for the Jaguar calculations, you can do so in the <span class="GUI">Keywords</span> text box. A default set of keywords is provided for the method and basis set as well as some accuracy and convergence settings. </p>
        <p>In the output structure file, there is an entry for each reaction, which contains the reactant and product structures for that reaction, as well as the reaction energy property. The reactant structure is placed on the negative side of the <i>x</i> axis, with the broken bond highlighted and placed along the <i>x</i> axis. The product structures are placed on the positive side of the <i>x</i> axis, and displaced in the <i>y</i> direction so they don't overlap. They have the same orientation as in the reactant structure (unless the same fragment is used for multiple reactions). The atoms on the end of each broken bond are highlighted in the product structures. For polydentate ligands, each atom that ligates the metal is marked, and each metal-ligand bond is marked in the reactant.The average of the vectors defined by the broken bonds in the reactant is aligned on the <i>x</i> axis.</p>
        <p>In addition to the entries for the reactions, there are entries for each reactant molecule and each product molecule. The product titles contain an index for the fragment and the job name. </p>
