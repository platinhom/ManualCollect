<p><u><center>Initial Size and Position of View Windows</center></u></p>
<p>The initial size and position of a new View Window is determined by the size and position of the most recently active View Window, either from the current GaussView instance or the previous GaussView instance.  If the most recently active View Window is still open, the new View Window will be slightly offset from it so both View Window's title bars are visible.</p>
