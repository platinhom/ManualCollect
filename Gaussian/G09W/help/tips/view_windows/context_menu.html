<p><u><center>Context Menu for View Windows</center></u></p>
<p><b>Right-clicking</b> in a View Window will pop up a context menu containing each of the Main Window's menu bar and toolbar items.  This is especially useful when the View Window is full screen or when you have many windows open and the Main Window is obscured.</p>
