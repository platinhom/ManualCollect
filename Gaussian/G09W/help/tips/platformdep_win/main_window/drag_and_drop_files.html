<p><u><center>Dragging and Dropping Files Onto the Main GaussView Window</center></u></p>
<p>On a Windows system, you can open one or more files in GaussView by dragging them
 from a Windows explorer window or other Windows location and dropping them onto the GaussView
 main window.  If you drag and drop the files with the left mouse button, a separate new molecule group
 will be created for each file.  If you you drag and drop the files with the right mouse button, you get
 a menu of options when you drop of how you want the files to be opened (e.g, create a separate new
 molecule group for each file, create a single new molecule group for all files, etc.)
