<p><u><center>Dragging and Dropping Files Onto View Windows</center></u></p>
<p>On a Windows system, you can open one or more files in GaussView by dragging them
 from a Windows explorer window or other Windows location and dropping them onto a GaussView
 view window.  If you drag and drop the files with the left mouse button, the files will be 
 added to the view window's molecule group.  If you you drag and drop the files
 with the right mouse button, you get a menu of options when you drop of how you want the files
 to be opened (e.g, create a separate new molecule group for each file, create a single new molecule group
 for all files, etc.)
