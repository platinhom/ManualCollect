				<p class="less-so-heading-1">All About Selections: From Atoms to Fragments, Residues, Chains and Beyond</p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">GaussView has a wide variety of different methods and techniques for selecting atoms within molecular structures. Groups of selected atoms are used for many purposes in building structures and setting up Gaussian jobs. This section will discuss the various alternatives, which are summarized in the following list:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="common-bullet-ns">Selection-related toolbar icons: <span class="items-in-text-button-in-text">Select by Clicking</span>, <span class="items-in-text-button-in-text">Select by Marquee</span>, <span class="items-in-text-button-in-text">Select All</span> and <span class="items-in-text-button-in-text">Select None</span></li>
					<li class="common-bullet-ns">View window selection keystrokes</li>
					<li class="common-bullet-ns">Selecting with the <span class="items-in-text-dialog-names">Atom List Editor</span>, the <span class="items-in-text-dialog-names">PDB Residue Editor</span>, and the <span class="items-in-text-dialog-names">PDB Secondary Structures Editor</span></li>
					<li class="common-bullet-ns">Using the <span class="items-in-text-dialog-names">Atom Group Editor</span></li>
					<li class="common-bullet-full-space">The <span class="items-in-text-dialog-names">Atom Selection Editor</span> </li>
				</ul>
				<p class="less-so-heading-2">Selection-Related Toolbar Icons</p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph"><img src="web_pix/i_pick_click.jpg" alt="i_pick_click.tif" /> <img src="web_pix/i_pick_marquee.jpg" alt="i_pick_marquee.tif" />The main window builder toolbar and the standalone <span class="items-in-text-dialog-names">Builder</span> palette both contain icons which control item selection behavior and place the cursor in a dedicated selection mode. The icon on the left sets the selection mode to clicking: clicking on an atom toggles its selection mode. Selected atoms appear light yellow (see the two leftmost atoms in the illustration at the right), and their serial numbers are displayed. Contrast this to highlighting where atoms are displayed in light blue for easy identification and/or location (e.g., the hydrogen atom at the lower right). If an atom is both selected and highlighted, it appears light blue (highlighted).</p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">			    <img src="web_pix/w_picked.jpg" alt="w_picked.tif" /></p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">The other selection mode is marquee mode, also called rubberband mode (the icon on the right at the head of this paragraph). In this mode, pressing and holding the mouse button while dragging the cursor will draw a rectangle in the view. When the mouse button is released, all atoms within the defined area are added to the selection. Variations to this default functioning for both modes are available via the <span class="items-in-text-dialog-names">Atom Selection</span> dialog discussed below.</p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph"><img src="web_pix/i_select_all.jpg" alt="i_select_all.tif" /> <img src="web_pix/i_select_none.jpg" alt="i_select_none.tif" />The other two selection-related icons are the <span class="items-in-text-button-in-text">Select All</span> and <span class="items-in-text-button-in-text">Select None</span> buttons, which select and deselect all atoms in the molecule, respectively.</p>
				<p class="less-so-heading-3"><a name="keys" id="keys"></a>Selection Keystrokes in View Windows</p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">These same selection options are available at all times in any View window via the following keystrokes, regardless of the current toolbar icon selection:</p>
				<table border="1" bordercolor="#006699">
					<tbody>

				<p class="less-so-heading-2"><a name="select1" id="select1"></a>Selecting with the Atom List Editor and Similar Tools</p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">The <span class="items-in-text-dialog-names">Atom List Editor</span> is discussed in more detail in the next section of this book, but a mention of its selection facilities are relevant here. This dialog, illustrated in Figure 29, provides a spreadsheet-like mechanism for viewing and modifying molecular structures and parameters. The same facilities are also provided by the <span class="items-in-text-dialog-names">PDB Residue Editor</span> and <span class="items-in-text-dialog-names">PDB Secondary Structure Editor</span>. There are three main features:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="common-bullet-full-space">All of these tools have the ability to highlight various parts/substructures of the molecule, controlled via the <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Highlight</span> column. Highlighted atoms can be selected and deselected via the <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Select/Deselect Highlighted Atoms</span> items on the <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">View</span> menu in the Atom List Editor and the similar <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Select/Deselect Highlighted Residues</span> and <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Select/Deselect Highlighted Secondary Structures</span> items in the <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">View</span> menus of the other tools. </li>
					<li class="common-bullet-full-space">The <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Rows</span> menus of these three tools all contain the <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Select Atoms of Selected Rows</span> item. Choosing it will cause all atoms corresponding to selected rows in the spreadsheet to be added to the current selection.</li>
					<li class="common-bullet-full-space">The <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Invert Selection</span> and <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Select All </span>items on the <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Rows</span> menus modify the selection to include all unselected atoms and to include all atoms, respectively.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">Somewhat similar functionality is also present in the <span class="items-in-text-dialog-names">ONIOM Layer Editor</span> discussed later, although this facility’s purpose is substantially more specialized.</p>
				<p class="less-so-heading-2"><a name="age" id="age"></a>Using the Atom Group Editor</p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">The <span class="items-in-text-dialog-names">Atom Group Editor</span>, reached via the <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Atoms Groups</span> item on the main <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Edit</span> menu, allows you to define subgroups of atoms within a structure for various purposes. It is illustrated in Figure 26.</p>
				<p class="common-figure"><img src="web_pix/ed_frags.jpg" alt="ed_frags.tif" /></p>
				<p class="less-so-figtitle">Figure 26. The Atom Group Editor</p>
				<p class="less-so-caption">This dialog is used to define fragments and other atoms groups for various types of Gaussian jobs. A separate charge and spin can be optionally assigned to each fragment (as we are doing here). The Atom Group Class popup lists the various kinds of atom groups for which GaussView provides special handling. The Persistent Visuals causes the settings of the Highlight and Display columns to continue to be honored in the View window even after the dialog is closed.</p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">The various columns in the spreadsheet hold the following data. <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Group ID</span> holds a name for each atom group, typically the class names with a number. When the checkbox in the <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Highlight</span> column is checked, the atoms in the corresponding group are encircled with the indicated highlight color. The menus in the <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Display</span> column allows you to hide the atoms belonging to one or more groups. The <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Atom Tags</span> field lists the serial numbers of the atoms in each group. You can define groups by entering atom numbers here directly, and the field is also updated when atoms are added to or removed from groups by other methods. The <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Atom Count </span>column lists the number of atoms in the group and the <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Electrons</span> column lists the number of electrons (both are read-only). The <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Charge</span>, <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Spin Mult</span> and <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Unpaired Spins</span> columns may be used to set per-fragment charges and spin multiplicities (an example is described later). Finally, the plus and minus sign buttons in each row may be used to add or remove all currently selected atoms from the corresponding group.</p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">Once atom groups are defined, the <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Select Atoms</span> and <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Deselect Atoms</span> items on the <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Group Actions</span> menu can be used to select/deselect atoms within an atom group. The other items on this menu have the following uses:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="common-bullet-ns"><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">New Group</span>: Add another group of the current group class. For example, selecting this item in Figure 26 will add another Gaussian Fragment group.</li>
					<li class="common-bullet-ns"><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Remove &quot;</span><span class="items-in-text-italics">item</span><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">&quot;</span>: Removes the selected atom group. Any atoms in the group are assigned to the first group. </li>
					<li class="common-bullet-full-space"><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Add Selected Atoms to</span>/<span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Remove Selected Atoms from</span>: Equivalent to the plus and minus buttons in the <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Selected Atoms</span> column. </li>
				</ul>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">Note that this dialog serves to assign atoms to named groups. None of the items here have any effect on the structure or ever remove any atoms from the molecule.</p>
				<p class="common-keep">The defined classes of atom groups are as follows:</p>

				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">The <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Class Actions</span> menu allows you to create a new type of atom group, to reset the atom group assignments to the default (all in the first group), to remove an atom group class and to rename a class.</p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">There are two other important controls in this dialog:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="common-bullet-full-space">The <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Exclusive</span> checkbox causes each atom to belong to exactly one atom group. When checked, if an atom is placed into an atom group, it is removed from its present group automatically. It is required for all of the atom group types used for various Gaussian calculation types. It is off by default for the Gaussian Fragment class, but the setting sticks once you enable it.</li>
					<li class="common-bullet-full-space">The <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Persistent Visuals</span> checkbox controls whether the highlighting and show/hide display settings are retained in the View window when the <span class="items-in-text-dialog-names">Atom Group Editor</span> is closed. It is unchecked by default.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="less-so-heading-2"><a name="ase" id="ase"></a>The Atom Selection Editor</p>

				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">The <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Expand Selection</span> slider allows you to expand a selection to include atoms adjacent to already-selected ones.

The choice made here affect what atoms will be added to the selection as the slider is moved to the right, and the <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Up To</span> field indicates the maximum value corresponding to the right end of the slider: number of bonds, distance in Angstroms, number of residues. Thus, moving the slider all the way to the right when <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Up To</span> is 5 and <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Bond</span> is selected will select all atoms within 5 bonds of all currently selected atoms.
