				<p class="less-so-chapter">Opening, Displaying and Saving Molecules and Views</p>
				<p class="less-so-heading-1">Customizing and Manipulating Molecule Views</p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">GaussView contains a variety of controls and features for customizing the displays in View windows. These may be accessed via the <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">View</span> menu, and also via toolbar icons in some cases. The <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">View</span> menu may also be accessed by clicking the right mouse button in an open area of any View window or other molecule display.</p>
				<p class="less-so-heading-2"><a name="center" id="center"></a>Centering the Molecule</p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">The <span class="items-in-text-button-in-text">Center</span> button and the <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">View=&gt;Center</span> menu item centers and resizes the image in the active View window to make the most efficient use of the workspace.</p>
				<p class="less-so-heading-2"><a name="opt" id="opt"></a>Viewing Optional Display Items</p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">Several <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">View</span> menu options toggle the display of optional items within a View window:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="common-bullet-ns"><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">View=&gt;Hydrogens</span>: Display of hydrogen atoms in the View window (initially on).</li>
					<li class="common-bullet-ns"><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">View=&gt;Dummies</span>: Display of dummy atoms if present (initially on).</li>
					<li class="common-bullet-ns"><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">View=&gt;Labels</span>: Display numeric labels indicating atom sequence numbers (initially off). </li>
					<li class="common-bullet-ns"><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">View=&gt;Symbols</span>: Display the chemical symbol for each atom (initially off).</li>
					<li class="common-bullet-ns"><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">View=&gt;Bonds</span>: Display bonds between atoms (initially on). </li>
					<li class="common-bullet-ns"><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">View=&gt;Synchronize</span>: Coordinate mouse actions in synchronized views.</li>
					<li class="common-bullet-ns"><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">View=&gt;Cartesian Axes</span>: Display X,Y,Z axes (initially off). This feature is illustrated in Figure 49. Initially, the origin of the axes is in an arbitrary position (sometimes located on atom 1), and it remains fixed despite changes to the molecule. Use the <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Edit=&gt;Reorient</span> menu item to move the origin to the molecule’s current center of mass.</li>
					<li class="common-bullet-ns"><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">View=&gt;Stereochemistry</span>: Display the chirality of any chiral centers (initially off).</li>
					<li class="common-bullet-full-space"><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">View=&gt;Positioning Tools</span>: Open positioning toolbar in View window (initially off).</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">You can specify default values for these items via the <span class="items-in-text-dialog-names">General</span> panel of the <span class="items-in-text-dialog-names">Display Format</span> dialog (<span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">View</span> menu) or the <span class="items-in-text-dialog-names">Display Format</span> panel of the preferences. You can also exclude labels and symbols on hydrogen atoms or hydrogen and carbon atoms using the <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Exclude View Labels</span> and <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Exclude</span> <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">View Symbols</span> items in the <span class="items-in-text-dialog-names">Text</span> panel of the <span class="items-in-text-dialog-names">Display Format Preferences</span> (both default to excluding no atom types). Finally, the size of textual labels can be adjusted using the <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Size</span> field in the <span class="items-in-text-dialog-names">Text</span> panel of the <span class="items-in-text-dialog-names">Display Format Preferences</span>.</p>
				<p class="common-figure"><img src="web_pix/bld_reorient.jpg" alt="bld_reorient.tif" /></p>
				<p class="less-so-figtitle">Figure 49. Displaying Cartesian Axes</p>
				<p class="less-so-captionc">These windows illustrate GaussView’s Cartesian Axes display option. The window on the left shows the initial position of the axes (which is quite arbitrary), and the one on the right shows the origin’s new position after using the Edit=&gt;Reorient menu item.</p>
				<p class="less-so-heading-2"><a name="mpos" id="mpos"></a>Molecule Positioning Tools</p>
				<p class="common-keep">Figure 50 illustrates the molecule positioning toolbar, which is accessed with the <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">View=&gt;Positioning Tools</span> menu item.</p>
				<p class="common-figure"><img src="web_pix/toolbar_pos.jpg" alt="toolbar_pos.tif" /></p>
				<p class="less-so-figtitle">Figure 50. The Positioning Toolbar<br /></p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">For all of the tools, the view’s X, Y and Z directions are the horizontal, vertical and depth of the window, and the molecule X, Y and Z directions are those indicated by the Cartesian axes. The various controls are described individually below (moving across the toolbar from left to right):</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="common-bullet">The <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Quick</span> popup contains items which center the molecule in one or more view directions or align axes on the molecule with that of the view. For example, the <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Center</span> and <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Center X</span> items center the molecule within the window and with respect to the window’s X-axis (i.e., horizontally), while the <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Mol X -&gt; View Z</span> item aligns the molecule’s X-axis with the View window’s Z-axis. Other items work analogously.</li>
					<li class="common-bullet">The second popup menu indicates whether the molecule will be rotated or translated in order to perform the repositioning when the <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Apply</span> button is pushed. The next two fields also control the operation.</li>
					<li class="common-bullet">The <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Around</span> field specifies the axis about which the molecule will be rotated (active when the previous popup is set to <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Rotate</span>). When <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Translate</span> is selected in the initial field, then the label changes to <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Along</span>.</li>
					<li class="common-bullet">The <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">By</span> field specifies the amount of rotation or translation.</li>
					<li class="common-bullet-full-space">The final slider provides another way to specify the amount of movement. As you adjust the slider, the molecule moves immediately in the direction and manner specified by the first two fields (and the <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">By</span> field is ignored).</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="less-so-heading-2"><a name="p_display" id="p_display"></a>Molecule Display Formats</p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">The <span class="items-in-text-button-in-text">Display Format</span> button and the <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">View=&gt;Display Format</span> menu item both open the <span class="items-in-text-dialog-names">Display Format</span> dialog. Each panel in this dialog also has a twin within the <span class="items-in-text-dialog-names">Display Format Preferences</span>. We will consider the <span class="items-in-text-dialog-names">General</span>, <span class="items-in-text-dialog-names">Text</span> and <span class="items-in-text-dialog-names">Molecule</span> panels here and will consider the <span class="items-in-text-dialog-names">Surface</span> panel <a href="results.htm#p_dsurf">later</a> in this book.</p>
				<p class="less-so-heading-3"><a name="p_dgen" id="p_dgen"></a>The General Panel</p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">The items in the <span class="items-in-text-dialog-names">General</span> panel control molecule display quality, items displayed in the view (as mentioned above), and the fog feature. It is illustrated in Figure 51. </p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">The options in the top part of this panel govern how the molecule appears both when it is being moved in the View window by mouse action and when it is not moving. On slower systems, it can be often useful to set the slider more toward the <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Realistic</span> end of the scale for <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Stationary</span> <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Object Display</span> and more toward the <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Fast</span> end of the scale for <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Moving</span> <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Object Display</span>.</p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">The <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Smooth</span> checkboxes enable/disable smoothing in the display, and the <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Spotlight</span> checkboxes enable/disable simulated spotlighting on the window contents.</p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">You can change the View window background color by clicking on the color chip labeled <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Background Color</span>, and selecting a new color using the color selection dialog.</p>
				<p class="common-figure"><img src="web_pix/v_disp_gen.jpg" alt="v_disp_gen.tif" /></p>
				<p class="less-so-figtitle">Figure 51. Display Format General Panel<br /></p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">The <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Use Fog to Improve Depth Perception</span> checkbox causes more distant atoms in the View window to recede to invisible, allowing nearer atoms to become more distinct. The <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Fog has Zero Visibility at</span> field controls the depth at which atoms become completely invisible. </p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">This feature is illustrated in Figure 52. In this example, the lefthand illustration shows the molecule with the fog feature disabled. In the righthand illustration, fog is turned on, and the frontmost atoms are much more distinct than more distant ones.</p>
				<p class="common-figure"><img src="web_pix/v_fog.jpg" alt="v_fog.tif" /></p>
				<p class="less-so-figtitle">Figure 52. The Fog Depth Display Feature</p>
				<p class="less-so-captionc">Compare the display types between the two windows to understand the effect of fog.</p>
				<p class="less-so-heading-2"><a name="p_dmol" id="p_dmol"></a>The Molecule Panel</p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">The options in this panel control how atoms and bonds appear in the View window. The three popup menus specify how atoms in each of the three ONIOM layers will be displayed. If the ONIOM facility is not being used, then the setting for the <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">High Layer</span> is used. The <span class="items-in-text-dialog-names">Molecule</span> panel is shown in Figure 53. </p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">The layer display settings are also used by some other GaussView features unrelated to ONIOM (e.g., displaying atoms at the boundaries of PBC unit cells).</p>
				<p class="common-figure"><img src="web_pix/v_disp_mol.jpg" alt="v_disp_mol.tif" /></p>
				<p class="less-so-figtitle">Figure 53. The Display Format Molecule Panel</p>
				<p class="less-so-captionc">The various items in this panel control various aspects of molecule displays.</p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">The various supported display types are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="common-bullet"><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Ball &amp; Stick</span>: Molecule appears as a ball and stick model, with all types of bonds represented by <br />single sticks. This is the default.</li>
					<li class="common-bullet"><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Ball &amp; Bond Type</span>: Molecule appears as a ball and stick model with single bonds represented by single sticks, and multiple bonds represented by multiple sticks, or in the case of aromatic systems, by dotted lines. </li>
					<li class="common-bullet"><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Tube</span>: Molecule appears as a tube model with no indication as to bond type. Atom types are indicated by color bands on the tubes.</li>
					<li class="common-bullet"><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Wireframe</span>: Molecule appears as a series of thin lines, colored by atom type and indicating bond type via the number of lines.</li>
					<li class="common-bullet-full-space"><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">None</span>: Atoms are invisible (useful only with multilayer models).</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">The <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Use van der Waals Radii</span> checkbox and <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Scale Radii by</span> field cause the atoms in the View window to be displayed at the indicated scaling of the van der Waals covalent radii. Using a scaling value of 150%-200% will produce a space filling-like molecular display, as in Figure 54.</p>
				<p class="common-figure"><img src="web_pix/v_cpk.jpg" alt="v_cpk.tif" /></p>
				<p class="less-so-figtitle">Figure 54. A CPK-Like Display</p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">The <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Z-Clip</span> slider may be used to remove the frontmost portions of the image to allow views into the interior of the molecular display.</p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">The <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Use Bond Color</span> checkbox controls whether bonds are partially or entirely colored by atom type in the tube display format. The two options are illustrated in Figure 55.</p>
				<p class="common-figure"><img src="web_pix/v_tube.jpg" alt="v_tube.tif" /></p>

				<p class="less-so-heading-3"><a name="p_dtxt" id="p_dtxt"></a>The Text Panel</p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">The <span class="items-in-text-dialog-names">Text</span> panel of the <span class="items-in-text-dialog-names">Display Format</span> dialog controls the font and color of atom labels and symbols as well as allowing you to exclude certain atoms from labeling as previously mentioned. It is illustrated in Figure 56.</p>
				<p class="common-figure"><img src="web_pix/v_disp_txt.jpg" alt="v_disp_txt.tif" /></p>
				<p class="less-so-figtitle">Figure 56. The Text Panel of the Display Format Dialog</p>

				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">The <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Font File</span> menu allows you to select from several font files provided with GaussView. The <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Size</span> field specifies the relative type size: type resizes with the molecule as you zoom in or out. The <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Render</span> field specifies the type rendering method, and the <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Color</span> field specifies the type color. Note that font sizes are generally limited to those included on the <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Size</span> menu.</p>
				<p class="less-so-heading-2"><a name="p_colors" id="p_colors"></a>Customizing Display Colors</p>
				<p class="common-keep">The <span class="items-in-text-dialog-names">Colors Preferences</span> allow you to customize the coloring of View window backgrounds, atoms (elements), bonds, surfaces and vibration vector displays. The dialog is illustrated on the left in Figure 57.</p>
				<p class="common-figure"><img src="web_pix/pref_color.jpg" alt="pref_color.tif" /></p>
				<p class="less-so-figtitle">Figure 57. Customizing GaussView Colors</p>
				<p class="less-so-caption">The Colors preferences dialog appears on the left, and the Element Colors preferences appears on the right.</p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">The items in the <span class="items-in-text-dialog-names">Colors Preferences</span> dialog control the coloring of the following items:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="common-bullet"><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Background Color</span>: Background color in view windows. Click on the color chip to modify it.</li>
					<li class="common-bullet"><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Element Colors</span>: Element-based atom coloring. This button brings up a periodic table indicating the default color for each element (see Figure 57). Click on any element to change its default color.</li>
					<li class="common-bullet"><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Surface Colors</span>: Specifies colors for surfaces (discussed below).</li>
					<li class="common-bullet"><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Bond Colors</span>: Sets coloring for bonds in each of the various display types. The dialog is similar to the one in Figure 52, and it displays the selected color on a sphere. Don’t be confused by this; the selected colors will be used to color the bonds, not the atoms.</li>
					<li class="common-bullet-full-space"><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Vibration Colors</span>: Sets the coloring of the dipole derivative and displacement vectors in vibrations displays. Again, although the color selector is similar to the one in Figure 58, the color selected will be used to color the displayed vectors, not the atoms.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="less-so-heading-3">Specifying Colors </p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">The dialog in Figure 58 is used to specify coloring for single-color surfaces. For surfaces types having positive and negative lobes (phases), two colors are specified (as in the figure, which specifies colors for MO surfaces). The dialogs for other <span class="items-in-text-dialog-names">Colors Preferences</span> items are similar.</p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">The fields at the top of this example dialog allow you to select the surface type and display style (in dialog for other items, the appropriate items are substituted for these). The most important fields are located in the center of the dialog. The Scheme popup allows you to select the type of coloring that is applied to the object. The <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">1-Color Shaded</span>, <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">2-Color Shaded</span>,<span class="items-in-text-object-in-text"> 3-Color Shaded</span>, and <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">4-Color Shaded</span> items select gradient-filled coloring, consisting of shades of the indicated color (<span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">1-Color Shaded</span>) or blends between the specified colors (2 or more colors). Keep in mind that less is more with gradients when good taste prevails. The <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">1-Color Flat</span> colors the object using the specified color in a solid mode, without creating any illusion of three-dimensional shape.</p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">Clicking on any of the color chips in this area allows you to modify that color. Note that two-lobed surfaces will have two sets of color chip(s), placed on the left and right sides of the dialog. If the <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Use RGB Selector</span> checkbox is selected, then you can use the sliders below it to specify the RGB values for the desired color. If it is unchecked, then the system color selection utility will be invoked.</p>

				<p class="less-so-figtitle">Figure 58. Surface Coloring Preferences</p>
				<p class="less-so-captionc">This dialog allows you to customize the colors used for surfaces.</p>
				<p class="less-so-heading-2"><a name="addv" id="addv"></a>Adding and Synchronizing Views</p>
				<p class="common-keep"><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">View=&gt;Add View</span> menu item and the <span class="items-in-text-button-in-text">Add View</span> button may be used to add a new View window for the current model. This view is independently adjustable, and begins with the default settings (rather than those of the current View window). </p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">The <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">View=&gt;Synchronize</span> menu item can be used to link distinct views of the same model or different models with respect to mouse-based view operations: rotation, translation, zooming, etc. You must enable this item for each View window that you want to synchronize. Note that synchronization does not affect other display choices and that views are automatically synchronized with respect to structural changes.</p>
				<p class="less-so-heading-2"><a name="wins" id="wins"></a>Selecting View Windows</p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">The <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Windows</span> menu contains items that control which view windows are open and/or visible. All views and associated dialogs of a molecule group can be hidden/shown by checking/unchecking the corresponding item in the <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Windows=&gt;Molecule Groups </span>submenu. Individual view windows can be hidden or shown using the corresponding item at the bottom of the main <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Windows</span> menu. Selecting a window here makes it the active view. Note that hiding is not the same as closing and is solely for the purpose of managing screen space. It is also different from minimizing a window as no icon is visible for a hidden window.</p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">The <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Show All</span> and <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Show None</span> items on the <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Windows=&gt;Molecule Groups</span> submenu display and hide windows for all model groups (respectively). The related <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Windows=&gt;Minimize All</span>, <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Windows=&gt;Restore</span>, and <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Windows=&gt;Restore All</span> menu items respectively minimize, open the active view, or open all minimized view windows (but not hidden ones). The <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Windows=&gt;Close</span> and <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Windows=&gt;Close All </span>items close the active window or all view windows (respectively).</p>

				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph"><img src="web_pix/i_paste_arrow.jpg" alt="i_paste_arrow.tif" /><br />
			    There are several options for pasting molecules from the clipboard. The <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Edit=&gt;Paste</span> menu item accesses a slideoff menu containing three items. These items can also be reached via the small downward pointing triangle on the <span class="items-in-text-button-in-text">Paste</span> button. Clicking on the <span class="items-in-text-button-in-text">Paste</span> icon itself (avoiding the triangle’s panel) selects the <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Replace Molecule</span> item.</p>

					<li class="common-bullet"><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Write Cartesians</span>: If checked, the molecular structure is written in Cartesian coordinates in the saved file. By default, a Z-matrix is written.</li>
					<li class="common-bullet"><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Append Extra Input</span>: This control is active for models which were read in from Gaussian input files.

Thus, to save the current image at 300 dpi at twice its current size, you would use an enlargement factor of 8. Note that the computation time for rendering increases as the square of the enlargement factor.</li>
					<li class="common-bullet"><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">White Background</span>: Use a white background. The background in its View window is used if this item is unchecked. </li>
