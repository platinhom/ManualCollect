<b>7.</b>	Append the file you just saved to the display on the View window: copy the file to make it appear in the Current Fragment window, then click in the View window to paste the current fragment.
<p>
<b>8.</b>	Rotate and move the second ring so that the two carbon atoms to be bonded are close together, and the two fragments are oriented properly with respect to one another.<p>
<img src="pix/tip.jpg"><i>To affect just one of the two fragments, hold down the Alt key while dragging the mouse. Using a second window is often helpful when performing complex positioning operations. Use the <font color="#0000FF"><strong>Add View</strong></font> option on the View menu to create one.</i>
<p>
<b>9.</b>	Delete the hydrogen atoms on the two carbon atoms to be bonded.
<p>
<b>10.</b>	Create a double bond between the two carbon atoms: select the Modify Bond icon on the Builder window, then click on the two carbon atoms to be bonded. The SmartSlide window opens; choose the double bond option from the Bond-Type list and click OK.

<font color="#0000FF" size="4"><b>Assigning Atoms to ONIOM Layers in a Small Peptide Chain</b></font><br>
<em>Note: This example is devised for its illustrative clarity rather than for scientific interest.</em> <em>Your molecule may look different from the figures below.</em>
<p><b>1.</b>	Create a peptide chain containing these amino acids: Phe-Ala-Gly: use the Biological Fragment palette to choose an Amino-Terminal Phenylalanine, a Central Fragment Alanine and a Carboxyl-Terminal Glycine, placing each in the same View window and bonding them as shown previously in this tutorial.
<p>
<b>2.</b>	Assign all atoms to the Low Layer.  Choose <b><font color="#0000FF">Select Layer</font></b> from the <b><font color="#0000FF">Edit</font></b> menu, and then click <font color="#000000">Select All.</font>  Verify that current layer is set to <b><font color="#0000FF">Low</font>.</b>  The display will look similar to the following figure.<p>  
<img src="tut_pix/low_layer.jpg"><br>
 Click Apply.
<p>
<b>3.</b>	Assign the following atoms to the Medium layer: all atoms in Ala, carbons in Ring in Phe and atoms up to the double bond in Gly. Use any selection method you want; it will usually take two or more operations to assign all these atoms. For example, you can select the central carbon atom in Ala and drag the Expand Selection slider to add more atoms. Adding too few atoms is usually easier than adding too many.  Click Apply.<br>
Add additional atoms as necessary (use the center mouse button [or Shift+Click] to select,  then click Apply)  until the selection is correct as in the following figure. The atoms in the Medium layer are now displayed as tubes and the ones in the Low layer are in wireframe in the display:
<p>
<img src="tut_pix/med_layer.jpg">
<p> 
<b>4.</b>	Assign the following atoms to the High layer: all atoms in Ala, including heavy atoms bonded to them.	One selection method is to click the central carbon in Ala, change Using field to <b><font color="#0000FF">Distance</font></b>, and click twice at the right end of Expand Selection. The display will be as in the following figure:<p>
 <img src="tut_pix/high_layer.jpg">
<p>
 Click Apply. The display is as in the following figure:<p>
 <img src="tut_pix/oniom.jpg"><br>
 <b>Completed ONIOM-Assigned Molecule</b><p>
 Remove the hydrogen atom that was just placed into the high layer by selecting it and then placing it in the Medium layer.
<p>
Click Close.
<p> The atom layer assignment is now complete.
Save your work.
