				<p class="less-so-heading-1">Advanced Building Features</p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">In this section, we look at the special purpose building features designed for specific tasks and circumstances.</p>
				<p class="less-so-heading-2"><a name="custfrag" id="custfrag"></a>Using a Custom Fragment Library</p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">The <span class="items-in-text-button-in-text">Custom Fragment</span> button can be used to access and modify a local fragment library. Clicking on it when it is inactive activates the last used custom fragment library; the first fragment within it becomes the current fragment, appearing in the area below the toolbars and in the popup menu to the right of the various building buttons. Clicking on the same button when it is selected opens the <span class="items-in-text-dialog-names">Custom Fragments</span> palette, bringing up the window in Figure 28.</p>
				<p class="common-figure"><img src="web_pix/p_custom.jpg" alt="p_custom.tif" /></p>
				<p class="less-so-figtitle">Figure 28. The Custom Fragments Window</p>
				<p class="less-so-caption">This palette allows you to select from the available fragments in the open library. The selected fragment will become the current fragment once the dialog is exited.</p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">The <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Library</span> field at the top of the palette indicates the fragment library that is in use. Previously opened libraries are also present in the list. Additional library locations may be opened by clicking on the button labeled “<span class="items-in-text-button-in-text">...</span>”.</p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">Fragment libraries are simply folders on disk, and individual fragments within a library are stored as files within that folder. Thus, creating a new fragment library consists of creating a folder at the desired location and then selecting it in this palette. The library will obviously be initially empty. Any non-fragment files within the folder are ignored, although best practice is to limit fragment library folder use solely to fragment files.</p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">Fragments within a fragment library are organized into a series of user-defined groups. If this feature has not been used, then all fragments will be within the “root” group: i.e.,<span class="items-in-text-object-in-text"> /</span> as in the figure. </p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">A context menu, reached by right clicking within the white fragment list area in the center of the palette, is used to manage and modify fragment libraries. It has the following selections:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="common-bullet"><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">New Group</span>: Create a new group within the current library. The group is initially given a generic name which you can modify. Control-G is equivalent to this menu selection (Command-N under Mac OS X).</li>
					<li class="common-bullet"><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">New Fragment From Active Molecule</span>: Add the current molecule within the currently selected group within the current fragment library. A generic label and description will be set which you should edit as appropriate. In this context, Control-N/Command-N has the same function as this menu item.</li>
					<li class="common-bullet"><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Edit Cell</span>: Edit the text within the current item (group name, fragment name, fragment description). Note that the top level group name cannot be modified.</li>
					<li class="common-bullet"><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Delete</span>: Delete the currently selected fragment or fragment group. Note that the top-level fragment group cannot be deleted. The Delete key is equivalent to this menu item.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">Note that fragments within a library can be updated only by removing and then readding them (there is no way to modify an existing fragment).</p>
				<p class="less-so-heading-2"><a name="aed" id="aed"></a>The Atom List Editor</p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">The <span class="items-in-text-dialog-names">Atom List Editor</span> window is displayed when you select the <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Edit=&gt;Atom List</span> menu item or click on the <span class="items-in-text-button-in-text">Atom List</span> button. This tool presents the coordinates and other parameters for the molecule in the active View window in an editable spreadsheet format. The window’s default configuration is illustrated in Figure 29.</p>
				<p class="common-figure"><img src="web_pix/ed_aed.jpg" alt="ed_aed.tif" /></p>
				<p class="less-so-figtitle">Figure 29. The Atom List Editor</p>
				<p class="less-so-caption">The columns that are present in the table are controlled by the buttons in the toolbar. Columns corresponding to highlighted buttons are visible. Only buttons relevant to the current molecular structure are active. Individual columns may be displayed/hidden using the items on the Columns menu. You can also go directly to a specific atom (by number) using the Go To control in the toolbar.</p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">The default configuration of this window displays the molecule’s Z-matrix and Cartesian coordinates. Different data can be selected for display using the toolbar buttons. From the left, they control Z-matrix coordinates (<span class="items-in-text-button-in-text">Z</span>), Cartesian coordinates (<span class="items-in-text-button-in-text">C</span>), fractional coordinates for PBC jobs (<span class="items-in-text-button-in-text">F</span>), ONIOM layer assignments and related settings (<span class="items-in-text-button-in-text">L</span>), Molecular Mechanics atoms types and other data (<span class="items-in-text-button-in-text">M</span>), Isotope specification (<span class="items-in-text-button-in-text">I</span>), and PDB file residue and chain data (<span class="items-in-text-button-in-text">P</span>). Columns corresponding to the final button are read-only. Figure 26 illustrates the columns that may be present in this window. Clicking one of the lettered display icons will show or hide all columns in that group. You can also control the display of every individual column by selecting or deselecting it in the <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Columns</span> menu.</p>
				<p class="common-figure"><img src="web_pix/ed_aed_more.jpg" alt="ed_aed_more.tif" /></p>
				<p class="less-so-figtitle">Figure 30. Additional Atom List Editor Columns</p>
				<p class="less-so-caption">Beginning at the top and moving down and from left to right, these columns are controlled by the ONIOM Layers button, the Molecular Mechanics Parameters button, the Fractional Coordinates button, the PDB Info button, and the Isotope Masses button. Note that shaded columns are read-only.</p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">Any of the molecular parameters can be edited in this spreadsheet-like window. Atoms may be selected by clicking on their <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Row</span> cell in the leftmost column (and deselected by clicking it a second time). The dot in the <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Highlight</span> column causes the corresponding atoms to also be selected/deselected in the molecule’s View window. </p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">You can add additional atoms by scrolling to the bottom of the window, selecting an element in the <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Symbol</span> column, and then clicking the <span class="items-in-text-button-in-text">Add</span> button. This inserts a new row into the list (filled with default values, as in Figure 30 above).</p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">The various menu items in the <span class="items-in-text-dialog-names">Atom List Editor</span> window are described below. The <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">File</span> menu includes items related to saving and printing the data in the table:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="common-bullet"><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Export Data</span>: Save the data as a tab-separated format text file.</li>
					<li class="common-bullet"><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Print</span>: Print the atom list table.</li>

The <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Clear</span> option on the <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Action</span> menu will remove any assigned charges from the specified atoms.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="common-figure"><img src="web_pix/ale_mmcharges.jpg" alt="ale_mmcharges.tif" /></p>
				<p class="less-so-figtitle">Figure 31. Assigning MM Charges with the Atom List Editor</p>
				<p class="less-so-caption">This dialog is used to automatically assign charges to atoms for use in Molecular Mechanics calculations. The Target menu specifies which atoms should be assigned charges: all atoms, all selected atoms, or all atoms currently lacking an MM charge. The Action menu specifies which charge scheme should be used. Amber94 charges are always available. The other options in the list are available when they have been previously computed for the structure in a Gaussian calculation. </p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">The <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">View</span> menu controls atom highlighting within view windows while the <span class="items-in-text-dialog-names">Atom List Editor</span> is in use. Each item in the first section is a toggle, and check mark next to it within the menu indicates that it is enabled:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="common-bullet"><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Exclusive Highlighting</span>: Only allow one row within the table to be highlighted. Clicking on the dot within the <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Highlight</span> column deletes any current highlight.</li>
					<li class="common-bullet"><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Z-Matrix Connectivity Highlighting</span>: For each highlighted atom, also highlight the other atoms used to define its Z-matrix entry (i.e., bond, angle and dihedral specification).</li>
					<li class="common-bullet-full-space"><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">ONIOM Link Highlighting</span>: Display atoms for which the highlighted atom functions as a link atom for ONIOM calculations (labeled in the View window with <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">[Link]</span>), based on the contents of the row’s ONIOM layer data.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">The remaining items on the <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">View</span> menu have the following effects:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="common-bullet"><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Center Highlighted Atoms in View</span>: Reposition the structure in the active View window so that highlighted atoms appear in the center.</li>
					<li class="common-bullet"><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Select/Deselect Highlighted Atoms</span>: Add/remove highlighted atoms from the current selection.</li>
					<li class="common-bullet-full-space"><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Highlight Crowded Atoms</span>: Turn on highlighting for atoms that are unphysically close to one another (within 0.75 Angstroms).</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="common-keep">The <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Rows</span> menu controls whether some or all atoms within the molecule are visible in the table and also provides some shortcuts for selecting groups of atoms:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="common-bullet"><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Sublist Filters</span>: Open the <span class="items-in-text-dialog-names">Sublist Filters</span> dialog for defining atom filter expressions (described below).</li>
					<li class="common-bullet"><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Sort Selected</span>: Sort highlighted atom list rows, according to the criterion selected in the submenu: <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Ascending by Highlight</span>, or <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Descending by Highlight</span>. The up and down arrow buttons in the toolbar are equivalent to these submenu items.</li>
					<li class="common-bullet"><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Sublist</span>: Toggle display of atoms in and/or not in the active sublist, depending on the submenu item that is chosen (<span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Show Sublist Atoms</span> or <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Show Non-Sublist Atoms</span>). Current selections are indicated by a check mark next to the corresponding item on the submenu.</li>
					<li class="common-bullet"><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Select All</span>: Select all atoms unconditionally. </li>
					<li class="common-bullet"><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Invert Selection</span>: Deselect all currently selected atoms and select all deselected ones. </li>
					<li class="common-bullet-full-space"><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Select Rows of Selected Atoms </span>and<span class="items-in-text-object-in-text"> Select Atoms of Selected Rows</span>: Cause the selected atoms in the View and the selected rows in the table to be identical.

				</ul>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">The <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Columns</span> menu allows you to specify which columns appear in the table on an individual column basis. The first few items in the menu correspond to the default columns in the table, which are independent of the various column display buttons. The <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Freeze</span> and <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Gaussian Fragment</span> items further down in the list function in the same way. </p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">You can select which columns appear for the <span class="items-in-text-button-in-text">Z-matrix Coordinates</span>, <span class="items-in-text-button-in-text">Fractional</span> <span class="items-in-text-button-in-text">Coordinates</span>, <span class="items-in-text-button-in-text">ONIOM</span> <span class="items-in-text-button-in-text">Layers</span>, <span class="items-in-text-button-in-text">PDB</span> <span class="items-in-text-button-in-text">Info</span>,<span class="items-in-text-button-in-text"> Isotope Masses</span> and <span class="items-in-text-button-in-text">Molecular Mechanics Parameters</span> buttons via the corresponding submenus. The <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Cartesian Coordinates</span> item has the same function as the corresponding button although individual coordinates cannot be selected separately. </p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">The <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Help</span> menu item provides help for the <span class="items-in-text-dialog-names">Atom List Editor</span>.</p>
				<p class="less-so-heading-3"><a name="sublist" id="sublist"></a>Using Sublist Filters</p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">Sublist filters are a means of limiting the visible rows within the <span class="items-in-text-dialog-names">Atom List Editor</span> to a manageable number for large molecules. They are defined by means of a dialog reached with the <span class="items-in-text-dialog-names">Atom List Editor</span>’s <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Rows=&gt;Sublist Filters</span> menu path, illustrated in Figure 32.</p>
				<p class="common-figure"><img src="web_pix/ed_aed_sublist.jpg" alt="ed_aed_sublist.tif" /></p>
				<p class="less-so-figtitle">Figure 32. Creating Sublist Filters</p>
				<p class="less-so-caption">This dialog allows you to create and apply sublist filters which are used to limit the rows which are displayed within the Atom List Editor. In this case, we apply two filters in succession: Filter 1 selects atoms in the High ONIOM layer and Filter 2 selects oxygen and nitrogen atoms within that subset.</p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">To use the facility, you must first create a filter using the <span class="items-in-text-button-in-text">New Filter</span> button. Filters are always named <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Filter n</span> and cannot be renamed. The filter is defined using items from within the <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Criteria</span> list; the popup menu displays the available categories of criteria items. In the figure, we are using the <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">ONIOM</span> category to define <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Filter 1</span>. Select one or more criteria from the list and then use the <span class="items-in-text-button-in-text">&gt;</span> button to move them to the selected filter. Although we have not done so in the example, items from different <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Criteria</span> categories can be combined with the same filter.</p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">The <span class="items-in-text-button-in-text">&gt;&gt;</span> button will similarly move all items within the list. Items can be removed from filters using the <span class="items-in-text-button-in-text">&lt;</span> and <span class="items-in-text-button-in-text">&lt;&lt;</span> items, to remove the selected item and all items (respectively). An entire filter is removed with the <span class="items-in-text-button-in-text">Remove Filter</span> button. </p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">Criteria within filters are combined with an OR logic: any atom matching any criterion will be displayed (or not, according to the settings on the <span class="items-in-text-dialog-names">Atom List Editor</span>’s <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Rows=&gt;Sublist </span>submenu). Filters are activated and deactivated by selecting/deselecting the check box to the left of their name. When only a single filter is active, all atoms matching that filter are affected. When more than one filter is active, then all active filters are applied in series, in the order in which they are listed within the dialog, according to an AND logic. For example, <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Filter 2</span> is applied only to the matching atoms remaining after applying <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Filter 1</span>. Subsequent filters will never enlarge the selection resulting from a previous filter, but rather only filter it further.</p>
				<p class="common-keep">The available <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Criteria</span> categories are: </p>
				<ul>
					<li class="common-bullet"><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Tags</span>: Select one or more atom tag numbers (serial numbers).</li>
					<li class="common-bullet"><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Tag</span> <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">List</span>: Select a list of atom tags.</li>
					<li class="common-bullet"><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Elements</span>: Select atoms by element type.</li>
					<li class="common-bullet"><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">ONIOM</span>: Select atoms by ONIOM layer, layer boundary and/or link atom presence.</li>
					<li class="common-bullet-full-space"><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">MM</span>: Select atoms having undefined Molecular Mechanics atoms types and/or MM charges.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">Filters are specific to individual molecule groups, and they do not persist across different sessions for the corresponding input file. In other words, if you close and reopen the input file or if you exit and restart GaussView, current filters are lost.</p>
				<p class="less-so-heading-3"><a name="iso" id="iso"></a>Defining Isotope Masses and Isotopologues</p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph"><img src="web_pix/ale_iso_menu.jpg" alt="ale_iso_menu.tif" /><br />
			    The <span class="items-in-text-dialog-names">Atom List Editor</span> provides an easy way for specifying alternate isotope masses for atoms which are relevant for some calculation types (e.g., vibration frequency analysis). By default, Gaussian assigns the most abundant isotope to each atom in a molecular structure. You can specify a different isotope by enabling the <span class="items-in-text-button-in-text">Isotope Masses</span> button. Doing so will reveal a column titled <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Mass (Isotopologue 0)</span>. Each cell in the column contains a popup menu listing the possible isotopes for the element in that row of the table. You can select the desired isotope from the menu, or you may enter the desired value directly into the field. The <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Default</span> choice always refers to the most abundant isotope. </p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">You can define multiple isotopologues for the structure by adding additional columns to the table via the <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Columns=&gt;Mass=&gt;Mass (Isotopologue n)</span> menu paths. These can be used for subsequent vibrational analysis visualization (discussed later).</p>
				<p class="less-so-heading-2"><a name="pre" id="pre"></a>The PDB Residue Editor and The PDB Secondary Structure Editor</p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">Examining and modifying structures imported from PDB files may be made easier by the <span class="items-in-text-dialog-names">PDB Residue Editor</span> and <span class="items-in-text-dialog-names">PDB Secondary Structure Editor</span>, reached via the correspondingly named items on the <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Edit </span>menu. They are illustrated in Figure 33.</p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">The menus in these editors are very similar to those in the <span class="items-in-text-dialog-names">Atom List Editor</span> discussed in the previous section. Briefly, they are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="common-bullet"><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">File</span>: Contains items for exporting the data, printing the table and closing the editor.</li>
					<li class="common-bullet"><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Edit</span>: Contains items for undoing and redoing operations, copying data between rows, deleting all atoms or hydrogen atoms within selected residues/secondary structures, and adding hydrogens to the selected residues/secondary structures.</li>
					<li class="common-bullet"><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">View</span>: Items allow you to enable/disable exclusive highlighting, center highlighted atoms in the View window, and select /deselect atoms within highlighted items.</li>
					<li class="common-bullet"><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Rows</span>: Allows you to sort the selected table rows and perform various selection operations.</li>
					<li class="common-bullet"><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Columns</span>: Used to show or hide various columns from the table.</li>

				<p class="less-so-caption">The PDB Residue Editor (top) and PDB Secondary Structure Editor provide mainly read-only views of residue and other data assigned in PDB files. The Display column can be used to hide the atoms in certain residues/secondary structures for easier viewing of the molecule’s key features. The Highlight column can be used to highlight the atoms corresponding to the selected item. In this example, we have highlighted residue 12 in chain A making it easy to locate in the View window below.</p>

You can also use it to automatically reorder atoms to align atom tags between related structures across a molecule group (useful for preparing structures for QST2 and QST3 transition structure optimizations). Manual atom reordering is also possible.</p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">When the <span class="items-in-text-dialog-names">Connection Editor</span> is active, the molecule will be analyzed to determine if the atom tags match across the entire molecule group, and the status bar will report the result.

Clicking on the corresponding button will tell the <span class="items-in-text-dialog-names">Connection Editor</span> to reorder the atom labels to remove these mismatches. The success or failure of autofixing will be reported on the status bar. When autofixing is active, any manual reordering of atom tags will cause autofixing to be called and remove any mismatches that might have been introduced. </p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">When active, autofixing can be disabled using the relabeled <span class="items-in-text-button-in-text">Disable Autofixing</span> button.

				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph"><img src="web_pix/ed_mo_mv.jpg" alt="ed_mo_mv.tif" /><br />
			    To the right of the <span class="items-in-text-dialog-names">Current Surface</span> is the MO energy and occupancy diagram showing the MOs for the current molecule if available, initially arranged in order of increasing energy. Alpha and Beta electrons are represented by red up and down arrows in a blue box, respectively. Electrons can be moved from one MO to another by dragging them between the corresponding boxes. Electrons can also be added or removed from an MO by right-clicking in the MO box. Manipulating the MO occupancies in this way changes the net charge and/or spin multiplicity of the molecule as appropriate, reflected in the <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Charge</span> and <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Spin</span> fields. These fields can also be edited directly, and any changes will be reflected in the MO occupancies. Increasing the charge will remove electrons from the MOs, starting with the HOMO. Decreasing the charge will add electrons to the MOs, starting with the LUMO (or the HOMO if it is singly occupied). Similarly, increasing the spin multiplicity will move electrons from the highest doubly occupied MOs to the lowest virtual MOs, and decreasing the spin multiplicity will move electrons from the lowest-energy singly occupied MOs to the highest-energy singly occupied MOs. Finally, modifying the charge will also affect the spin multiplicity if the charge is changed by an odd number.</p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">Controls in the <span class="items-in-text-dialog-names">Calculation</span> panel also serve this purpose. The <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Adjust Occupancies</span> popup contains two choices:</p>

The <span class="items-in-text-dialog-names">After</span> panel (see Figure 48) specifies how the structure is treated after a fragment is added.</p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">Here are some preliminary definitions necessary for understanding the options in these panels:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="common-bullet">The <span class="items-in-text-italics">target</span> <span class="items-in-text-italics">atom</span> is the one selected with a mouse click.</li>
					<li class="common-bullet-ns">The <span class="items-in-text-italics">hot</span> <span class="items-in-text-italics">atom</span> is the atom in the new fragment that takes the place of the existing target atom when the two pieces are joined.</li>
					<li class="common-bullet">A <span class="items-in-text-italics">terminal</span> <span class="items-in-text-italics">atom</span> is any atom bonded to only one atom.</li>
					<li class="common-bullet">A <span class="items-in-text-italics">terminal valence atom</span> is a hydrogen atom or an open valence bonded to only one atom.</li>
					<li class="common-bullet-full-space">A join-bond is a bond between the hot atom and any terminal atom.

					<li class="common-bullet"><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Fragment Join-Bonds Can Be Any Terminal Bonds</span>: Normally, only hydrogen or open valences are taken as join-bonds.

				<ul>
					<li class="common-bullet"><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Create Fragment Join-Bonds If Necessary</span>: This option will allow most fragments to be attached to any target. If the fragment does not have enough join-bonds for a given target selection, additional valences will be added to satisfy the requirement. Again, the join-bonds are deleted when fragment and target are joined as well as the target atom (on by default).</li>
					<li class="common-bullet"><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Terminal Hot Atoms Define Join-Bonds</span>: This option makes it easier to choose terminal atoms as hot atoms. Since most terminal atoms have no join-bonds, the option will use the one bond as the join-bond. However, the bond will not be deleted. This is useful when you have a central atom with more than one terminal bond, and you want to explicitly choose which terminal bond will be used to do the joining.</li>
					<li class="common-bullet"><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Bond to Target Atom Instead of Deleting It</span>. This option allows you to bond the fragment to target atom itself, deleting only the join-bonds.</li>
					<li class="common-bullet"><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Delete Any Terminal Atoms Bonded to Target Atom</span>: Remove extra terminal bonds.</li>
					<li class="common-bullet"><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Automatically Select Hot Atom</span>: This item is designed for use with biological fragments (which is its default setting).
