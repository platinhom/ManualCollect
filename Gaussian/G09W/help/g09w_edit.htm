<h2><a name="enter_mofid" id="enter_modif"></a>The Job Edit Window</h2>
<p>This window is used to create and edit <em>Gaussian 09</em> input files. It
has two titles: <strong>Job Entry</strong>, when used to create new input, and <strong>Existing
File Job Edit</strong>, when used to modify an existing input file. Note that
new input and changes to existing input files are stored in memory as they are
made&mdash;and thus will be used when job execution begins&mdash;but they must
be explicitly saved to disk.</p>
<p align="left"><img src="g09w_images/wdw_edit.jpg" alt="Job Edit Window"></p>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The File Menu </font></h3>
<p>The <strong>File</strong> menu allows you to load and save <em>Gaussian 09</em> input
files. Some of its options have equivalent icons (described later in this section).</p>
<p><strong>Load </strong><br />
Load an existing input file (extension <strong>.GJF</strong>), replacing any
current input. If the filename field is filled in, this file will be loaded.
If it is blank, then you will be prompted for the file to load. The loaded file
replaces any current input (after prompting for needed saves).</p>
<p>If you select the <strong>Load</strong> option without changing the contents
of the filename field, then the current input will revert to the last-saved form
on disk (provided that you answer <strong>No</strong> to the save prompt).</p>
<p><strong>Save Job </strong><br />
Save the current input to its original file (you will be prompted for a filename
if it is newly created input).</p>
<p><strong>Save Job As... </strong><br />
Save the current input to a file that you specify.</p>
<p><strong>External Editor </strong><br />
Invoke the external editor on the current input. The external editor is specified
via the preferences.</p>
<p><strong>Abandon Data </strong><br />
Exit from this window, discarding all input and changes.</p>
<p><strong>Exit</strong> <br />
Return to the <strong>Job Processing</strong> window. Current input is retained
but is not automatically saved.</p>
<p><strong>Exit &amp; Run</strong><br />
Return to the <strong>Job Processing </strong>window and begin executing the
current input (not automatically saved to disk).</p>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Edit Menu</font></h3>
<p>The <strong>Edit</strong> menu includes the standard Windows <strong>Edit</strong> menu
options <strong>Undo</strong>,<strong> Cut</strong>,<strong> Copy</strong>,<strong> Paste</strong>,
and <strong>Delete</strong>. It also has this additional option:</p>
<p><strong>Clear Form </strong><br />
Erase all information in all sections of the window. No warning is given about
any unsaved changes. You can create a new input file from this form by selecting <strong>Clear
Form</strong>, entering the desired input, and then saving it.</p>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Check-Route Option</font></h3>
<p>This item runs the <strong>Check Route</strong> utility on the current input
(described later in this document). There is an equivalent icon for this option
(described later).</p>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="set_jobstart" id="set_jobstart"></a>The
Set-Start Option</font></h3>
<p>This option enables you to set the starting job step for this input file (additional
job steps are discussed later in this section). The default is the main (first)
step;</p>
<p align="left"><img src="g09w_images/sel_job_step.jpg" alt="Select Job Step" align="center"></p>
<p>Select the starting step by double clicking on the desired step. Exit from
the window by choosing <strong>Close</strong> from the window&rsquo;s <strong>System</strong> menu
(reached via the close bar in its upper left corner). There is an equivalent
icon for this option (described later).</p>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Icons</font></h3>
<p>The following icons are available in the <strong>Job Edit </strong>window
(the equivalent menu item is in parentheses):</p>
<p><img src="g09w_images/exit_run.jpg" alt="Exit &amp; Run"> Return to main menu
and begin executing job (<strong>File &rarr;
Exit &amp; Run</strong>).<br />
<img src="g09w_images/exit.jpg" alt="Exit"> Return to the main menu (<strong>File
&rarr; Exit</strong>).<br />
<img src="g09w_images/save_job.jpg" alt="Save Job"> Save all current input to
disk (<strong>File &rarr;
Save Job</strong>).<br />
<img src="g09w_images/abandon.jpg" alt="Abandon"> Discard all input and return
to main menu (<strong>File &rarr;
Abandon Data</strong>).<br />
<img src="g09w_images/chk_route.jpg" alt="Check Route"> Run the Check Route utility
(<strong>Check-Route</strong>).<br />
<img src="g09w_images/set_start.jpg" alt="Set Start"> Specify the starting job
step (<strong>Set-Start</strong>).<br />
<img src="g09w_images/load.jpg" alt="Load"> Load an input file, always asking
for the filename, replacing any current input (after prompting for any needed
saves). Only present when editing an existing file (<strong>File &rarr;
Load</strong>).</p>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Additional Steps Button</font></h3>
<p>This button takes you to the<strong> Additional Job Steps</strong> window,
described in the next section. The display field to its right indicates the number
of additional job steps within this job.</p>
<h2><a name="multi_step" id="multi_step"></a>The Additional Job Steps Window</h2>
<p>The <strong>Additional Job Steps</strong> window is used to create and edit
multicomponent <em>Gaussian 09</em> jobs. Note that no file saving takes place
from this window; saves must be made from the <strong>Job Edit</strong> window.</p>
<p align="left"><img src="g09w_images/additional.jpg" alt="Additional Job Steps"></p>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Initial Window Appearance</font></h3>
<p>When you press the <strong>Additional Steps</strong> button for an input file
with only a single job step, the <strong>Additional Job Steps</strong> window
consists solely of its menu bar:</p>
<p align="left"><img src="g09w_images/add_init.jpg" alt="Adding steps"></p>
<p>The various input areas are not visible until you create a new step by selecting <strong>Add
Step</strong> from the <strong>Step</strong> menu.</p>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Step Menu</font></h3>
<p>The <strong>Step</strong> menu is used to create, remove, and rearrange the
order of job steps.</p>
<p><strong>Add Step</strong> <br />
Create a new job step after the current one. The contents of the <strong>% Section</strong>, <strong>Title
Section</strong>, and <strong>Charge &amp; Multipl.</strong> areas from the main
job are automatically copied to the new step. They may be edited as desired as
the additional areas are filled in.</p>
<p><strong>Delete Step</strong><br />
Remove the current step from the job.</p>
<p><strong><a name="reorder_steps" id="reorder_steps"></a>Reorder</strong> <br />
Change the order of the job steps using the <strong>Re-Ordering Data</strong> window
(described in a separate section later in this document).</p>
<p><strong>Load From File</strong><br />
Replace the current step with the job stored in an external file (you will be
prompted for the filename). If the file contains more than one job step itself
and the current step is the last job step, then all steps from the file will
be loaded in their current order.</p>
<p>If the file contains multiple job steps and the current step is not the last
step in the job, then only the first step from the file will be loaded, as the
current step, and an error message will be displayed.</p>
<p><strong>Exit </strong><br />
Return to the <strong>Job Edit</strong> window. There is an equivalent icon for
this menu item (described later in this section).</p>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Edit Menu</font></h3>
<p>The <strong>Edit</strong> menu contains the standard items: <strong>Undo</strong>,<strong> Cut</strong>,<strong> Copy</strong>,<strong> Paste </strong>and<strong> Delete</strong>.</p>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The View Menu</font></h3>
<p>The <strong>View</strong> menu allows you to move among the additional jobs
steps within the current job. Its items also have equivalent icons (described
later in this section).</p>
<p><strong>Next Step </strong><br />
Move to the next step (higher numbered) in the job.</p>
<p><strong>Prev Step </strong><br />
Move to the previous step in this job.</p>
<p><strong>Choose Step </strong><br />
Move to the job step number that you specify.</p>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Check-Route Item</font></h3>
<p>This item runs the <strong>Check Route</strong> facility on the current input
step (described in a separate section later in this document).</p>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Icons</font></h3>
<p>The following icons appear in the <strong>Additional Job Steps</strong> window
(the equivalent menu item is in parentheses):</p>
<p><img src="g09w_images/next.jpg" alt="Next Step"> Move to the next job step
(<strong>View: Next Step</strong>).<br />
<img src="g09w_images/prev.jpg" alt="Previous Step"> Move to the previous job
step (<strong>View: Prev Step</strong>).<br />
<img src="g09w_images/choose.jpg" alt="Choose Step"> Move to a specified step
number (<strong>View: Choose Step</strong>).<br />
<img src="g09w_images/chk_route.jpg" alt="Check Route"> Run the Check Route utility
(<strong>Check-Route</strong>).<br />
<img src="g09w_images/exit.jpg" alt="Exit"> Return to the Job Edit window (<strong>Step:
Exit</strong>).</p>
<h2><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Check Route Facility</font></h2>
<p>The <strong>Check Route</strong> facility verifies the route section of the
current input (or additional job step if run from the <strong>Additional Job
Steps </strong>window). It displays a window containing the route section, the
corresponding link map, and any error messages. This features corresponds to
the <strong>testrt</strong> utility provided with other <em>Gaussian</em> versions.</p>
<p align="left"><img src="g09w_images/cmd_route.jpg" alt="Route Facility"></p>
<p>The absence of any error message indicates a valid route section (although <strong>Check
Route</strong> cannot determine whether it is the one you intend or not). You
may exit from this window by pressing the <strong>Done</strong> button when you
have finished examining the <strong>Check Route </strong>output. Consult the <em>Gaussian
09 User&rsquo;s Reference</em> for more information on this facility.</p>
