<h1>Using Gaussian 09 with Linda</h1>
<p> This section describes the process of installing the Linda software you have purchased through Gaussian, Inc. and building a distributed-memory parallel version of Gaussian. It assumes that you have already built and tested the regular version of the program. It also assumes that you have read the normal installation instructions and also that you have access to the Gaussian 09 User&rsquo;s Reference.</p>
<h2>Linda Parallel Methods</h2>
<p>HF, CIS=Direct, and DFT calculations on molecules are Linda parallel, including energies, optimizations and frequencies. TDDFT energies and gradients and MP2 energies and gradients are also Linda parallel.  Portions of MP2 frequency and CCSD calculations are Linda parallel, but others are only SMP-parallel, so they see some speedup from using a few nodes but no further improvement from larger numbers of nodes.</p>
<p>It is always best to use SMP-parallelism within nodes and Linda only between nodes. For example on a cluster of 4 nodes, each with a dual quad-core EM64T, one should use</p>
<pre>
%NProcShared=8
%LindaWorkers=node1,node2,node3,node4
</pre>
<p>rather than using more than one Linda worker per node.</p>
<h2>Installing the Linda Software and Compiling G09/Linda</h2>
<p>If you have purchased Gaussian binaries, Linda is distributed on the same CD as the Gaussian binaries and no additional installation is necessary. </p>
<h2>Running Gaussian with Linda</h2>
<p>The Linda parallel programming model involves a master process, which runs on the current processor, and a number of worker processes which can run on other nodes of the network. So a Gaussian 09/Linda run must specify the number of processors to use, the list of processors where the jobs should be run, and occasionally other job parameters. An environment variable is generally the easiest way to specify this information (as we will see).</p>
<p>Each of these nodes needs to have some access to the Gaussian 09 directory
tree. The recommended configuration is to have G09 on each system that will be
used for the parallel job. Note that the Linda binaries need to have the same
path on each machine. If this is not feasible, the G09 tree can be made accessible
via a network-mounted disk which is accessed in an identical way on all
nodes.</p>  
<p>For MP2 calculations, each node must also have some local disk where Gaussian
09 can put temporary files. </p>
<h2>Configuring Gaussian 09/Linda</h2>
<p>Gaussian 09 gets configuration information from three primary sources</p>
<ul>
<li>
The Gaussian input file via <b><font color="#0000FF">%Link0</font></b> commands.
</li>
<li>
The <font color="#009933">Default.Route</font> file.
</li>
<li>
The environment variable <font color="#009933">GAUSS_LFLAGS</font>.
</li></ul>
<p>Details about <b><font color="#0000FF">%Link0</font></b> commands and the <font color="#009933">Default.Route</font> file can also be found in the Gaussian 09 User&rsquo;s Reference manual. Entries specific to Gaussian 09/Linda are described below.</p>
<h3><font size="-1" color="#222222">SPECIFYING THE WORKER COMPUTERS</font></h3>
<p>The <b><font color="#0000FF">%LindaWorkers</font></b> directive is used to specify computers where Linda worker processes should run. It has the following syntax:</p>
<pre>
<b>%LindaWorkers=</b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>node1</i></font>[:<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>n1</i></font>][,<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>node2</i></font>[:<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>n2</i></font>]] [&hellip;]
</pre>
<p>This lists the TCP node name for each node to use. By default, one Linda worker is started on each node, but the optional value allows this to be varied. A worker is always started on the node where the job is started (the master node) whether or not it appears in the node list. <b><font color="#0000FF">%LindaWorkers</font></b> may be combined with <b><font color="#0000FF">%NProcShared</font></b>. In this case, one or more parallel worker processes will be run on each node (the number still determined by the values in <b><font color="#0000FF">%LindaWorkers</font></b>). The value to <b><font color="#0000FF">%NProcShared</font></b> specifies the number of SMP processors/cores to use on each system in the worker node list.</p>
<p>Do not use the obsolete <b><font color="#0000FF">%NProcLinda</font></b> directive. G09 will compute the total number of Linda workers based on the <b><font color="#0000FF">%LindaWorkers</font></b> input.</p>
<p>The following directive causes a network parallel job to be run across the specified 5 nodes. Nodes <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>hamlet</i></font> and <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>ophelia</i></font> will each run two worker processes.</p>
<pre>
%LindaWorkers=hamlet:2,ophelia:2,laertes,horatio,lear
</pre>
<p>The following directives specify that a parallel job will be executed on hosts <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>norway</i></font>, <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>italy</i></font> and <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>spain</i></font>. Nodes <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>norway</i></font> and <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>italy</i></font> will each run one 4-way SMP parallel worker, and <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>spain</i></font> will run two such workers:</p>
<pre>
%NProcShared=4 &nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#CC0000"><i>Specifies four-way SMP parallelism.</i></font></font>
%LindaWorkers=norway,italy,spain:2
</pre>
<p>These directives make sense when <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>norway</i></font> and <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>italy</i></font> are 4 processor/core computers, and <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>spain</i></font> is an 8 processor/core computer.</p>
<p>Note that the <b><font color="#0000FF">%NProc</font></b> directive used in earlier Gaussian versions is obsolete.</p>
<h3><font size="-1" color="#222222">SPECIFYING THE AMOUNT OF MEMORY FOR A PARALLEL CALCULATION</font></h3>
<p>Memory is specified using the <b><font color="#0000FF">%Mem</font></b> Link0 command, just as for serial calculations.</p>
<h3><font size="-1" color="#222222">USING SSH INSTEAD OF RSH</font></h3>
<p>By default, Linda uses <b>rsh</b> to communicate between nodes. You can use <b>ssh</b> instead by including the following option in the <font color="#009933">GAUSS_LFLAGS</font> environment variable:</p>
<pre>
% <b>setenv GAUSS_LFLAGS '&hellip; -opt "Tsnet.Node.lindarsharg: ssh"'</b>
</pre>
<p>Another way to override this default, you need to create a configuration file in your home directory on the master node named <font color="#009933">.tsnet.config</font> which contains the following line:</p>
<pre>
Tsnet.Node.lindarsharg: ssh
</pre>
<p>This will cause <b>ssh</b> to be used instead. Note that passwordless <b>ssh</b> logins must already be configured from the master to all worker nodes.</p>
<h3><font size="-1" color="#222222">SPECIFYING OTHER LINDA OPTIONS</font></h3>
<p>A few Linda options that are sometime useful are:</p>
<pre>
 -v &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#CC0000"><i>Display verbose messages</i></font></font>
-vv &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#CC0000"><i>Display very verbose messages</i></font></font>
</pre>
<p>Use the <font color="#009933">GAUSS_LFLAGS</font> environment variable to set them.</p>
<p>For example, one could turn on very verbose Linda output using:</p>
<pre>
% <b>setenv GAUSS_LFLAGS -vv</b>
</pre>
<p>There are many other Linda options but most of them are not used by Gaussian.  Check the Linda manual on the Internet at <a href="http://www.lindaspaces.com/downloads/lindamanual.pdf"><font color="#FF5500">www.lindaspaces.com/downloads/lindamanual.pdf</font></a>. The <b>-opt</b> form can be used in <font color="#009933">GAUSS_LFLAGS</font> to invoke any valid <font color="#009933">.tsnet.config</font> file directive. Note that Gaussian 09/Linda does not use the native Linda resources <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>minworker</i></font> and <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>maxworker</i></font>.</p>
