				<p class="less-so-chapter">GaussView Basics</p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">The main GaussView interface consists of several windows, in addition to other dialogs which appear in the course of working. Figure 1 illustrates a simple session in which the user has just started to build a molecule.</p>
				<p class="common-figure"><img src="web_pix/fig1.jpg" alt="fig1.tif" /></p>
				<p class="less-so-figtitle">Figure 1. <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">GaussView on the Desktop</span></p>
				<p class="less-so-caption">Several GaussView features are visible here. At the top, we see the main GaussView control panel, containing the menu bar, a variety of toolbars, and the Current Fragment window. Below this, on the right, are the palettes used to select functional groups and individual atoms for addition to a molecule (note that these can function in a modal or amodal mode, according to user preference). At the bottom left is the active View window containing the molecule being built.</p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">The GaussView interface consists of these main components:</p>
<ul>
					<li class="common-bullet-ns">The control panel containing the menu bar and <span class="items-in-text-dialog-names">Current Fragment </span>display.</li>
					<li class="common-bullet-ns">Various toolbars. By default, these are placed below the menu bar in the control panel, but they may also be detached if desired (see Figure 3). They may also be rearranged within the control panel as desired (so your window may differ from the illustration in Figure 1). </li>
					<li class="common-bullet-ns">One or more molecule View windows. </li>
					<li class="common-bullet-ns">Dialogs corresponding to the various GaussView features.</li>
					<li class="common-bullet-ns">Preferences which control various aspects of the program’s functioning.</li>
</ul>
                <p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">The toolbars that appear by default under the menu bar in the GaussView control panel are illustrated individually in Figure 2. The <span class="items-in-text-dialog-names">Builder</span> toolbar can also appear as a standalone palette, as it does in Figure 2. You can open it with <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">View=&gt;Builder</span>. You can detach an individual toolbar from the main toolbar by grabbing the handle and dragging it out of the toolbar area. To reattach a standalone toolbar, either drag it back into the main toolbar or double click it.</p>
                <p class="common-figure"><img src="web_pix/toolbar_context.jpg" alt="toolbar_context.tif" /></p>
								<p class="less-so-figtitle">Figure 2. Toolbar Context Menu</p>
								<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">If you right click in the grey area within any toolbar, you will bring up the Toolbar context menu. The first section of the list contains the names of the toolbars that are available in that window. Selecting one of the toolbar names from the list will toggle it between its visible and hidden states. The <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Line Up</span> option causes the toolbars to move to eliminate empty space between them, and the <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Default</span> option restores the default configuration for that toolbar (when applicable).</p>
				<p class="common-figure"><img src="web_pix/toolbars.jpg" alt="toolbars.tif" /></p>
				<p class="less-so-figtitle">Figure 3. GaussView Toolbars in Standalone Mode</p>
<p class="less-so-captionc">The Builder palette on the right is revealed with the View=&gt;Builder menu path.</p>
				<p class="less-so-heading-1"><a name="mmgv" id="mmgv"></a>Molecules, Molecule Groups and Views</p>
<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">GaussView uses these constructs to organize the many molecules which are being utilized at any given time:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="common-bullet">A <span class="items-in-text-italics">molecule</span> is most often a single molecule being worked on in isolation from other ones that may also be open. A molecule generally corresponds to a single file stored on disk. These are also sometimes referred to as <span class="items-in-text-italics">models</span>. Note that a molecule in this sense may contain more than one chemical species (i.e., “molecules” in the usual chemical sense).</li>
					<li class="common-bullet">If there is more than one window open for the same molecule, the various different ones are referred to as <span class="items-in-text-italics">views</span>. Accordingly, a View window displays a molecule, and different views—and View windows—can display different orientations and properties of the same molecule.</li>
					<li class="common-bullet-full-space">A <span class="items-in-text-italics">molecule group</span> is a collection of one or more molecules that are worked on as a unit. Molecule groups containing more than one molecule display each one in a separate subwindow of a combination View window (see Figure 4). Molecule groups are also referred to as <span class="items-in-text-italics">model groups</span>.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">For molecule groups containing more than one molecule, there are two display modes. <span class="items-in-text-italics">Single-view mode</span> displays a single molecule at a time. The current molecule number appears in the toolbar. Clicking the single/multiview icon brings up <span class="items-in-text-italics">multiview mode</span> in which several molecules can be viewed at one time. Individual molecule views are contained within the larger multiview window. The molecule number is shown in the title bar of each frame. The currently active molecule is shown with a slightly lighter background to distinguish it from the other molecules and is the one involved in atom selections or in the dialogs. Clicking on one of the individual molecule windows that is not the active molecule window will cause it to become the active molecule. In the event that not all of the individual molecules can fit in the View window, a scroll bar at the bottom of the View window allows one to move between the different molecules.</p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">Clicking on the small triangle to the right of the single view/multiview icon reveals a small menu containing these items:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="common-bullet"><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Options</span>: Opens the <span class="items-in-text-dialog-names">MultiView Options</span> dialog (illustrated in the bottom left of Figure 4 and discussed below).</li>
					<li class="common-bullet"><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Fit</span>: Resize all individual molecule frames so all are visible in the window.</li>
					<li class="common-bullet-full-space"><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Synchronize</span>: Link all frames so that mouse actions in one affect all of them (e.g., rotations). By default, each view is independent.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="common-figure"><img src="web_pix/multiview.jpg" alt="multiview.tif" /></p>
				<p class="less-so-figtitle">Figure 4. A Molecule Group Containing 12 Molecules</p>
				<p class="less-so-caption">The multiview controls in the toolbar appear only when there is &gt;1 molecule in a molecule group. The single/multiple view icon toggles between single-window (upper left) and multi-window view (right). The MultiView Options dialog controls the layout and behavior of multiview display mode.</p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">View window title bars display information about the current molecule group, molecule and view: each distinct molecule group is identified by an icon whose color is uniquely associated with it. Figure 5 shows the color icons from two different view windows (each corresponding to a different molecule group). All dialogs that are directly associated with that molecule group will use the same color icon to visually associate themselves with their parent molecule group (including new views created using <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">View=&gt;Add View</span>). This color icon is also used to identify the molecule group in the <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Windows</span> menu.</p>
<p class="common-figure"><img src="web_pix/mg_labels.jpg" alt="mg_labels.tif" /></p>
				<p class="less-so-figtitle">Figure 5. Color Icons from 2 Different Views</p>
				<p class="less-so-caption">The icon on the left corresponds to the 4th molecule in the 1st molecule group (red), while the one on the right is the 2nd view of the 1st molecule in the second molecule group (green). This same color icon will appear in all dialogs associated with that molecule. For some operating systems, the color icon is located in the status bar.</p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">In addition to its color icon, each View window is uniquely identified by its group/molecule/view identifier. This identifier consists of the molecule group (<span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">G</span>), the molecule number (<span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">M</span>), and the view number (<span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">V</span>). Each of the molecules in a molecule group are numbered sequentially starting at 1. If a molecule in the group is deleted, the molecules are renumbered to maintain a continuous sequence. </p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">Note that dialogs corresponding to molecule editing function are molecule-specific. If you activate a different View window with, say, the <span class="items-in-text-dialog-names">Atom List Editor</span> open, its context does not follow. Examine the header label of a dialog in order to determine the corresponding View window.</p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">Right clicking anywhere within a molecule window will bring up a context menu. The contents of the context menu duplicates much of the Builder, the menu bars, and the toolbars. This is provided as a convenience for the user.</p>
				<p class="common-figure"><img src="web_pix/context_menu.jpg" alt="context_menu.tif" /></p>
				<p class="less-so-figtitle">Figure 6. View Window Context Menu</p>
				<p class="less-so-captionc">Each of the options on the context menu brings up a submenu containing related items.</p>
				<p class="less-so-heading-2"><a name="mview" id="mview"></a>Customizing MultiView Windows</p>
<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">The various controls in the <span class="items-in-text-dialog-names">MultiView Options</span> dialog have the following uses:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="common-bullet"><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Visible Rows</span> and <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Visible Columns</span>: Number of rows and columns of individual frames initially appearing in a multiview window.</li>
					<li class="common-bullet"><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Scrolling</span>: Placement of scroll bars.</li>
					<li class="common-bullet-full-space"><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Auto Fit SubWindows</span>: When unchecked, resizing the multiview window does not affect the size of the individual frames, and so more of them are typically visible when the window is made larger. When checked, individual frames are resized whenever the main window is, so that the same number of frames are always visible (based on the row and column values specified).</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">The following controls are visible when the <span class="items-in-text-button-in-text">More</span> button has been pressed:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="common-bullet-full-space"><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Workspace Margin</span>, <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Horizontal Spacing</span> and <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Vertical Spacing</span>: Padding around the block of individual view subwindows and between the individual columns and rows (respectively).</li>
					<li class="common-bullet-full-space"><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Borders</span>, <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Titles</span>, <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Captions</span> and <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Numbers</span>: When checked, <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Borders</span> displays border on individual view frames. <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Titles</span> and <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Numbers</span> control whether the job title and structure number appear in each frame title bar. <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Captions</span> controls all title bar text as a whole, and unchecking it suppresses all text regardless of the settings of the other items.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="less-so-heading-2"><a name="anim" id="anim"></a>Animating Multiple Structures</p>
<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">Clicking on the green run button in the toolbar for a multiview molecule group will cause the View window to show each molecule in the group sequentially and continue to cycle through the full list until stopped. This has the effect of visually animating the sequence of molecules like a movie. This can be particularly useful for animating a series of related geometries, such as a Reaction Path plot. After the green run button has been pressed, it turns into a red stop button, which will stop the animation.</p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">The small triangle next to the animation button contains a small menu. Its <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Loop</span> item causes the animation to loop continuously until stopped. The <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Reverse</span> item cause the frames to be displayed in highest-to-lowest order rather than in ascending frame number order. Note that these options cannot be set while an animation is running.</p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">The animation speed can be controlled by the user. For an individual View window, the animation delay can be changed in the <span class="items-in-text-dialog-names">Display Format</span> dialog’s <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Molecule</span> tab. The default animation delay is set in the <span class="items-in-text-dialog-names">Display Format Preferences</span>.</p>
				<p class="less-so-heading-1"><a name="mouse" id="mouse"></a>Using the Mouse</p>
<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">Interaction with molecules is designed around the movements of a three-button mouse. The functions of the mouse buttons are described in the following table:</p>
