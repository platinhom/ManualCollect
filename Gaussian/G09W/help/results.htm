				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">This section describes the <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Results</span> menu and the options available through it. This menu opens a series of dialog boxes that allow you to examine the results of calculations from Gaussian output files. If the selected item is not present in the file, the item is dimmed in the menu.</p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">The various spectra and plots produced by GaussView can all be customized and manipulated using common techniques. These procedures are discussed in the final part of this section of the manual.</p>

This tool manages the display of partial charge density as computed by various methods in Gaussian. Displays are available for the default Mulliken charges and other computed charges that are available for this job. The <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Charge Type</span> menu lists the available choices.</p>

				<p class="less-so-figtitle">Figure 84. Displaying Atomic Charges</p>
				<p class="less-so-caption">The dialog on the left is used to control what charges are shown and how they are displayed. The window in the middle shows the numeric charge numbers display, and the one on the right shows the atoms colored by charge (reflecting the settings in the dialog on the left), as well as the dipole moment vector.</p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">By default, the color spectrum for charge display is set by reading the maximum charge computed for the molecule and setting the range to match the charge. The range can also be adjusted manually by entering values into the <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Charge Range</span> fields.</p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">The remaining checkboxes in the top portion of this dialog have the following meanings:</p>

				</ul>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">The <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Dipole Moment</span> area of the dialog controls whether a vector representing the dipole moment is included in the display. When the vector is displayed, you can specify the scaling factor for the vector’s length (the default is about 1.0) as well as its origin.</p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">The buttons at the bottom of the <span class="items-in-text-dialog-names">Display Charge Distribution</span> dialog control whether the display persists after the dialog is closed.

It allows you to display various chemical data in three dimensions. The surface data may be generated from a Gaussian checkpoint file or be read in from a cube file. Note that there are two steps involved in actually displaying a surface:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="common-bullet-ns">Obtaining a cube by generating it or reading it in.</li>
					<li class="common-bullet-full-space">Generating the actual surface for display.</li>

				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">The following items in the <span class="items-in-text-dialog-names">Surfaces and Contours</span> dialog relate to cubes:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="common-bullet"><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Cubes Available</span>: Shows data that is currently available for display by GaussView. These items appear after cubes are produced using the <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">New Cube </span>option and after an existing cube file is loaded.</li>
					<li class="common-bullet-full-space"><span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Cube Actions</span>: Allows you to generate a new cube (<span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">New Cube</span>), load a cube from an external file (<span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Load Cube</span>), save the current cube to an external file (<span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Save Cube</span>), and remove the current item from the <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Cubes Available</span> list (<span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Remove Cube</span>).</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">The <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">New Cube</span> selection on the <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Cube Action</span> button’s menu brings up the dialog in Figure 87. It is used to generate new cubes from the electron density and other data in the checkpoint file. GaussView automatically invokes the CubeGen utility.</p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">The <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Type</span> popup selects the molecular property for which to generate a cube. For most selections, additional fields will appear to further specify the desired data. For example, in Figure 87, the density matrix to use when generating the electrostatic potential cube can be selected. Similarly, for molecular orbitals, the specific orbital(s) to generate are indicated via additional fields.</p>
				<p class="common-figure"><img src="web_pix/d_cube.jpg" alt="d_cube.tif" /></p>
				<p class="less-so-figtitle">Figure 87. The Generate Cubes Dialog</p>
				<p class="less-so-caption">This dialog will generate the type of cube specified in the Type field. Here, we are generating a cube of the electrostatic potential computed from the SCF electron density (frozen core by default).</p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">The <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Grid</span> field is used to specify the density of the cube. Increased density brings increased computational requirements. Generally, the default setting of <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Coarse</span> is adequate for most visualization purposes, <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Medium</span> is adequate for most printing and presentation purposes. The equivalent number of points per “side” is indicated in the second field in this line for each of the <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Coarse</span>, <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Medium</span> and <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Fine</span> selections.

				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">Clicking the <span class="items-in-text-button-in-text">Ok</span> button will generate the cube (as a background calculation) and exit the dialog. The new cube will appear in the <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Cubes Available</span> list when the calculation finishes. You can view the job via the <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Calculate=&gt;Current Jobs</span> menu item or the equivalent <span class="items-in-text-button-in-text">Current Jobs</span> button. <span class="items-in-text-italics">Note</span>: Cubes generated on the fly in this manner are not saved to disk unless you do so explicitly; otherwise, they will be lost when GaussView terminates.</p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">There are several items in the <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Type</span> popup that allow you to transform one or more cubes: you can scale and square cubes and add or subtract two cubes. For example, if you wanted to display a difference density, you can load in the two cube files (e.g., the densities computed in the gas phase and in solution). Once they are loaded, you can create a new cube (via <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Cube Actions=&gt;New Cube</span>) and then select <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Subtract Two Cubes</span> from the <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Type</span> menu. </p>

				</ul>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">View windows display mapped surfaces and include a color mapping toolbar at the top (as in the window on the right in Figure 90). The colors used in rendering a mapped surface are based on a uniform scaling between minimum and maximum values, as specified in the text boxes to the left and right of the spectrum (respectively). Changing the values in these boxes will change the color scale and correspondingly change the coloring on the mapped surface. Like other toolbars, this color mapping toolbar can be moved around the edges by simply clicking and holding on the grip bar and dragging around the window.</p>

				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">The<span class="items-in-text-object-in-text"> Z-Clip</span> slider is present in the dialog for all three surface types. It may be used to remove the frontmost portions of the image to allow views into the interior of the molecular display.</p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">The <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">IsoValues</span> popup controls whether the positive values, negative values or both (the default) are displayed. The <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Hide backside</span> checkbox controls whether the back side of surfaces are displayed. Checking it results in increased transparency for transparent surfaces. Try turning it on and off with the <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Format</span> set to <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Mesh</span> to see exactly what is being hidden or revealed.</p>

The default origin point is (0,0,0) and the default point defining the normal vector is (0,0,1).</p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">More complex plane definitions can be specified by clicking on the <span class="items-in-text-button-in-text">Define Plane</span> button, which brings up the dialog in Figure 94. There are two methods for defining the plane: <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Normal Vector</span> (as described above) and <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Three Points </span>(illustrated in the figure). In the latter method, you define the origin and two other points to define the contour plane (traditionally referred to as O, P and Q). The easiest way to define the points is to specify atoms for them, but you can also enter lists of atoms (the average of their coordinates will then be used) or completely arbitrary Cartesian coordinates.</p>
				<p class="common-figure"><img src="web_pix/d_cplane.jpg" alt="d_cplane.tif" /></p>
				<p class="less-so-figtitle">Figure 94. Specifying the Desired Contour Plane</p>

The green lines in the View window indicate the normal vector (labeled N) at the origin (O) and the line OQ. The OP line is not visible in this view as it mirrors the C-C bond between atoms 1 and 5.</p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">Once the contour plane is defined, you can move it further using the popup and other controls in the bottom part of the dialog. The plane can be translated or rotated about the various defined axes.</p>

				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">The <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Manual Displacement </span>box allows you to set the displacement as desired. When it is checked, animation of the vibration will be turned off. When checked, the slider, number box, and <span class="items-in-text-button-in-text">Save Structure</span> button become active. In this mode, changing the slider or the corresponding number box will cause the molecule to be statically displaced along the currently active normal mode. The center value of the slider, or zero in the text box, corresponds to no displacement. Moving the slider to the right or entering a positive value in the text box will displace the atoms along the currently active normal mode. Moving to the left or entering a negative value will displace the atoms in the direction opposite of the currently active normal mode. The range of values allowed in the text box ranges from -1 to +1. Clicking on <span class="items-in-text-button-in-text">Save Structure</span> will cause a new molecule window to appear with a geometry exactly corresponding to the displaced structure.</p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">The primary use of this tool is to help eliminate spurious negative eigenvalues. hen one is searching for a transition state, it is not uncommon to end up with a structure containing two (or more) negative eigenvalues instead. These spurious negative eigenvalues are generally small but must be eliminated to isolate the true transition state. For these cases, select the normal mode corresponding to the spurious negative eigenvalue, and then select <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Manual Displacement</span>. Adjust the slider to the right (or enter a positive number in the text box), and then select <span class="items-in-text-button-in-text">Save Structure</span> to create a new molecule with the displaced geometry, which you can then reoptimize. If a positive displacement fails to eliminate the spurious negative eigenvalue, follow the same procedure with a displacement in the negative direction. You can also try varying the magnitude of the displacement.</p>
				<p class="less-so-manual-paragraph">A second purpose of manual displacement is to generate pictures of a molecule in the midst of a vibration. Thus, it can be used to effectively freeze the animation of the vibration at a specific point.</p>

In that case, the dialog window can be resized to see more of them at the same time or the user can use the scroll bar to scroll down to see the desired plot. If several plots are visible then resizing the window expands/shrinks the X-axis while the plot height stays constant. In other words, only the height of the viewing area changes. <br /><br />When only one plot is visible—i.e., the dialog only contains one plot or the other plots have been hidden (see below)—then resizing the dialog expands/shrinks the plot along both axes. To focus on one or two plots, hide the other plots using the <span class="items-in-text-object-in-text">Plots</span> menu.</li>
