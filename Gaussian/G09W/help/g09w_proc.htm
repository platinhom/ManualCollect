<h2>The Job Processing Window</h2>
<p>The <strong>Job Processing</strong> window is the place from which <em>Gaussian
09W</em> jobs are controlled and executed and where their output is displayed.
Its main parts are described in the following illustration:</p>
<p align="left"><img src="g09w_images/wdw_job.jpg" alt="Main Window"></p>
<p>The remainder of this section discusses the menus and buttons available in
this window.</p>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The File Menu </font></h3>
<p>The <strong>File</strong> menu allows you to create and access <em>Gaussian
09W</em> input files and to set program preferences.</p>
<p><strong>New</strong><br />
Create new <em>Gaussian 09W</em> input (residing only in memory until it is explicitly
saved to disk).</p>
<p><strong>Open...</strong> <br />
Open an existing <em>Gaussian 09W</em> input file. The extension of a <em>Gaussian
09W</em> input file is .GJF. The <strong>Open...</strong> menu item may also
be used to load an existing batch control file. The batch facility is described
later in this section. Finally, it may be used to open a PDB file for conversion
(this process is discussed later).</p>
<p><strong>Modify...</strong> <br />
Edit the current input, via the <strong>Existing File Job Edit</strong> window. </p>
<p><strong>Preferences </strong><br />
Set <em>Gaussian 09W</em> preferences. Preferences are described in a separate
section later in this document.</p>
<p><strong>Exit</strong> <br />
Exit from <em>Gaussian 09W</em>. You will be prompted whether to save any unsaved
new or modified input files as well as any unsaved changes to the preferences.</p>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="running" id="running"></a>The
Process Menu</font></h3>
<p>The <strong>Process</strong> menu allows you to manipulate executing jobs.
All of its items have equivalent icons in the <strong>Job Processing</strong> window
(described later in this section).</p>
<p><strong>Begin Processing </strong><br />
Begin executing the currently loaded input.</p>
<p><strong><a name="pause" id="pause"></a>Pause </strong><br />
Immediately suspend the currently executing job.</p>
<p><strong>Pause &rarr; Next Link</strong> <br />
Suspend execution of the currently executing job after it completes the current
link. (The <em>Gaussian 09</em> program is divided into a series of modules known
as<em> links</em>. Different links perform different parts of the calculation,
and the various links execute sequentially, making up the total job.)</p>
<p><strong>Resume</strong> <br />
Restart execution of a paused job.</p>
<p><strong><a name="k_job" id="k_job"></a>Kill Job </strong><br />
Immediately abort the currently executing job. If a batch is running, the next
job in the batch (batches are formally defined later in this section) will begin
executing (unless the <strong>End Batch Run on Error</strong> preference is set).</p>
<p><strong><a name="e_batch" id="e_batch"></a>End Batch </strong><br />
Stop executing the current batch when the current job finishes.</p>
<p><strong><a name="k_batch" id="k_batch"></a>Kill Batch </strong><br />
Immediately abort the currently executing job and terminate batch processing
without running any more<br />
jobs.</p>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Utilities Menu</font></h3>
<p>The <strong>Utilities</strong> menu gives you access to the batch and file
conversion facilities and other utilities provided with <em>Gaussian 09W</em>.
We&rsquo;ll consider them in detail later in this manual.</p>
<p><strong>Edit Batch List </strong><br />
Edit the currently loaded batch control file (extension<strong> .BCF</strong>),
via the <strong>Edit Batch List </strong>window (described later). If no batch
control file is loaded, then a new batch list is created and any currently loaded
input is erased from memory.</p>
<p><strong>NewZMat </strong><br />
Convert files using the <strong>NewZMat</strong> utility. After selecting this
option, you designate the file to be converted from the <strong>Open File</strong> dialog
box. The <strong>NewZMat File Conversion</strong> window then appears (described
later in this document).</p>
<p><strong>CubeGen</strong> <br />
Generate a cube file for use in a visualization program. You will be prompted
for all necessary information.</p>
<p><strong>CubMan </strong><br />
Manipulate or transform one or more existing cube files. You will be prompted
for all necessary information.</p>
<p><strong>FreqChk </strong><br />
Retrieve frequency and thermochemistry data from a checkpoint file. After selecting
this option, you designate the checkpoint file to be used with the <strong>Open
File</strong> dialog box.</p>
<p><strong>FormChk </strong><br />
Convert a binary checkpoint file to an formatted (ASCII) version. After selecting
this option, you designate the checkpoint file to be used with the <strong>Open
File</strong> dialog box.</p>
<p><strong>UnFchk </strong><br />
Convert a formatted checkpoint file back to its G09W binary format. After selecting
this option, you designate the checkpoint file to be used with the <strong>Open
File</strong> dialog box.</p>
<p><strong>ChkChk </strong><br />
Display information about the contents of a checkpoint file. After selecting
this option, you designate the checkpoint file to be used with the <strong>Open
File</strong> dialog box.</p>
<p><strong>C8609</strong> <br />
Convert checkpoint files between the current version and those for previous versions
of <em>Gaussian</em> for Windows. After selecting this option, you designate
the checkpoint file to be used with the <strong>Open File</strong> dialog box.</p>
<p><strong>External PDB Viewer</strong><br />
View the current molecular structure with an external PDB viewing program. The
program to use is specified in the preferences (described later in this document).</p>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The View Menu</font></h3>
<p>The <strong>View</strong> menu controls the appearance of the window and enables
you to invoke an external text editor. The default settings of the various display
options may also be controlled via preferences. The editing options also have
icon equivalents (described later in this section).</p>
<p><strong>Toolbar </strong><br />
Toggles the display of the toolbar portion of the window. When the toolbar is
visible, this item is checked. </p>
<p><strong>Processing Output </strong><br />
Toggles the display of the <strong>Output Display</strong> area of the window.
When the <strong>Output Display</strong> area is visible, this item is checked.</p>
<p><strong>Status Bar</strong><br />
Toggles the display of the status bar portion of the window, which shows a brief
description of the current menu item. When the status bar is visible, this item
is checked.</p>
<p><strong>Editor</strong> <br />
Invoke the external editor (which editor is used is defined in the preferences).</p>
<p><strong><a name="examine" id="examine"></a>Editor &rarr; Output File</strong><br />
Invoke the external editor on the current output file. Note that an executing
job must be paused before invoking an editor on its output file.</p>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Help Menu</font></h3>
<p>The <strong>Help</strong> menu follows standard Windows conventions.</p>
<p><strong>Contents</strong><br />
Display the table of contents for the on-line help.</p>
<p><strong>About... </strong><br />
Display an informational window about this version and copy of <em>Gaussian 09W</em>,
including the program version and the serial number of this copy:</p>

<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="drag_drop" id="drag_drop"></a>Drag-and-Drop
File Execution</font></h3>
<p><em>Gaussian 09W</em> jobs may also be initiated using the drag-and-drop execution
technique. Here are the steps involved:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start <em>Gaussian 09W</em> (if necessary).</li>
<li>Browse to the directory containing the desired input file(s).</li>
<li>Select and drag the files onto the <em>Gaussian 09W</em> icon (if the program
is minimized) or anywhere within the <strong>Job Processing</strong> window.
If more than one file is dragged and dropped, a batch file consisting of the
selected input files will be created. The resulting batch control file will be
named <strong>DropList.BCF</strong>, and it will be placed in the current directory.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Begin Processing</strong> from the <strong>Process</strong> menu
(or click on the equivalent icon). You can direct <em>Gaussian 09W</em> to automatically
begin processing files that are dropped in the <strong>Process Preferences</strong> window
(described later).</li>
</ul>
