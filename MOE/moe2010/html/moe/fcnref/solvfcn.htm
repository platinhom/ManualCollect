<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
The purpose of the Solvate application is to add solvent molecules to a
molecular system, typically prior to a molecular dynamics simulation. 
Solvation is performed by replicating pre-calculated periodic systems of
solvent molecules.  The file format for these pre-calculated systems is a
modified SD file format with file extension <tt>.box</tt>.
The first line in the file must be:
<pre>
#moe:solventbox
</pre>
Following this is
an SD file record that ends with <tt>$$$$</tt>.  
The record consists of a connection table, which
defines a single solvent molecule using 2D depiction
coordinates, followed by data fields of which four are
specific to the solvent format.
The connection table molecule name is interpreted
as the residue name.
Two of the format-related data fields specify
the solvent name and SMARTS pattern for a single solvent molecule.
The other two
fields give the periodic cell parameters
and the total solvent molecule count for the periodic system.
Other data fields may be present.
3D coordinate data for the solvent molecules populating the
periodic system follow the end of record marker (<tt>$$$$</tt>).
</p>

<p>
The following is an example file.  The connection table name, and
hence, residue name,
is <tt>HOH</tt>.  The solvent name is <tt>Water</tt>, and
SMARTS pattern, <tt>[OX2H2Q0]</tt>.  A total of 216 solvent
molecules are found in the periodic system with cell parameters
given in the <tt>cell</tt> data field.  The 3D coordinate data
of the 216 water molecules are found at the end of the file.

<p>
The <tt>$MOE/lib/solvent</tt> directory contains the prepared
MOE solvent boxes used by the Solvate application.
To use another solvent requires that an appropriate solvent
file be created (e.g. with <tt>SolventWrite</tt>).
</p>

<p><a name="Solvate"></a></p>
<p><a name="SolventList"></a></p>
<p><hr noshade></p>
<pre>
tokens = <span class="fcndef">SolventList</span> []
<span class="fcndef">Solvate</span> [atoms, opt]
</pre>

<p>
The <tt>SolventList</tt> function returns a vector of tokens containing
the names of the solvents in the <tt>$MOE/lib/solvent</tt> directory.
The names are the molecule names and not the file names.
These names are used for specifying the solvent (with the <tt>solvent</tt>
option) when calling <tt>Solvate</tt>.

<p>
The <tt>Solvate</tt> command adds solvent molecules to the current system
with the given <tt>atoms</tt> vector containing the atom keys of the solute.
Although the entire system is considered in the calculation,
the solute atoms are used to determine orientation and extents of
solvation.
The solvent molecule, geometry and other options are specified in the
argument tagged vector <tt>opt</tt>.
Solvent molecules are added to the current molecular system using the
following steps.

<ol>
<li><b>Delete</b>.
Optionally, distant (no atom less than 4.0&nbsp;&Aring; from the solute) or all
of the existing solvent molecules in the system are deleted.  Candidate
solvent molecules are those defined by the chosen solvent and those defined
by the <b>MOE&nbsp;|&nbsp;Selection&nbsp;|&nbsp;Solvent</b> command.
<p>
<li><b>Transform</b>.
Optionally, <i>all of the atoms</i> in the current system are transformed
by a rigid body rotation and translation so that the solute center of mass
is at the orgin and principal mass moments are aligned to the
<i>x</i>-, <i>y</i>- and <i>z</i>-axes.
<p>
<li><b>Neutralize</b>.
Optionally, salt counter-ions are added to neutralize the system.  The
smallest number of counter-ions are added to achieve neutrality; they are
placed sequentially at energetically optimal locations.
<p>
<li><b>Read Solvent</b>.
One of the precalculated periodic solvent files in <tt>$MOE/lib/solvent</tt>
or a supplied solvent file is read and replicated so as to cover all
of the atoms in the system plus a specified margin.
<p>
<li><b>Remove Clashes</b>.
Solvent molecules that clash with atoms in the system are deleted as are
solvent molecules outside the droplet or solvent layer (if specified).
If the system is periodic, certain solvent molecules are removed to
reduce clashes due to periodicity (see below).
<p>
<li><b>Update Parameters</b>.
Optionally, update the Crystal Parameters (for periodic systems) or
the Wall Restraint (for droplets) to reflect the solvated geometry:
sphere, ellipse, box, cube, etc.
</ol>

<p>
The argument tagged vector <tt>opt</tt> may contain the following.

<blockquote><dl>
<dt><tt>mode :</tt> <i>token</i>
<dd>
Specifies the fundamental solvation geometry and can be one of
<tt>'Droplet'</tt>, <tt>'Layer'</tt> or <tt>'Periodic'</tt>.
Droplet creates a walled collection of solvent; Layer adds solvent that
contours a solute; Periodic creates a periodic cell of solvent (e.g.
for dynamics simulations).
The default is <tt>'Droplet'</tt>.
<p>
<dt><tt>shape :</tt> <i>token</i>
<dd>
Specifies the particular shape of the solvent.  For <tt>Droplet</tt> mode, the
legal values are <tt>'Sphere'</tt>, <tt>'Ellipse'</tt>, <tt>'Cube'</tt>,
<tt>'Box'</tt> and <tt>'Wall'</tt>.  <tt>Wall</tt> fills the current
Wall Restraint in the Potential Setup with solvent; the other shapes
are derived from the solute.  For <tt>Layer</tt> mode, the <tt>shape</tt>
value is ignored.  For <tt>Periodic</tt> mode, the legal values are
<tt>'Cube'</tt>, <tt>'Box'</tt> and <tt>'Crystal'</tt>.  <tt>Crystal</tt>
fills the current Crystal Parameters cell with solvent; the other
shapes are derived from the solute.
The default is <tt>'Sphere'</tt> (for default <tt>Droplet</tt> mode).
<p>
<dt><tt>margin :</tt> <i>num</i>
<dd>
The solute dimensions plus the <tt>margin</tt> are used to generate a
volume into which solvent will be added.  Measuring from the solute center
of mass, the largest radial distance is used for <tt>Cube</tt> and
<tt>Sphere</tt> while the largest Cartesian coordinate magnitude is used
along each axis for <tt>Box</tt> and <tt>Ellipse</tt>.  The value of
<tt>margin</tt> is added to the measured dimensions to arrive at either
a single radius or (half edge-length) for <tt>Sphere</tt> (<tt>Cube</tt>)
or three similar per-axis values for <tt>Ellipse</tt> (<tt>Box</tt>).
The value of margin should be at least half the non-bonded Potential cutoff
for periodic simulations.
The default is 6.0&nbsp;&Aring;.
<p>
<dt><tt>solvent :</tt> <i>token</i>
<dd>
The given <i>token</i> specifies the solvent to use.  Normally, this value
is one of the solvent names (not filenames) in the <tt>$MOE/lib/solvent</tt>
directory; i.e. one of the values returned by <tt>SolventList</tt>.
If the given token is not one of the solvent names then it
is taken to be the name of a modified SD solvent file as described
<a href="#solvent_file_format">above</a>.
The default is <tt>'Water'</tt>.
<p>
<dt><tt>salt :</tt> <i>token</i>
<dd>
Specifies the salt ions to use as counter-ions to neutralize the system.
A value of <tt>''</tt> will disable system neutralization.  Otherwise, the
token is taken to be the chemical formula of a salt with monatomic
ions; e.g. NaCl, KCl, CaCl2, etc.  A minimum number of ions is added
to achieve neutrality.
The default is <tt>''</tt>.
<p>
<dt><tt>delete :</tt> <i>token</i>
<dd>
If the given value is <tt>'all'</tt> then all solvent molecules existing
in the system are deleted; this includes molecules and counter-ions that
may be different from the specified <tt>solvent</tt>.  If the given value
is <tt>'far'</tt> then only those solvent molecules with no atom closer
than 4.0&nbsp;&Aring; from the solute atoms are deleted.  Otherwise
nothing is deleted.
The default is <tt>''</tt>.
<p>
<dt><tt>center :</tt> <i>flag</i>
<dd>
If <i>flag</i> is non-zero then <i>all atoms</i> are translated so that the
center of mass of <tt>atoms</tt> is at the origin.  Fixed atoms are
temporarily unfixed and then re-fixed.  Atom tethers are translated.
The default is 0.
<p>
<dt><tt>align :</tt> <i>flag</i>
<dd>
If <i>flag</i> is non-zero then <i>all atoms</i> are rotated so that the
principal mass moments of <tt>atoms</tt> are aligned with the <i>x</i>,
<i>y</i> and <i>z</i> axes.  Fixed atoms are temporarily unfixed and
then re-fixed.  Atom tethers are rotated.
The default is 0.
<p>
<dt><tt>updatePotential :</tt> <i>flag</i>
<dd>
If <i>flag</i> is non-zero then the Wall Parameters (for Droplets) or the
Crystal Parameters (for Periodic) solvations are updated to reflect the
new system volume.  In addition, the Wall flags for the atoms will be updated
so that atoms in the new Wall have their wall flags set.
The default is 1.
<p>
<dt><tt>clashCutoff :</tt> <i>num</i>
<dd>
The interaction energy (in kcal/mol) per solvent atom above which candidate
solvent molecules will be removed.  This value is used to remove solvent
that clashes with existing atoms or with other solvent in periodic conditions.
The default is 10.0&nbsp;kcal/mol.
<p>
<dt><tt>wallForce :</tt> <i>num</i>
<dd>
The force constant to use for the Wall Restraint in droplet solvations.
The default is 100.0&nbsp;kcal/mol.
<p>
<dt><tt>add_H :</tt> <i>flag</i>
<dd>
If <i>flag</i> is non-zero then hydrogens will be added to the system
with <tt>Add_H</tt>.  The default is 1.
<p>
<dt><tt>verbose :</tt> <i>flag</i>
<dd>
If <i>flag</i> is non-zero then information will be written to the SVL
Commands window during the calculation.  The default is 0.
</dl></blockquote>

<p>
For example, to solvate a system prior to periodic molecular dynamics
including the addition of counter-ions to neutralize the system:

<blockquote><pre>
Solvate [Atoms[], [
    solvent ; 'Water',
    salt    : 'NaCl',
    margin  : 6.0,
    center  : 1,
    align   : 1,
    verbose : 1
]];
</pre></blockquote>

<p><a name="SolventWrite"></a></p>
<p><a name="SolventOpen"></a></p>
<p><hr noshade></p>
<pre>
<span class="fcndef">SolventOpen</span>  filename
<span class="fcndef">SolventWrite</span> filename
</pre>

<p>
The <tt>SolventOpen</tt> function reads a solvent file in the format
described above and loads it into the current system.  The Cell Parameters
are updated to those contained in the file.
The <tt>SovlentWrite</tt> function writes the current system as a solvent
file.  It is assumed that the system is a periodic solvent system and that
the current Cell Parameters are valid.  The SMARTS pattern is detected
from the contents of the system which is assumed to contain only one
kind of molecule.  To create a new solvent file:
<ol>
<li>Create a periodic system containing a single kind of molecule.
<li>Perform an NVT molecular dynamics simulation.
<li>Set the chain name to the solvent name.
<li>Use the Crystal Parameters to build the system in Molecule mode.
<li>Use <tt>SolventWrite</tt> to save the file.
<li>Edit the saved file with a text editor to verify the SMARTS pattern,
residue name and other fields.
</ol>
