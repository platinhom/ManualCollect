<p>
The Builder is used to build or edit organic molecules, primarily in 3D.
Typical uses of the builder include correcting molecules read in from
files and building molecules for further calculations such as
conformational analysis, QSAR, docking and combinatorial library design.
Although MOE provides a variety of tools for building and editing
molecules (such as the
<a href="../../proteins/protool.htm">Protein Builder</a>,
<a href="../../apps/carbo.htm">Carbohydrate Builder</a>,
or Copy and Paste from 2D Sketchers like ChemDraw, IsisDraw, SymyxDraw),
this chapter concerns itself with the Builder, which can be run using
<b>MOE&nbsp;|&nbsp;Edit&nbsp;|&nbsp;Build&nbsp;|&nbsp;Molecule</b> or the
<b>Builder</b> button in the right button bar of the MOE Window.

<p>
Molecules are built or edited primarily by substituting atoms
(typically hydrogens).
The Builder operates on atoms selected in the MOE Window; i.e.,
select atoms <i>first</i> then operate on them with buttons in the Builder.
The functionality available in the Builder depends on which atoms are selected.
Some of the button labels turn blue to highlight the properties of
the selected atoms, such as element, ionization, chirality, etc.

<p>All Builder operations can be undone with <b>Undo</b>.  Undone operations
can be redone if <b>Redo</b> is pressed immediately following
the <b>Undo</b>.</p>

<p>For all operations, the number of hydrogens on the
atoms being operated upon is automatically adjusted to
satisfy valence requirements.</p>

<p>
Further editing of atoms and atomic geometry is provided in the
MOE Window <a href="../gui/mainwin.htm#Footer">footer</a>
which adapts to the current selection state.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note!</b> The Builder can be customized by using
<span class="menu">MOE | Window | Options | Builder</span>.
Some of the Builder controls (Atom name, Hybridization and SMILES) will
only appear in the Builder panel if they have been enabled.
</p>

<p>The Builder is written entirely in SVL and is thus
customizable. The Builder source code can be found in:
<span class="nobr"><tt>$MOE/lib/svl/run/builder.svl</tt>.</span>
</p>

<a name="CreateNewMolecule"></a>
<h2>Create New Molecule</h2>
<p>
To create a new molecule, ensure that there are no selected atoms in the
MOE Window (e.g. <span class="menu">MOE | Selection | Clear</span>);
then, in the Builder:
</p>
<p><table cellpadding="5">
<tr>
<td align="center"><img src="build/elements.jpg" alt="Elements" /></td>
<td valign="top">
Press an element symbol to create a new molecule containing the
selected element with hydrogens attached to fill valence.
Use <b>More</b> to access the full periodic table.
Use the pseudo-element Du to create a dummy atom.
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td align="center"><img src="build/ring.jpg" alt="Rings" /></td>
<td valign="top">
Press a ring symbol to create a new molecule consisting of the
selected ring.  The ring will be consist of all carbons with
attached hydrogens.  Rings not shown, or fused rings, can be built
by selecting the closest displayed ring and then changing bond orders,
elements or fusing more rings using the other Builder operations.
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td align="center"><img src="build/common.jpg" alt="Common" /></td>
<td valign="top">
Press a group symbol to create a new molecule consisting of the
selected functional group.  Hydrogens will be added to fill valence.
To build groups not shown, select the closest group and change
the elements and bond orders using the other Builder operations.
For example, to build thioamide, select an amide group <b>-CON</b> and
change the O to an S.
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td valign="top" align="center"><img src="build/smiles.jpg" alt="SMILES" /></td>
<td valign="top">
Enter (or paste) a valid <a href="smiles.html">SMILES string</a>
into the textfield, then press the happy face button.  This button
will be grayed (unhappy) when the SMILES string is not valid.
The given SMILES string
will be converted to 3D and hydrogens will be added to fill valence.
The most recently used strings are kept in the textfield pulldown.
The contents of this pulldown are remembered and automatically
loaded when the Builder is raised.
The first item in the list is <b>Copy from MOE</b> which enters
a SMILES string derived from the current atom selection in MOE.
The 3D coordinates are stored along with the SMILES string and
will be reproduced.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table></p>

<p>
New molecules will be created at the view point in the MOE Window.
For example, if there is a molecule centered in the view,
hold down <tt>Shift</tt> and drag the middle mouse button
to move the view to an unoccupied area of space before building
the new molecule.
Hydrogens will be added to fill valence, and one hydrogen will be selected
to serve as a subsequent substitution point.

<a name="AddGroup"></a>
<h2>Add Functional Group</h2>
<p>
The primary means of constructing molecules is by substitution of
terminal atoms, typically hydrogens.  Use the <b>Add&nbsp;H</b> button
to add hydrogens to hydrogen suppressed structures.
Heavy atoms (non-H, non-LP) with one heavy neighbor are also considered
terminal atoms for substitution purposes.
One or more terminal atoms can be selected and each will be substituted
with other groups:

<p><table cellpadding="5">
<tr>
<td align="center"><img src="build/elements.jpg" alt="Elements" /></td>
<td valign="top">
Each selected atom will be replaced with the chosen element.
Use <b>More</b> to access the full periodic table.
The Du pseudo-element is treated in a special way: if there is one atom
selected then it will be replaced with the LP pseudo-element;
if more that one atom is selected then a dummy atom will be created
at the centroid of the selected atoms.
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td align="center"><img src="build/ring.jpg" alt="Rings" /></td>
<td valign="top">
Each selected atom will be replaced with the chosen ring
structure (all carbons);  for example, pressing the benzene
ring will create a phenyl substituent.  If a selected heavy atom
is in a ring and has two heavy neighbors then a spiro ring will be created.
Rings not in the list can be created by selecting the closest
ring and then changing bonds or elements with the Builder.
Alternatively, SMILES can be input (see below).
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td align="center"><img src="build/common.jpg" alt="Common" /></td>
<td valign="top">
Each selected atom will be replaced with the chosen functional group;
for example, to add a carboxylic acid group, select a hydrogen and
press the <b>-CO2</b> button.
To substitute groups not shown, choose the closest group and change
the elements and bond orders using the other Builder operations.
For example, to add thioamide, chose the amide group <b>-CON</b> and
change the O to an S.
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td valign="top" align="center">
<img src="build/coord.jpg" alt="Coordination Atom" /></td>
<td valign="top">
To add coordinated atoms (e.g. in sulfones, sulfoxides, ylides),
select the heavy atoms onto which coordination atoms are to be added;
then press one of <b>=O</b>, <b>=S</b>, <b>=N</b> or <b>=C</b>.
Note that even though <b>=O</b> is pressed, the resulting molecule
will be created in charge-separated form; e.g. S=O will be
represented as [S+][O-] in MOE.
These buttons may also be used to create double bonded substituents;
for example, if a methyl carbon is selected, pressing <b>=O</b> will
result in an aldehyde.
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td valign="top" align="center"><img src="build/smiles.jpg" alt="SMILES" /></td>
<td valign="top">
Each selected atom will be replaced with the functional group
encoded by the given valid <a href="smiles.html">SMILES string</a>
when the happy face is pressed.
This button will be grayed (unhappy) when the SMILES string is not valid.
The given SMILES string
will be converted to 3D and hydrogens will be added to fill valence.
The root atom of the group is assumed to be the first heavy atom of the
SMILES string.
The most recently used strings are kept in the textfield pulldown.
The contents of this pulldown are remembered and automatically
loaded when the Builder is raised.
The first item in the list is <b>Copy from MOE</b> which enters
a SMILES string derived from the current atom selection in MOE.

</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table></p>

<a name="ChangeElement"></a>
<h2>Change Element</h2>
<p>
<div class="floatleft"><img src="build/elements.jpg" alt="Elements" /></div>
To change the element symbol of existing atoms, select the atoms in the
MOE Window and press an element button in the Builder.  Hydrogens will be
adjusted to satisfy valence requirements.  If the chosen element is
over-ligated then the ionization will be adjusted; e.g. a quaternary
carbon replaced by a nitrogen will become N+ and replacing a benzene
carbon with oxygen will result in O+.
</p><p>
Bond orders will be preserved for organic elements but changing an atom
to a metal will result in all single bonds (possibly affecting neighboring
atoms).
</p><p>
Use <b>More</b> for access to the full periodic table.
The Du pseudo-element is treated in a special way: if there is one atom
selected then it will be replaced with the LP pseudo-element;
if more that one atom is selected then a dummy atom will be created
at the centroid of the selected atoms.
</p>

<a name="ChangeAtomName"></a>
<h2>Change Atom Name</h2>
<p>
<div class="floatleft"><img src="build/aname.jpg" alt="Atom Name" /></div>
To change the name of an atom (not its symbol), select the atoms in the
MOE Window, then enter the atom name in the textfield and press Enter.
The Name pulldown contains attachment point names A0-A9 for use in
<a href="../../combi/cdgen.htm">combinatorial library generation</a>.
Atom names are limited to four characters; blanks will be
automatically stripped.
The <b>Sym</b> button replaces each selected atom's name with its
element symbol (the default).  The <b>Index</b> button replaces each
atom's name with its index in its residue.
</p><p>
Atom names can be displayed or hidden by turning on or off labels with
<span class="menu">MOE | Render | Atom Style</span>.  If one atom
is selected, then its name is displayed in the MOE Window footer.
</p><p>
<b>Note!</b> The Atom Name textfield will only appear in the Builder
if it is enabled in <span class="menu">MOE | Window | Options | Builder</span>.

<a name="ChangeIon"></a>
<h2>Change Ionization</h2>
<p>
<div class="floatleft"><img src="build/ion.jpg" alt="Ionization" /></div>
To change the ionization state of atoms, select them in the MOE Window
and press one of the formal charge buttons in the Builder.  Changing
the ionization of a hydrogen atom will change the ionization of the
attached heavy atom; for example, if the H in COOH is selected and
<b>-1</b> is pressed then carboxylate will result: CO[O-].  The Builder
will clamp ionizations to enforce reasonable values; for example, it is not
possible to neutralize a quaternary nitrogen, nor is it possible ionize
an atom below its valence electron count.

<a name="ChangeBond"></a>
<h2>Bond, Unbond and Bond Order</h2>
<p>
<div class="floatleft"><img src="build/bond.jpg" alt="Ionization" /></div>
To create a new bond, select two atoms that are not bonded and then
press the Single, Double or Triple bond buttons in the Builder.  These
buttons may be grayed out if valence does not permit a particular
bond order.
If disconnected fragments comprising separate residues are joined together,
the atoms may be combined into one residue provided no
receptor residues are involved.
</p><p>
To disconnect atoms, select them in the MOE Window and then press the
Unbond button (the button with the red X).  If more than one atom
is selected, then all bonds between selected atoms will be deleted.
Hydrogens will be adjusted to fill valence.  If the deletion of a
bond results in disconnected fragments, new residues will be created
to avoid having disconnected fragments in a single residue.
</p><p>
To change a bond order, select the two atoms on either side of the bond
(or click in the middle of the bond itself) and press the Single,
Double or Triple bond buttons in the Builder.  Double bonds creating
allenes are permitted only if exactly two atoms are selected.
Note that the ionization state of the atoms may change as a result of the
bond order change.
</p><p>
If more than two atoms are selected then the Single bond button will
change all bonds connecting selected atoms to single bonds.
If more than two atoms are selected then the Double and Triple bond
buttons will create the largest number of double or triple bonds 
along the bonds connecting the selected atoms (allenes will not be
created in such cases).  For example, selecting all of the carbons
in cyclohexane and pressing the Double bond button will result in benzene.

<a name="FuseRings"></a>
<h2>Fuse Rings</h2>
<p>
<table cellpadding="5">
<tr>
<td valign="top">
<img src="build/ring.jpg" alt="Ring Buttons" /></td>
<td valign="top">
To add a fused ring, select two bonded atoms in a ring and press one
of the ring buttons in the Builder.  If three atoms are selected then
the fused ring will contain the selected atoms; similarly for four
selected atoms.  Selecting two heavy atoms and two hydrogens is a good
way of controlling the resulting stereochemistry when fusing saturated rings.
Spiro rings can be created by selecting a single atom in a ring (with a
maximum of two heavy neighbors) then pressing one of the ring buttons.
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<a name="Delete"></a>
<h2>Delete, Undo and Redo</h2>
<p>
The <b>Delete</b> button deletes the selected atoms (and attached
hydrogens) and all bonds connecting them to other atoms.  Ionization
may be adjusted for the remaining atoms previously connected to the
deletion set (e.g. when deleting an oxygen in a sulfone).
Residues and chains that are emptied after the operation are also deleted.
In simple cases, if the deletion results in a disconnected residue then
the residue is split into multiple residues, one for each connected
component.
</p><p>
The <b>Undo</b> undoes operations performed by the Builder.  In general,
the state prior to the last Builder operation will be restored.
<b>Note!</b> If other MOE commands are performed then the <b>Undo</b>
will restore the state prior to the last Builder operation.
The <b>Redo</b> undoes the previous <b>Undo</b> operation.

<a name="Stereochemistry"></a>
<h2>Stereochemistry</h2>
<p>
<table cellpadding="5">
<tr>
<td valign="top">
<img src="build/stereo_s.jpg" alt="Ionization" /></td>
<td valign="top">
Press <b>R</b> (or <b>S</b>) to set the geometric chirality and chirality
constraint of the selected stereocenters to R (or <b>S</b>).
If a chiral center is selected in the MOE Window, the Builder stereochemistry
buttons will reflect its state.
<ul>
<li><font color="#00C000">Green</font>

<a name="ChangeTautomer"></a>
<h2>Change Tautomer</h2>
<table cellpadding="5">
<tr>
<td valign="top">
<img src="build/tautomer.jpg" alt="Tautomer" /></td>
<td valign="top">
The <b>Tautomer</b> button becomes active when there are alternative
tautomers for the selected atoms and nearby connected atoms.
For example, selecting the central carbon in NC=N structures such
as imidazole will generate tautomers for the imidazole ring.
(The <b>Tautomer</b> button will not be active if the selected atoms are
disconnected or too numerous.)
<p>
Press the <b>Tautomer</b> button to raise a collection of tautomeric
states.  The list will be truncated to the first few tautomers; select
fewer atoms to reduce the size of the list.  The first tautomer in the
list is always the current tautomer.
If one of these displayed tautomers is pressed then the atoms in the MOE
Window will be changed to the chosen tautomer.

button on the MOE Button Bar.  If
<a href="../../apps/ligx.htm#Properties">Ligand Properties</a> are enabled then
these properties will be updated upon completion of the energy minimization.
