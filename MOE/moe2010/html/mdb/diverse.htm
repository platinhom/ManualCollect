<p>The Diverse Subset application is used to select diverse subsets of compounds 
by ranking entries in a database based on their
distance from a reference set and from each other, using some 
diversity metric. The ranking order is used  
to extract a diverse subset of a user-specified size.
</p>

<a name="Methodology"></a>
<h2>Methodology</h2>

<p>
<p>
The MOE Diverse Subset application assigns a diversity ranking order to 
entries in a database.  The <i>N</i> reference set entries are all given 
a rank of 1. The diverse subset entries are given ranks 2 (highest rank)
to (<i>M</i>+1), where <i>M</i> is the number of diverse entries to be ranked,
as specified in the <b>Output Limit</b> option. 
The rank numbers are written to the database in a field named $DIVPRIO.
If the database has been clustered, Diverse Subset can be used to rank 
the entries in each cluster separately.  In this case the <i>N</i> reference set 
entries in each cluster are assigned the rank number of 1, with 
the diverse subset in each cluster assigned ranks 2 to (<i>M</i>+1). Since each cluster is ranked
separately, the same rank numbers can be assigned to diverse entries from 
different clusters.  

<p>
To choose the subset, Diverse Subset repeatedly chooses entries 
that are the farthest from both the <i>N</i> reference entries
and the currently-ranked entries. 
The calculation for determining which entry is the farthest 
is described <a href="#CalculatingDistance">below</a>.  
The ranking process stops when the number of entries ranked reaches
either the user-specified limit <b>Output Limit</b> (<i>M</i>), or
when all entries in the database have been ranked 
(when the <b>Output Limit</b> is set to 0).  
Any remaining unranked entries are all assigned the same rank <i>X</i>, 
where <i>X</i> is larger than any of the ranks already assigned.

<p>
The reference set is always the first <i>N</i> entries in the 
database, if no cluster field is specified, or the first <i>N</i>
entries in each cluster, if a cluster field is specified. The number 
of reference compounds, <i>N</i>, is specified in the <b>Seed Count</b>
option in the panel. Since the first <i>N</i> database entries are 
used as the reference set, the final rank orders will depend on the 
initial ordering of the entries in the database.  Thus, to prepare 
data for ranking, you should sort the database so that the <i>N</i> 
reference entries are the first <i>N</i> entries in the database
(if no cluster field is used) or so that the reference entries
are the first <i>N</i> entries in each cluster (if a cluster field 
is used).
</p>

<a name="CalculatingDistance"></a>
<h4>Determining the Farthest Entry</h4>

<p>
To determine which unranked entry is next to be ranked, 
the minimum of its distances between the ranked entries and the 
reference set are computed, and the entry with the largest such
minimum distance is deemed to be the farthest.

<p>
There are several ways to calculate the distance between two entries,
depending on the data used in the distance calculation:

<p>
<ol>
<li><a href="../quasar/descr.htm">Descriptors.</a> Suppose you have selected
<i>n</i> descriptor values (scalar numbers, e.g. QuaSAR
descriptors) for the distance calculation.  Then the distance between two
entries is calculated to be the Euclidean distance between their
corresponding points in <i>n</i>-dimensional descriptor space.

<p>
If descriptors span significantly different value ranges (e.g.
0.01 to 0.02 <i>vs.</i> -1000 to 1000), you can stipulate that the
descriptor values be first normalized to unit variance before distances
are calculated.

<p>
<li><a href="ph4intro.htm">Fingerprints.</a> Distance is calculated using a
similarity metric, such as the Tanimoto Coefficient.  You can choose from
any of the currently loaded similarity metrics.

<p>
<li><a href="../apps/confsrch.htm">Conformation Data.</a>
Distance is calculated as the root mean square distance (RMSD) between
a pair of molecular conformations.  You can specify whether to do an
optimal rigid-body superposition of the two conformations before
calculating their RMSD, and whether or not to include polar or hydrophobic
hydrogens in the calculation.

<p>
<b>Note:</b> Calculating distances using conformation data requires that
the database contain conformational data; i.e. all molecules
used for calculations must be conformations of the same molecule.

</ol>

<a name="RunningDiverseSubset"></a><h2>Running Diverse Subset</h2>

<p>
The following steps describe how to use Diverse Subset to rank a database,
and how to obtain a diverse subset of the database entries using the
resulting ranking.

<p>
<ol>
<p><li>
Open the database from which you wish to extract a
diverse subset.

<p><li>
Pre-process the database, if necessary.  Cluster the database if you want
to extract a diverse subset per data cluster.  Since the order of the
entries in the database determines the reference set (and hence the 
ranking order) sort the database so that the <i>N</i> reference
entries are the first <i>N</i> entries in the database. If 
a cluster field is used, the database should be sorted
so that the reference entries for each cluster are the 
first <i>N</i> entries in that cluster.


<p><li>Open the Diverse Subset panel from the Database Viewer using
<b><nobr>DBV | Compute | Diverse Subset</b></nobr>.

<p><li>
In the Diverse Subset panel, choose the <b>Method</b> by which the distance
between two database entries is to be calculated, i.e. using
Descriptors, Fingerprint data, or Conformation data.

<p><table>
<tr>
<td valign=top><b>Descriptors</b>
<td>When the method is descriptor, the option list will display all
numeric fields in the database. Select the names of the fields
to use in the calculation.

<tr>
<td valign=top><b>Fingerprint</b>
<td>You may choose any fingerprint type which is currently loaded in the
system.  Use <b>Set Fingerprint...</b> to change the value.  If the
database contains the chosen fingerprint as a field then this field will
be used.  If, however, the field does not exist in the database then you
must set the <b>Molecule</b> field to use for fingerprint calculation.

<tr>
<td valign=top><b>Conformation</b>
<td>Set the <b>Molecule</b> field from which to
obtain the conformations.
</table>

<p><li>
In the <b>Output Limit</b> field, specify the number of entries
to be ranked.  Zero indicates that all entries in the database are
to be ranked.


<p><li>
In the <b>Seed Count</b> field, specify the reference set size, <i>N</i>.

<p><li>
Specify a <b>Cluster Field</b> if you wish to calculate a diverse subset
per cluster.

<p><li>
Press OK.  Diverse Subset will rank the database entries and write out
the rank numbers to a field named $DIVPRIO.  Ranking may take some time
if the number of entries to be ranked is large.

<p><li>
Sort the database according to rank using <nobr><b>DBV | Compute | Sort</b></nobr> in
the Database Viewer.  If ranks have been calculated on a per-cluster
basis, use the cluster field as the highest priority (Priority 1) field in
the sort operation, and $DIVPRIO as the second.  This will result in
entries belonging to the same cluster appearing consecutively in the
database, ordered by rank within the cluster (1 being the ranks
given to the reference set entries).
</ol>

<h2>Diverse Subset Panel Reference</h2>

<p>This section describes the Diverse Subset panel, which is opened from
the Database Viewer using <nobr><b>DBV | Compute | Diverse Subset</b></nobr>.

<p><center><img src="diverse/diverse.png" alt="Diverse Subset Panel"></center>

<p><table width="100%" cellpadding=5>

<tr>
<td valign=top><b>Database</b>
<td valign=top>
Path and filename of the database on which to run the Diverse Subset
calculation.

<p>
If <b>Selected Entries Only</b> is on, only selected entries in the
Database Viewer are used in the calculation.  The rank numbers ($DIVPRIO
field values) of the unselected entries will be unaffected.  The default
is to use all entries.

<tr>
<td valign=top><b>Molecule</b>
<td valign=top>
Option menu containing a list of all the molecule fields in the database.

<p>
The molecule field is only used when the distance
calculation Method is set to Conformation, or when it is set to
Fingerprint and fingerprints are not already calculated in the database.

<tr>
<td valign=top><b>Output Limit</b>
<td valign=top>
Number of molecules to be ranked. Once the output limit has been reached,
the remaining entries are assigned a value that is larger than any of the
rankings that have already been assigned.  Zero means no limit;
<i>i.e</i>, all entries in the database are ranked.  If a cluster field is
specified, the specified limit is applied to every cluster.  The default
limit is 0.

<tr>
<td valign=top><b>Seed Count</b>
<td valign=top>
Number of entries (<i>N</i>) to use as the reference set. With no cluster
field, the first <i>N</i> entries will be used as the reference set.
If a cluster field is specified, the first <i>N</i> entries 
in each cluster will be used as the reference set for that 
cluster. Reference set compounds are given a rank of 1.


<tr>
<td valign=top><b>Cluster Field</b>
<td valign=top>
Option menu containing a list of all the numeric fields in the database. If no
cluster field is chosen, the entire database is treated as a single
cluster.  The default is none.

<tr>
<td valign=top><b>Method</b>
<td valign=top>
Method to use for calculating distance, determined by the data
used in the distance calculation.  The panel displays different options
for the different methods.  The default is Descriptors.

<tr>
<td valign=top><b>Descriptors</b>
<td valign=top>

The Options list displays the names of all the numeric fields in the
database.  If fields are selected, only they will be used in the
calculation. If none are selected, all will be used (except $DIVPRIO, if
it exists).  Descriptors must have been calculated beforehand
(e.g. using <nobr><b>DBV | Compute | Descriptors</b></nobr> in the Database
Viewer).

<p>
The <b>Normalize Descriptors to Unit Variance</b> option scales data in
the selected descriptor fields so that the variance of each field is 1.
Turn this option on if the descriptors used to calculate distance have
very different ranges of values.  The default is on.

<tr>
<td valign=top><b>Fingerprint</b>
<td valign=top>
<img src="diverse/finger.gif" align=right vspace=2>
The Options area reports the currently selected fingerprint and similarity
metric for distance calculations.  The fingerprints need not have been
calculated beforehand; Diverse Subset will calculate them from the
specified Molecule field.  Note that, in this case, fingerprint values are
not written to the database.

<p>Press <b>Set Fingerprint</b> to specify a different fingerprint or a different
similarity metric.  

<tr>
<td valign=top><b>Conformation</b>
<td valign=top>
This method can only be used on conformational databases, i.e.
databases in which all molecules in the field used for the calculations
are conformations of the same molecule.

<p><center><img src="diverse/conf.gif"></center>

<p>
If <b>Superpose Conformations Before Comparison</b> is turned on, MOE
performs an optimal rigid body superposition before calculating the RMSD.
If this option is not turned on, MOE compares the absolute coordinates of
the conformations.  The default is on.
