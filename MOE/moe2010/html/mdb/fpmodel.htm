<h2>Fingerprint Model</h2>
<hr noshade="noshade" />

<p>A fingerprint model is a fingerprint description of a set of
molecules.  The goal of the fingerprint model is to capture consensus
features of interest in the source data.  Fingerprints of all the molecules
in the source set are included in the model along with scoring criteria that
will determine how similar the fingerprint of a new molecule is to
those of the original set, collectively.

<p>Multi-fingerprint models can be created and saved using the
MOE-FingerprintModel panel.  The created models can in turn be
included in composite models using the 
<a href="../quasar/modcomp.htm">Model-Composer</a> or used directly in
<a href="../quasar/modcomp.htm">Model-Evaluate</a> or
<a href="../quasar/qcrsel.htm">QuaSAR-Reagent</a>.

<p>When evaluated, a fingerprint model will generate either a hit/miss
result (1 (hit) or 0), or a value in the range [0..1].  The fingerprint
being tested is compared to each fingerprint in the model using the specified
similarity metric.  The results of these comparisons are combined according
to the specified scoring function and the kind of result desired:

<p>
<ul>

<p>
<li><i>Hit or miss</i>.  For a hit to result, similarity and match
criteria must be satisfied.  The number of fingerprints whose similarity
exceeds the specified similarity threshold is tallied.  This count is then
tested against the minimum/maximum match limits to generate the final result.

<p>
<li><i>Value in [0..1]</i>.  The similarity scores resulting from
the comparisons of the test fingerprint against each
fingerprint in the model are combined using one of the arithmetic functions
<i>Minimum</i>, <i>Maximum</i>, <i>Average</i>, or <i>Distance</i>.

</ul>

<table border=0>
<tr><td class=panel><b>Source Database</b>

<td>Database containing fingerprint data.  The database must have
pre-calculated fingerprint fields.

<tr><td class=panel><b>Selected Entries Only</b>

<td>If on, only the fingerprints of the selected entries will be used in
the model, otherwise the fingerprints of all entries in the database will
be used.

<tr><td class=panel><b>Fingerprint Type</b>

<td>The option menu will contain the names of recognized fingerprint fields in
the database.  Note that the fingerprints in the fingerprint model must all be
of the same type.

<tr><td class=panel><b>Similarity Metric</b>

<td>The option menu will contain the names of the supported similarity metrics
for the selected fingerprint type.  The same similarity metric will be used for
all fingerprint comparisons when applying the model.

<tr><td class=panel><b>Score</b>

<td>The scoring function used to assess a molecular fingerprint (the "test
fingerprint") against the model.

<ul>
<p><li><b>Must Match</b>.  The required number of model fingerprints
that must be matched by the test fingerprint for a hit to result is
specified.  A match on an individual similarity comparison between the test
fingerprint and a model fingerprint is declared when the comparison yields
a value exceeding the overlap threshold.  The result of the Must Match
scoring calculation is a 1 (hit) or a 0 (miss).

<p> <ul>
    <li><b>All</b>.  The test fingerprint must match all of the fingerprints
	in the model file, to the cutoff level specified by the Overlap
	value.
    <li><b>At Least</b>.
    <b>At Most</b>. At least or at most the specified number of
    fingerprints in the model file must be matched by the test
    fingerprint.  The number of fingerprints can
    be expressed either as an absolute value or as a percentage.
    Percentages are indicated by suffixing the number with a percent
    sign (%).  No spaces are permitted between the number and the
    percent symbol, for example, <tt>25%</tt>.
    <li><b>None</b>.  The test fingerprint must not match any of the
	fingerprints in the model file.
    </ul>

<p><b>Overlap</b>. The percentage of similarity threshold
used to determine whether
the test fingerprint matches a given fingerprint in the model.

<p><li><b>Maximum.</b>  The maximum of the
individual similarity scores is output.

<p><li><b>Minimum.</b>  The minimum of the
individual similarity scores is output.

<p><li><b>Average.</b>  The average of the
individual similarity scores is output.

<p><li><b>Distance.</b>  The overall "distance" of the similarities,
calculated to be the square root of the
averaged sum of the squares, is output.

</ul>
