<a name="AtomsResiduesAndChains"></a>
<h2>Atoms, Residues and Chains</h2>

<p>Molecular systems in MOE are represented as a three-tiered molecular object
hierarchy: atoms are at the bottom level, residues at the middle, and
chains at the top. Every molecular object is identified by a unique key. </p>

<p>Start this tutorial by loading an aspirin molecule into MOE. 
In the MOE Window, choose <b>File&nbsp;|&nbsp;Open</b> and 
select <tt>asa.mol</tt> in the
<tt>$MOE/sample/mol</tt> directory.
</p>
<p>Next, at the SVL command line, type
(the use of &quot;<tt>svl&gt;</tt>&quot; is to indicate the CLI):
</p>
<pre>
    svl> Atoms[]
</pre>

<p>This returns the keys of all atom objects currently in the system. 
To view return values, open the SVL Commands window.
Similarly, <tt>Residues[]</tt> and <tt>Chains[]</tt> return the keys of all
residues and all chains in the system. </p>

<p>Suppose you only wish to operate on some of the objects in the system. In
the main window, select several atoms by pressing <tt>Shift</tt> as you click the 
left mouse button on atoms. You can now interrogate the system to find
out which atoms you selected using the <tt>aSelected</tt> function:</p>
<pre>
    svl> aSelected Atoms[]
</pre>

<p>This returns a mask with as many elements as there are atoms in the
system. The mask contain <tt>1</tt>'s for selected objects, and
<tt>0</tt>'s otherwise. <tt>rSelected</tt> and <tt>cSelected</tt> operate
similarly. Note that functions relating to atoms always begin with  
lowercase a, those relating to residues with lowercase r, and those relating
to chains with lowercase c.
</p>
<p>To obtain the keys of the selected atoms, use the extraction operator
<tt>|</tt>:
</p>
<pre>
    svl> Atoms[] | aSelected Atoms[]
</pre>

<p>Molecular objects can also be added to or removed from the selection set.
For instance, to set the first and third atoms in the list of atoms to be
selected and the second to be unselected, do the following:</p>

<pre>
    svl> a = Atoms[]
    svl> aSetSelected [[a(1),a(2),a(3)], [1,0,1]]
</pre>

<p>The return values in the SVL Commands window indicate the modified
selection states of atoms, as does the MOE Window in which new
atoms are selected. To clear atom selection, click away from the molecular
system.
</p>
<p>MOE also provides several prompting functions, which are useful for
allowing you to interactively pick molecule objects and have their keys
returned to you. At the CLI type:
</p>
<pre>
    svl> AtomPrompt[]
</pre>

<p>This raises a prompt in the MOE Window exhorting you to pick
an atom.  Similarly, <tt>ResiduePrompt</tt> and <tt>ChainPrompt</tt> will
prompt for residue and chain selection in the Sequence Editor. </p>

<p>Atoms, residues, and chains are related by parental-filial ties. Find the
residues to which two atoms belong by entering:
</p>
<pre>
    svl> oParent [a(1),a(2)]
</pre>

<p>Now find the child residues of the first chain in the system:</p>

<pre>
    svl> oChildren first Chains []
</pre>

<p>To find the chain to which an atom belongs, use: 
</p>
<pre>
    svl> aChain a
</pre>

<p>Conversely, to find the atoms belonging to a given chain, use
<tt>cAtoms</tt>. Similar functions exist for exploring atom-residue and
chain-residue relationships.</p>

<!-- SeeAlso
<p>Molecular Hierarchy for more on the molecular object hierarchy.</p>
-->

<a name="MolecularObjectProperties"></a>
<h2>Molecular Object Properties</h2>

<p>Each molecular object has associated properties that can be retrieved.
For instance, select any atoms and enter the following commands to find their
elements and names:
</p>
<pre>
    svl> atoms = Atoms [] | aSelected Atoms []
    svl> aElement atoms
    svl> aName atoms
</pre>

<p>You can easily change atom properties: 
</p>
<pre>
    svl> aSetElement [first atoms, 'N']
    svl> aSetBackbone [first atoms, 1] // mark as backbone
    svl> aSetGeometry [first atoms, 'sp2']
</pre>

<p><b>Note:</b> Text following the two forward slashes (<tt>//</tt>) 
is entered as a comment.
</p>
<p>In addition to fundamental atom properties, you can also examine and
modify molecular graph (connectivity) properties. For instance, to find the
atoms bonded to selected atom <tt>a</tt>:
</p>
<pre>
    svl> a = AtomPrompt[]
    svl> aBonds a
</pre>

<p>This returns a vector that looks something like this (because atom keys
are unique, your numbers will be different to those in this example):
</p>
<pre>
    [ [3871768,3872360,3877688] ]
</pre>

<p>The extra set of brackets indicates that what the return value is itself
a vector of vectors, i.e. a list of atom lists. 
This can be better appreciated if you invoke <tt>aBonds</tt>
to find the atoms bonded to two atoms, <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt>: 
</p>
<pre>
    svl> b = AtomPrompt[]
    svl> aBonds [a,b]
</pre>

<p>which returns a result similar to the following: 
</p>
<pre>
    [ [3871768,3872360,3877688], [3871176,3872064] ]
</pre>

<p>Note, however, that a vector of one number can be written as just that
number, without brackets, so that if atom <tt>a</tt> is bonded to only one
atom, <tt>aBonds a </tt>will return a single number. Try it by typing:
</p>
<pre>
    svl> aBonds AtomPrompt[]
</pre>

<p>and picking a hydrogen atom.</p>

<p>If atom <tt>b</tt> is also bonded to only one atom, then <tt>aBonds
[a,b]</tt> will return a vector of 2 numbers, e.g.
</p>
<pre>
    [3871768,3871176]
</pre>

<p>If you care specifically about the order of the bonds from atom
<tt>a</tt>, use:
</p>
<pre>
    svl> aBondOrder a
</pre>

<p>This function behaves identically to <tt>aBonds</tt> except that, instead
of returning the keys of the bonded-to atoms, it returns the bond order of
the corresponding bonds: 1 (single), 2 (double), or 3 (triple). Note that the
order in which the atom keys are returned by <tt>aBonds</tt> is exactly the
same as that in which the bond orders are returned. </p>

<p>A related function is <tt>bOrder</tt>. Just as <tt>a</tt> in
<tt>aBondOrder</tt> stood for atom, <tt>b</tt> stands for
bond. The <tt>bXXX</tt> functions operate on pairs of atoms, returning
information about the bond that connects them (if any). Experiment with the
following calls:
</p>
<pre>
    svl> bOrder [a,b] // report order of a-b bond
    1

    svl> bInRing [a,b] // is a-b bond in a ring?
    1

    svl> bInHRing [a,b] // is a-b bond in an aromatic ring?
    0
</pre>

<p>Now we'll look at some functions that change the display attributes of
atoms, in particular, the atom color commands:
</p>
<pre>
    svl> aColorBy AtomPrompt[]
    'element'
</pre>

<p>The default coloring scheme in MOE is by atom element. Let's color the entire
molecule in rainbow hues. We can accomplish this using the atom
&quot;scalar&quot; field, a number between <tt>0</tt> and <tt>1</tt>
associated with each atom.
</p>
<pre>
    svl> scalars = x_id Atoms[] / nAtoms[]
</pre>

<p>This generates atom indices from <tt>1</tt> to the number of atoms
(<tt>x_id</tt>), and normalizes them to between <tt>0</tt> and <tt>1</tt>.
</p>
<pre>
    svl> aSetScalar [Atoms[], scalars]
    svl> aSetColorBy [Atoms[], 'scalar'] // change coloring scheme
</pre>

<a name="MoleculeDataStructure"></a>
<h2>Molecule Data Structure (<tt>mdb</tt> Format)</h2>

<p>In MOE, molecules are frequently manipulated in molecular data structure
representation, also known as <tt>mdb</tt> (molecular database) format. This
compact representation contains all the information needed to reconstruct a
molecule, and is how molecules are formatted when reading molecules from or
writing molecules to databases, for instance. But the usage of this format is
not limited to database communication. For instance, we can use it to
duplicate the molecule that is currently loaded in MOE:
</p>
<pre>
    svl> mol = mol_Extract Atoms[]
</pre>

<p><tt>mol</tt> now contains an <tt>mdb</tt> representation of all the
molecular data in the system. Type:
</p>
<pre>
    svl> mol
</pre>

<p>to see the contents of the variable. <tt>mol</tt> is a vector of
<tt>4</tt> vectors. The last of these contains all the atom data needed to
reconstruct the atoms of the molecule, including atom positions. When we
create our copy of the molecule in MOE, we'll shift it slightly (by
<tt>3</tt>&Aring;) in the <em>Z</em> direction so it doesn't get created
exactly on top of the original.
</p>
<pre>
    svl> mol(4)(MOL_ATOM_Z) = mol(4)(MOL_ATOM_Z) + 3 // 3 angstrom shift
    svl> mol_Create mol	// returns key of new chain
</pre>

<a name="AFirstProgram"></a>
<h2>A First Program</h2>

<p>Our first program will be a small application to interactively select an
atom whose chirality is then inverted. Open the SVL Text Editor with
<span class="nobr"><b>MOE | File | New | TextEditor</b></span>, 
and enter the following lines of code:
</p>
<pre>
    function MM; // import function MM

    function main []
	local atom = AtomPrompt[];
	aSetForceRS [atom, neg aRSChirality atom];
	MM [gtest:0.5]; // coarse minimization
    endfunction
</pre>

<p><tt>aSetForceRS</tt> sets a chirality constraint on an atom, which is used
in energy minimization (<tt>MM</tt>). </p>

<p>Note that the function <tt>MM</tt> needs to be explicitly imported
whereas the function <tt>aSetForceRS</tt> is a <tt>built-in</tt> function
as is thus automatically imported.  For more information on the rules
of importing functions
see <a href="../svl/manual/funcs.html">Built-in versus Public Functions</a>
in the SVL manual.
</p>
<p>We can save and run this file in one step with 
<span class="nobr"><b>TextEditor | SVL | Save and Run</b></span>.
The first time you do this, a file selection box will appear requesting the
name of a file into which to save. In the MOE Window, click on a chiral
atom.</p>

<p>Note that if you want to invert the chirality of all the chiral atoms in a
molecule, you can use the following trick:
</p>
<pre>
    svl> aSetPos [Atoms[], neg aPos Atoms[]]
</pre>

<a name="ModifyingASampleProgram"></a>
<h2>Modifying a Sample Program</h2>

<p>MOE comes with a collection of applications in its <tt>$MOE/sample</tt>
directory.  These pieces of SVL code are for the most part implementations of
interesting algorithms found in the literature; there are also some tools. We
will modify the Velocity Verlet program as an illustration of how to go about
customizing the source code that is provided with the MOE distribution.</p>

<p>Copy <tt>$MOE/sample/verlet.svl</tt> to your own file, and edit it with
the SVL Text Editor. </p>

<p>Suppose we want to modify this code to perform Hoover-Nos&eacute;
constant-temperature equilibrium dynamics. First, we need to calculate the
instantaneous temperature <tt>iT</tt> with each iteration:
</p>
<pre>
    iT = (2/3) * K / (KBOLTZ * N);
</pre>

<p>where <tt>N</tt> is the number of atoms (that are free to move), and
<tt>K</tt> is the kinetic energy <em>&frac12;mv&sup2;</em>:
</p>
<pre>
    K = 0.5 * add (add sqr v * mass)
</pre>

<p>Then we need to introduce a constant-temperature friction coefficient
<tt>fT</tt>. The initial value of <tt>fT</tt> is zero, and is updated each
iteration as follows:
</p>
<pre>
    fT = fT + (iT - T) * dt / QT;
</pre>

<p>where <tt>iT</tt> is the instantaneous temperature as defined above,
<tt>T</tt> is the target temperature (entered by the user), and <tt>QT</tt>
is the temperature response, a constant value which for our purposes will be
set to 25 (<i>E</i>/ps<sup>2</sup>).
</p>
<p>Finally, the acceleration is modified by the friction coefficient:
</p>
<pre>
    a = a + (fT * dt) * v;
</pre>

<p>Make the appropriate modifications to the file for the code to look like
this (ignoring the window functions). The modified lines are marked by
"<span class="nobr"><b><tt>// ***</tt></b></span>":</p>

<pre>
    local atoms = Atoms [];
    local mass = aMass atoms;
    local v = randN rep [T*KBOLTZ/mass, 3]; // initial velocities
    v = v - app add (v * [mass]) / add mass; // remove lin. momentum

    local p = aPos atoms;
    local a = (Potential [X:p])(2) / [mass]; // F = ma

    local fT = 0;  	 		<b>// *** friction coefficient</b>
    const QT = 25; 	 		<b>// *** temperature response</b>
    local N = nAtoms []; 		<b>// *** assume none fixed</b>

    // velocity verlet integration loop

    loop
	p = p + v * dt - a * (sqr dt / 2);
	v = v - a * (dt / 2);
	a = (Potential [X:p])(2) / [mass];
	v = v - a * (dt / 2);

	a = a + (fT * dt) * v; 			<b>// ***</b>

	aSetPos [atoms, p]; // update positions

	local K = 0.5 * add (add sqr v * mass); <b>// ***</b>
	local iT = (2/3) * K / (KBOLTZ * N); 	<b>// *** inst. temp.</b>
	fT = fT + (iT - T) * dt / QT; 		<b>// ***</b>
    endloop
</pre>

<p>Once again, we can save and run directly from the SVL Text Editor (Save
and Run from the SVL menu). </p>


<a name="WritingAndDebuggingAnSVLProgram"></a>
<h2>Writing and Debugging an SVL Program</h2>

<p>An SVL program is a function or series of functions which are compiled and
loaded, and thereafter accessible at any time at the command line, or from
inside another function. A compiled and loaded program is known as an SVL
<i>module</i>. </p>

<p>An SVL program can be localized in a single ASCII file, or distributed
over several files, all of which can be edited by any text editor. You can
use any editor to create and edit an SVL file, but you may find editing in
the SVL Text Editor convenient for debugging.
</p>
<p>When beginning to write SVL programs, it is highly recommended that you
debug all lines of code at the command line. This will help reduce the number
of syntactical and logical errors in your code. At runtime, the Crash
History window is an effective tool for finding errors in your code. We will
illustrate the use of the Crash History below.  Compilation errors will be
flagged when loading the module. Modules can be loaded at the command line:
</p>
<pre>
    load 'filename'
</pre>

<p>where <tt>filename</tt> is supplied with single quotes. </p>

<p>Every SVL module has attributes that can be set with module environment
variables. The <tt>title</tt> variable specifies the name that appears in
the Modules and Tasks panel; the default is simply the filename. The
<tt>class</tt> variable is used to categorize modules. </p>

<p>The auto-import and entry-point variables will be discussed below in the
section on how to install your function. </p>

<!-- SeeAlso
<p>ModuleEnv for more on module environment.</p>
-->

<p>To illustrate the development of a program, we will create a function to
minimize an arbitrary protein.  We will save the program as an
SVL file and then debug and run it.
Open your favorite editor or use the SVL text editor.</p>

<blockquote>
    <b>Note:</b> We have deliberately introduced several errors in the
    code to demonstrate how bugs are reported, and how you should go about
    tracking them down and correcting them.  The lines containing errors
    are marked with &quot;<tt>!!!</tt>&quot;. See the examples below.
    Later we will save, debug, and run an SVL file.
</blockquote>


<p>Module environment variables must be set at the top of a file before any
code. Comments are permitted before environment variable settings. Recall
that there are two kinds of comments, one for multi-line comments
&quot;<span class="nobr"><tt>/* */</tt></span>&quot;, and the other for until-end-of-line
comments &quot;<tt>//</tt>&quot;. See this example:
</p>
<pre>
    // file: protmin.svl
    // desc: module for protein minimization

    #set title 'Protein Minimizer'
    #set class 'MOE:user'

    /* comment out a block of code for debugging 
    */
</pre>

<p>Some functions, such as <tt>Atoms</tt>
or <tt>aSetFixed</tt>, do not need to be declared. In general, it is safest
to declare all functions. If you obtain an error such as:
</p>
<pre>
    load: line n: Undeclared identifier 'function_name'
</pre>

<p>this indicates that either the function <tt>function_name</tt> is not
visible, either because it does not exist, or because it was not declared, or
that the function cannot be invoked without using its return value. For
instance, the statement:
</p>
<pre>
    1 + 1;
</pre>

<p>is illegal in an SVL function since it has no effect (it is do-nothing code).

<!-- SeeAlso
<p>(CompErr for more details.)
-->

However,
</p>
<pre>
    a = 1 + 1;
</pre>

<p>is legal. Type the following line to include the function declaration.
It is not necessary to type the comment (i.e. from <tt>//</tt> onwards).
</p>
<pre>
    function MM:	// import function MM <b>!!!Error 1</b>
</pre>

<p>Below is a function for calculating and reporting
the potential energy and gradient of the system. Note that since local
functions are only visible to functions within the file in which they are
defined, they are not callable from the command line. Thus, for the purposes
of debugging, you can make local functions global, and only when they run
satisfactorily should you assign them to be local (you should not leave them
as global because they will hog system resources unnecessarily). Note that
giving a global function the same name as that of one already loaded will
result in an error.
</p>
<pre>
    // GetPotGrad prints the potential and the
    // maximum gradient in each of the x,y,z directions.
    // Returns: all x,y,z gradients

    local function GetPotGrad []
	local [e,g] = Potential [[dX:1]];	// <b>!!!Error 2</b>
	write ['potential energy: {}, gradients: {}\n', e, app maxE g];
	return g;
    endfunction
</pre>

<p>Here is another local function for fixing atoms and then performing
minimization:
</p>
<pre>
    // FixMin fixes specified atoms, minimizes, then unfixes all.

    local function FixMin atomkeys
	aSetFixed [ atomkeys, 1 ];
	atomkeys;	// <b>!!!Error 3</b>
	MM []; // minimize with default parameters
	aSetFixed [ atomkeys, 0 ];
    endfunction
</pre>

<p>Below you will find a module containing the above functions, along
with the protein minimization function. Paste the contents into a text
file and save it to <tt>protmin.svl</tt>.
</p>
<pre>
#svl
//	protmin.svl	Protein Minimization
//
//	10-oct-2008 (nt) created
//
// Description: Runnable file for minimizing proteins.
//	Be sure to set appropriate forcefield first.

#set title 'Protein Minimizer'
#set class 'MOE:user'
#set main ProteinMinimize

/* This kind of comment is good for commenting out
** a block of code for debugging purposes.
**/

function MM:	// !!!Error 1

// GetPotGrad prints the potential and the
// maximum gradient in each of the x,y,z directions.
// Returns: all x,y,z gradients

local function GetPotGrad []
    local [e,g] = Potential [[dX:1]];	// !!!Error 2
    write ['potential energy: {}, gradients: {}\n', e, app maxE g];
    return g;
endfunction

// FixMin fixes specified atoms, minimizes, then unfixes all.

local function FixMin atomkeys
    aSetFixed [ atomkeys, 1 ];
    atomkeys;	// !!!Error 3
    MM []; // minimize with default parameters
    aSetFixed [ atomkeys, 0 ];
endfunction

//  ProteinMinimize minimizes in several steps:
//	1) Fix backbone atoms, minimize
//	2) Fix aC, minimize
//	3) Minimize only higher gradient areas
//	4) Minimize all

global function ProteinMinimize protname
    Open protname; // protname must be token
    aSetFixed [ Atoms[], 1 ]; // fix original atoms
    Add_H Atoms[];
    write 'Minimize only hydrogens...';
    MM []; // minimize with default parameters
    aSetFixed [ Atoms[], 0 ];

    GetPotGrad []; // report energy, gradient

    write 'Minimize with backbone atoms fixed...';
    FixMin (Atoms[]|aBackbone Atoms[]);

    write 'Minimize with alpha-Carbons fixed...';
    FixMin (Atoms[]|((aName Atoms[])=='CA'));

    write 'Minimize higher gradient areas...';

    local g = GetPotGrad [];
    FixMin (Atoms[]|(sqrt add sqr g &gt; 1));	// !!!Error 4

    write 'Minimize all...';
    MM [ method:'TN', gtest:0.01, maxit:1000 ];
    GetPotGrad [];
endfunction
</pre>

<p>Delete any atoms in MOE (MOE | File | Close) and, from the SVL Text Editor, save and load the module directly with the
<span class="nobr"><b>SVL | Save and Load</b></span> command. 
(From the CLI, load modules with the <tt>load</tt> command.) </p>

<p>If the directory in which the file is found is not the same as that from
which you invoked MOE, and is not included in your <tt>MOE_SVL_LOAD</tt>
environment variable (see the next section) use the full directory path with
the file name. </p>

<p><b>Error 1:</b></p>

<p>When you loaded the file, a load time (compiler) error will have been
raised. The error message in the error box gives the line in the source code
on which the error occurred. In this case, we have a syntax error. Go back to
your text editor and on the line marked by <tt>!!!Error 1</tt>, change the colon
(<tt>:</tt>) following <tt>MM</tt> to a semicolon (<tt>;</tt>) to get:
</p>
<pre>
    function MM;
</pre>

<p><b>Error 3:</b></p>

<p>Try loading again. This time, we get another error. This one is not
a syntax error.  Rather, it is caused by an expression, in this case
<tt>atomkeys</tt>, having no effect. Remove the line marked by <tt>!!!Error
3</tt>, or comment it out with <tt>//</tt>. Load the module once again. You
should be successful.  Now run the module on the biotin receptor by entering
the following at the CLI:
</p>
<pre>
    ProteinMinimize '$MOE/sample/mol/biotin_rec.moe'
</pre>

<p><b>Error 2:</b></p>

<p>The line marked by <tt>!!!Error 2</tt>, did not generate a compiler error;
instead, it raises an error here at runtime. Open the Crash History window
<span class="nobr">(<b>MOE | Window | Crash History</b>)</span>.  
Observe how the error information is supplied in
this window - the line containing the error is displayed, its line
number and calling function is given, along with the function calling
sequence. Experiment with moving up and down in the function call tree,
either with the mouse left button or with the keyboard arrow keys, in the
lower list box.  Note how, at each calling level, the pertinent line of code
is highlighted. Change the line to read:
</p>
<pre>
    local [e,g] = Potential [ dX:1 ];
</pre>

<p>Close the file <span class="nobr">(<b>MOE | File | Close</b>)</span> and run the module
once again.</p>

<p><b>Error 4:</b></p>

<p>The last error we introduced was a logical error. On the line marked by
<tt>!!!Error 4</tt>, the &gt; symbol should have been a &lt; symbol. Such errors
can be difficult to spot. In this case, we might be tipped off by
higher-than-expected gradient values when <tt>MM</tt> begins minimizing.
Debugging code at the command line before writing it into a program can
help avoid such errors.</p>

<p>Functions can be installed in MOE simply by loading them at the command
line with the load command. However, user functions can also be loaded
automatically when MOE starts up.  The <tt>MOE_SVL_LOAD</tt> environment
variable contains a list of directories which are searched for <tt>.svl</tt>
files. By default, all directories carrying the <tt>.svl</tt> extension
(e.g. directory <tt>test.svl</tt>) are also searched. Matching files
are loaded automatically. The directory list is read from left to right, so
earlier files supersede later ones. Files generating compiler errors or
conflicts with MOE and SVL built-in functions will not be loaded. </p>

<p>When MOE is already running, files located in a <tt>MOE_SVL_LOAD</tt>
directory can be loaded without having to include a full directory path. MOE
will search the current directory (the directory from which MOE was invoked,
or the directory specified using the change directory command <tt>cd</tt>) 
for the specified file, and, if the file is not found, it
will search the <tt>MOE_SVL_LOAD</tt> directories. </p>

<p>Loaded files are managed by an SVL subsystem called the Module Manager for
which the SVL Modules &amp; Tasks window 
<span class="nobr">(<b>MOE | Window | Modules &amp; Tasks</b>)</span> is a
graphical interface. The Modules page of this window lists loaded modules by
module class (optionally specified in the program file using the

<span class="nobr"><tt>#set class</tt></span>

directive; default class is general). The module <tt>title</tt>
(set in the program file using the

<span class="nobr"><tt>#set title</tt></span>

directive; default title is the file name) is displayed in the list. Use the
module title when specifying a module to unload. </p>

<h2>How To Run Your Function Without <tt>load</tt></h2>

<p>You can run your function directly without having to load it first by
setting an entry point using a module environment variable as follows:
</p>
<pre>
    #set main 'function'
</pre>

<p>where <tt>function</tt> is the name of the function to execute. This
variable must be set at the very top of the file; only comments may precede
it. At the CLI, type:
</p>
<pre>
    run 'filename'
</pre>

<p>To pass arguments to main, type: </p>

<pre>
    run [ 'filename.svl', arguments_to_main ]
</pre>

<p>This will cause the module to load and run. If no

<span class="nobr"><tt>#set main</tt></span>

variable is present in a file, the default entry point is a function called
<tt>main</tt>.</p>

<p>In the example above, the module has <tt>main</tt> set to
<tt>ProteinMinimize</tt>.  The file can be run as follows
(the use of &quot;<tt>svl&gt;</tt>&quot; is to indicate the CLI):
</p>
<pre>
    svl&gt; run ['protmin.svl', '$MOE/sample/mol/biotin_rec.moe']
</pre>
