<p>For an illustration of widgets and their attributes, run 
<tt>$MOE/sample/windemo.svl</tt>. This loads the SVL Window Demo panel, 
which allows you to view window objects (referred to as <i>widgets</i>)
as well as their general and specific attributes.
</p>
<p>For more detailed information on windows and widgets, see the
<a href="../svl/svlgui/wt_intro.htm"> Toolkit Reference</a>.
</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> The graphical user interface panels and tools are not
available in batch mode.
</p>
<a name="BeforeYouBegin"></a><h2>Before You Begin</h2>

<p>To profit most from this tutorial, we suggest you
type in each example using a text editor. This will allow you to experiment 
with the various widgets and view the effects obtained on screen.
</p>

<p>
If you use the
<a href="../moe/gui/ted.html">SVL Text Editor</a>,
first save the file using <span class="menu">TED | File | Save As</span>.  A
file selection box will appear, prompting for the name of a file into which
to save.  Type the name in the <b>Path</b> field and press <b>OK</b>
(it is recommended to use <tt>.svl</tt> as the file extension).
Once you have specified the filename in this way, you can subsequently save
any modifications to the file and at the same time load the file using
<span class="menu">TED | SVL | Save and Load</span>.
With the file loaded, you can
run your function by typing the function name at the CLI.
</p>

<p>If you are using another text editor, save the code in a file,
load it into the application with the <tt>load</tt>
command, and run the function by typing the function name at the CLI.
</p>
<p>Throughout this tutorial we will assume you are using the SVL Text
Editor.
</p>

<p><b>Important!</b> Be scrupulous about entering punctuation: 
brackets, commas, colons, and semi-colons.
</p>

<h2><a name="CreatingAMessageBox"></a>Creating a Message Box</h2>

<p>You will begin by creating a YesNo box.  This is a simple dialog
used to ask a question to the user and force an answer 
before continuing. This is known as a <i>modal</i> dialog because
the application remains "blocked" until the question is acknowledged.
You answer a modal question by pressing <tt>Return</tt> or <tt>Esc</tt> in 
<b>any </b>of the windows belonging to the application. 
This activates the default button or cancels the query. When a modal query 
is active, the application cursor changes shape. There are several other 
modal queries: <tt>OKCancel</tt>, <tt>Warning</tt>, <tt>NoYes</tt> 
and <tt>YesNoCancel</tt>. In each case, the user must respond in order 
to "unblock" the application.
</p>
<p>To create a YesNo message box, enter the following lines of code: 
</p>
<pre>
    function ModalExample []
	local val;
	val = YesNo 'Hello world';
	write [
	    'Continuing execution.\n'
	    'Return value: {}\n', val
	]; 
    endfunction
</pre>


<p>Save and load the file. If no syntax error is detected, 
enter the following command at the CLI:
</p>
<pre>
    svl&gt; ModalExample []
</pre>


<p>A message box with the text <b>Hello world</b> appears. 
The application blocks and prevents any input from any of the application
windows until you press the Yes or No button or press the <tt>Return</tt> or
<tt>Esc</tt> keys.
</p>
<p>Once acknowledged, the warning function returns and execution continues at
the write statement. The output of the write can be seen in the SVL
Commands window.
</p>
<h2><a name="CreatingASimplePanel"></a>Creating a Simple Panel</h2>

<p>You will now create a small panel that displays a message and
waits for user input. This is a <i>non-modal</i> panel because it 
will not block the application.
</p>

<p>Enter the following code: 
</p>
<pre>
    global function HelloWorld []
	const PANEL = [ 		 //panel descriptor
	    title : 'My Panel',
	    Label : [ text : 'Hello world!' ]
	];

	WindowPrompt [PANEL, []];	 // put up panel
	write 'Continuing execution.\n'; // after ok pressed
    endfunction
</pre>

<p>This specifies a <i>panel descriptor</i> and assigns it
to a constant named <tt>PANEL</tt>. In general, constant names are in
capital letters to distinguish them from variable names.
</p>
<p>The <tt>WindowPrompt</tt> function automatically puts
the OK and Cancel buttons in the window. Since the panel is non-modal, 
you may continue working in other windows
even though the panel remains on screen.
</p>
<p>Save and load the file. To invoke the function, enter the 
following command at the CLI:
</p>
<pre>
    svl&gt; HelloWorld []
</pre>



<p> Press the OK button to return from the <tt>WindowPrompt</tt>
function call. Open the SVL Commands window
to see the text of the write statement.
Pressing Cancel terminates the task, 
and the write statement is not executed.
</p>
<p>Reopen the panel and press the <tt>Return</tt> key, instead of the OK
button. Nothing happens because <tt>Return</tt> is
not associated with a default action.  Pressing <tt>Return</tt> in a panel 
created with <tt>WindowPrompt</tt> produces no default action.  Compare
this with the YesNo dialog where pressing <tt>Return</tt> causes the
default action to take effect.
</p>

<a name="GettingWidgetValues"></a><h2>Getting Widget Values</h2>

<p>You will now create a new panel with two data entry fields and
retrieve the information typed by the user.
</p>
<p>Create the following panel descriptor:
</p>
<pre>
    global function GetValues []
       const PANEL = [
           title : 'Example',
           Text : [		// default data type is 'char'
              name: 'name',     // text field identifier
              title : 'Name:'	// text field label
           ],
           Text : [
              name: 'age',	// text field identifier
              title : 'Age:',	// text field label
              type: 'int'	// expected data type
           ]
       ];

       local values = WindowPrompt [PANEL, []];
       write ['Panel values: ']; print values;
       write ['Hello {}. You are {} years old.\n', 
	       values.name,values.age];
    endfunction

</pre>

<p>Save and load the file. 
</p>
<p>To invoke the panel, enter <tt>GetValues []</tt> at the CLI. 
</p>

<p>The panel now includes two text fields: the first ('Name') is a 'char'
data type, the second ('Age') is an 'int' data type. The 'int' type
accepts only numeric input in the text field.
Fill in both fields and
press OK.  This causes the panel to return the
values of its widgets; in this case, the text typed in the fields. 
The output of the write statement is printed in the SVL Commands window.
</p>
<p>Most widget objects have a trigger, an action which
causes the interface to respond to user input. For a button, the
trigger is a button press; for a toggle, it is
changing the toggle state; for a list, it is changing the selection state.
</p>

<p>Now you will add another widget. To do so, insert a comma after the
square bracket following the <tt> type : 'int' </tt> statement as well 
as the following code:
</p>
<pre>
    Checkbox : [
        title : 'Toggle'	// checkbox label
    ]   
</pre>

<p>If you trigger the panel by pressing OK, you will notice that the
<tt>Checkbox</tt> value is not returned in the panel values. Add
the following line above the <tt>Checkbox title</tt> specification:
</p>
<pre>
    name : 'checkbox',		// checkbox identifier
</pre>

<p>The panel values now contain an item checkbox: 1
means that the checkbox is on, and 0 means that the checkbox is off.
Note that it is only possible to obtain values for
widgets that have been given names.
</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Field names must be unique to retrieve
their values.  No error message is given for non unique names;
however, only one of the widgets will be returned with a value.
</p>

<h2><a name="TriggeringOnAWidget"></a>Triggering on a Widget</h2>

<p>It is often necessary to obtain the user's input as soon
as they change a value in a widget instead of waiting until they press the
OK button.  For instance, one may wish to obtain the results of the text
input when the user presses <tt>Return</tt> in the text field.
</p>
<p>The <tt>onTrigger</tt> attribute allows you to specify which action
will take place when a widget in the panel is acted upon.
In most cases, the widget <tt>onTrigger</tt> attribute defaults
to <tt>'ignore'</tt>. To respond to user interaction, you 
must explicitly set the attribute to <tt>'return'</tt>.
</p>
<p>A slight modification to the code of <tt>GetValues</tt> will cause the
panel to trigger on the age field. In the panel descriptor of
<tt>GetValues</tt> created in the previous step, add the 
<tt>onTrigger</tt> line to the age specification as follows:
</p>
<pre>
    Text : [
        name  : 'age',          // text field identifier
        title : 'Age:',   	// text field label
        type  : 'int',		// expected data type
        onTrigger : 'return'    // causes field to return on trigger
    ],
</pre>

<p> Note that there is no relation between the <tt>onTrigger</tt>
attribute which is set to 'return' and pressing the <tt>Return</tt> key. 
</p>

<p>Save and load the file. At the CLI, run <tt>GetValues []</tt>. Type
some characters in the age text field and press <tt>Return</tt>.
The text field is now triggered, if the focus is in the field. 
The output of the WindowPrompt can be seen in the SVL Commands window.
</p>
<p>In some instances, it makes sense to have the widget always
respond if the user triggers it.  The <tt>button</tt> is one such
widget as it would otherwise do nothing when
pressed. The <tt>button</tt> widget defines the default action of the
<tt>onTrigger</tt> attribute to <tt>'return'</tt>.  For information on
widget default values, refer to the widget function reference pages.
</p>
<h2><a name="AddingBubbleHelp"></a>Adding Bubble Help</h2>

<p>In this section, you will learn how to add on-line help to the
application in the form of bubble help. Bubble help -- a yellow "bubble"
containing a short descriptive text -- may be added to any widget in a
panel by simply inserting a line within the widget description, with the
bubbleHelp attribute containing the token to be displayed.
</p>

<p>To add bubble help to the text field, insert the following line after
the <tt> title : 'Name'</tt> statement of the name field in
<tt>GetValues</tt> so it read:
</p>
<pre>
    Text : [
        name  : 'name',		// default data type is 'char'
        title : 'Name:',	// Don't forget to add the coma!
	bubbleHelp : 'Please enter your name.'
    ],
</pre>

<p>Save and load the file before invoking the command at the CLI.
When the panel appears, hold the mouse cursor motionless over the
Name text field for about a second. Bubble help remains on screen until 
you move the cursor, press a key or mouse button.
</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> If bubble help does not appear, it may be that you must press
<tt>Ctrl</tt> to activate its display or that your
application has bubble help turned off. In the MOE Window, 
open the <span class="nobr"><b>Window | Options</b></span> panel to see the 
bubble help setting.
</p>

<p>If you add bubble help to a widget that contains several other widgets
(e.g. command buttons, button bars),  you must insert the same number 
of bubble help tokens as there are child widgets. For example, three
bubble help tokens must be added to a radio box containing three buttons.
Otherwise, this might induce unpredictable results such as the widget not
appearing or appearing in a strange form.
</p>

<pre>
    Radio: [
	name: 'radio',
	text: ['a','b','c'],
	bubbleHelp: [
	    'help on button a',
	    'help on button b',
	    'help on button c'
	]
    ]
</pre>


<h2><a name="KeepingThePanelUp"></a>Keeping the Panel Up</h2>


<p>To this point, you have created simple panels that automatically close
once input is received from the user.  Such panels are useful for prompting
the user for input to a function. However, it is also possible to create panels
that remain open to continue processing user input.
</p>
<p>The following example demonstrates how to create a panel that responds
to triggers yet remains open until the Close button is pressed.  To do
this, follow these steps:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Create the window using <tt>WindowCreate</tt></li>
<li>Display the window using <tt>WindowShow</tt></li>
<li>Insert an endless loop around <tt>WindowWait</tt> (function that
waits for triggers)</li>
</ul>

<p>Enter the following code:
</p>
<pre>
    global function WaitForClose []
        local winkey = WindowCreate [	// Create the window
            name     : 'shell',
            text     : 'Close',       	// command buttons
            onTrigger: 'exit',		// exit on trigger
            title    : 'Greetings',

            Label : [ text : 'Hello world!' ],
            Text : [
                name : 'text',                  // field identifier
                title : 'What is your name?',   // field label
                onTrigger: 'return',
                type : 'char'                   // expected data type
            ]
        ];

        WindowShow winkey;         // Display the window

            // Enter infinite loop

        loop
            local [vals,trigger] = WindowWait winkey;

                // after the panel is "triggered", the values of
                // its "named" components are returned

            if trigger == 'text' then   // vals contains panel values
                write ['  Hello {}.\n', vals.text];
            endif
        endloop
    endfunction
</pre>

<p>Type <tt>WaitForClose []</tt> in the SVL Commands window to display
the panel. Enter your name and press <tt>Return</tt>. A greeting is
printed to the SVL Commands window, and your panel remains on screen.  
To close the panel,you must press the Close button.
</p>
<a name="UsingManagerWidgets"></a><h2>Using Manager Widgets</h2>


<p>Every panel includes a <i>shell</i> manager widget. 
The toolkit includes several other manager widgets:
Vbox, Hbox, Mbox, and Pager. A shell acts like 
a Vbox, a box which vertically aligns its children. 
If no manager widgets are used, the entire panel consists of
a list of vertically aligned widgets.
Nesting many managers allows you to layout widgets in elaborate
fashions.
</p>
<p>In this example you will create a simple panel with four
labels.  However, instead of using only the default Vbox provided by the
shell, you will nest manager widgets to lay out the labels in a complex
pattern. You will also use the core attribute <tt>shadow</tt> to draw the
outline of each manager.  
</p>
<pre>
    global function LayoutExample []
        local wkey = WindowCreate [
            name  : 'shell',
            title : 'Layout Example',	// Window title
            text  : 'Close',		// Shell button text
            onTrigger : 'exit',		// Shell button trigger

            Hbox : [
            	shadow : 'etched-in',	
		Label : [text : 'Manager 1']
            ],
            Hbox : [
                Vbox : [
                    shadow : 'etched-in',
		    Label : [text : 'Manager 2']
                ],
                Vbox : [
                    Hbox : [
                        shadow : 'etched-in',
			Label : [text : 'Manager 3']
                    ],
                    Hbox : [
                        shadow : 'etched-in',
			Label : [text : 'Manager 4']
                    ]
                ]
            ]
        ];

        WindowShow wkey;		// Show panel

        loop			
            local [vals,trigger] = WindowWait wkey;
        endloop 

    endfunction
</pre>


<h2><a name="CreatingAList"></a>Creating a List</h2>

<p>
There are several ways of displaying a series of choices to the user. 
If the number of choices is limited and the user can only 
select one item at a time, you might choose an option menu or a series of 
radio boxes.Toggle buttons allow the user to select more than one
item at a time but are harder to implement in larger numbers.
</p>

<p>
In general, the <tt>List</tt> widget is used to display a series of items 
from which the user may select one or multiple items (depending on the
<tt>multiSelect</tt> attribute). This widget allows you to set the text for 
all items in a single statement and establish a default action with
clicking or double-clicking on items.
</p>

<p> Suppose you want to show the list of files in the current
directory. You can retrieve and store the names of the files
in the variable <tt>fnames</tt> with the following command:
</p>
<pre>
    local fnames = flist [];
</pre>

<p>The following code displays the file list in a <tt>List</tt> widget:</p>

<pre>
    global function ListExample []

	local fnames = flist [];	// Get file list

	local wkey = WindowCreate [	// create window
	    name: 'shell',		
	    text: 'Close',		// shell button text
	    onTrigger: 'exit',		// shell button trigger
	    title: 'List Example',	// shell title
	    Listbox: [
		name : 'listbox',	// list identifier
		title : 'Files:',	// list label
		onTrigger: 'return',	// list trigger
		text : fnames		// list content

	    ] 
	];   

	WindowShow wkey;		// show window

	    // endless loop (wait for trigger)

	loop
	    local [vals, trigger] = WindowWait wkey;

		// If the listbox is triggered, output the selected
		// items to SVL Command Window

	    if trigger == 'listbox' then
		write ['Selected Item: ']; print vals.listbox;
	    endif
	endloop
    endfunction   
</pre>

<p>Note that <tt>fnames</tt>
is not surrounded by single quotes
because it is a variable name. However, the content of <tt>fnames</tt>
is a vector of tokens.
</p>
<p>Load the file and display the panel by entering <tt>ListExample []</tt> 
at the CLI. You should see a list of the files in the current directory.
</p>
<p>Select one of the items from the list.  The SVL Commands window
contains a line of the form <tt>Selected Item: [ 'file name', number of click]
</tt>. You can verify this by double-clicking on an item.
</p>
<p>Now add the following line to the <tt>Listbox</tt> specification after
the <tt>title : 'Files:',</tt> line:
</p>
<pre>
    multiSelect : 1,
</pre>

<p>Display the panel and select several items in the list.
In the SVL Commands window, the listbox returns
the indices of all selected items. 
</p>

<h2><a name="CreatingAPager"></a>Creating a Pager</h2>

<p>The <i>pager</i> is a manager widget that  
groups and displays related child widgets on one page,  
while hiding other pages. The premise of the pager is to allow the user to
select which page to view or to create a wizard to assist the user in the
completion of a task.
</p>
<p>In the following example you will create a pager that contains three pages. 
The pager displays the page based on the page attribute, which is an integer.
The pager's children are numbered 1...n in order of creation. A radio
button will be used to trigger the change of page. A radio button
is a set of buttons of which exactly one is selected at any given
time. The radio buttons data type is set to 'int' so that the radio's 
return value can be used as the page attribute value.
</p>

<pre>
    global function PageExample []
	local wkey = WindowCreate [		// Create the window
	    name  : 	'shell',
	    title : 	'Paged Panel',
	    text  : 	'Close',		// shell button text
	    onTrigger : 'exit',			// shell button trigger

	    Radio: [
		name: 'page_option',		// radio identifier
		text: ['Page 1', 'Page 2', 'Page 3'],
		extendH : 1,			// extend horizontally
		onTrigger: 'return',		// radio trigger
		type: 'int'			// return 1,2,3
	    ],

	    Pager : [
		name: 'pager',			// pager identifier
		page: 1,			// start on page 1		
		shadow: 'etched-in',		// draw border

		    // First page

		Vbox : [
		    Text : [ name : 'text1', title: 'First Name:'],
		    Text : [ name : 'text2', title: 'Last Name:']
		],

		    // Second page

		Vbox : [
		    Text : [ name : 'text3', title: 'Address:'],
		    Text : [ name : 'text4', title: 'Postal Code:']
		],
	
		    // Third page

		Vbox : [
		    Text : [ name : 'text5', title: 'Reference 1:'],
		    Text : [ name : 'text6', title: 'Reference 2:']
		]
	    ]
	];

	WindowShow wkey;			// Show the window

	    // endless loop (wait for trigger)

	loop
	    local [vals,trigger] = WindowWait wkey;
	    
	    if trigger === 'page_option' then        // change pages
		WindowSetAttr [wkey, 
		    [pager : [page:vals.page_option]]
		];
	    endif

	endloop
    endfunction
</pre>


<h2><a name="CreatingAFileSelectionBox"></a>Creating a File Selection Box</h2>

<p>You will now learn how to use a file selection box (FSB).  For
convenience, <tt>WindowPrompt</tt> is used in the example to display 
the panel:
</p>
<pre>
    const FSB_PANEL = [
	title : 'Open File',
	FSB : [
	    name : 'fsb',	// FSB identifier
	    mode : 'open'	// FSB validation mode
	] 
    ];

    global function fsb_example [] = WindowPrompt [ FSB_PANEL, [] ];
</pre>

<p>Save and load. In the panel, enter the name of a non-existent file in the
text field.  You will be warned that such a file does not
exist. This is because the mode attribute as been set to open. In this mode,
the file selection box widget automatically verifies valid filenames 
when the widget is triggered.
</p>
<p>Double-click on one of the items in the Files listbox.  Observe
that the FSB is set to trigger on a double-click.  The name
of the selected file is printed out in the SVL Commands window as the
return value of the <tt>WindowPrompt</tt> function call.
</p>
<p>Suppose you are interested in files of a given extension and 
want the <tt>FSB</tt> to list only those files.  We set the default value
of the FSB:
</p>
<pre>
    global function fsb_example [] =
	WindowPrompt [ FSB_PANEL, [fsb:'*.svl'] ] 
    ;
</pre>

<p>The Path text field includes a popup menu that 
shows the list of recent directories. You can
add your own entries to it. In the <tt>FSB</tt>
descriptor, add the following line after the <tt>name</tt> specification:
</p>
<pre>
    recentDirs : ['$HOME','$MOE/sample/mol'],
</pre>

<p>In the panel, click the right mouse button (press <tt>Alt</tt>
if you are using a two-button mouse) in the Path text field
to see the added directories.

<h2><a name="CreatingAPrompter"></a>Creating a Prompter</h2>

<p>This section describes how to create a special kind of window
for interacting with one of the application's primary windows.
This window, called a Prompter, preempts the command line area
and resides within the associated application window.
</p>
<p>In this example, you will add a Prompter to the 
<a href="../moe/gui/se.html">Sequence Editor</a>:
</p>
<pre>
    global function prompter_example []
	local wkey = WindowCreate [
	    title : 'Prompter',
	    location : 'SequenceEditor',  // designates parent window
	    Text : [
		name : 'text',
		title : 'Text',
		onTrigger:'return'
	    ],
	    Slider: [
		name : 'slider',
		title : 'Slider',
		range : [0,10,1]
	    ],
	    Button: [ 
		name : 'button',
		text : 'OK'
	    ]
	];

        WindowShow 'Sequence Editor';
	print first WindowWait wkey;
    endfunction
</pre>

<p>The prompter is displayed in the command line of the
Sequence Editor.  The designated location  must be valid, otherwise
a stand-alone window will be displayed. For instance, if you gave 
an unknown location such as:
</p>
<pre>
    location: 'xxx',
</pre>

<p>The valid locations for a prompter are listed in
<tt><a href="../svl/svlgui/fcnref/wt_shell.html">Prompter</a></tt>.
</p>
<p>Here are a few more examples of <tt>Prompter</tt> window descriptors.
</p>
<pre>
    local panel = [
        name : 'atomprompt',
        mode : 'pickAtom',
        location : 'MOE',
        title : 'Pick an atom...'
    ];

    local panel = [
        name : 'resprompt',
        mode : 'pickResidue',
        location : 'SequenceEditor',
        title : 'Pick a residue...'
    ];

    local panel = [
        name : 'dbprompt',
        mode : 'pickCell',
        location : ['DatabaseViewer', dbkey],
        title : 'Pick a cell...'
    ];

    local panel = [
        name : 'tedprompt',
        location : ['SVLTextEditor', ted_Default[]],
        title : 'Pick a cell...'
    ];

</pre>

<p>The return value of a <tt>Prompter</tt> can be obtained, as with any
other window object, using <tt>WindowWait</tt>. For example:
</p>
<pre>
    local wkey = WindowCreate [
        name : 'atomprompt',
        mode : 'pickAtom',
        location : 'MOE',
        title : 'Pick an atom...'
    ];

    local values = first WindowWait wkey;
    local atom = values.atomprompt;
</pre>
