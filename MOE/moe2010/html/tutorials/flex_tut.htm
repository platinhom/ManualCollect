<h2>Flexible Alignment Tutorial</h2>
<hr noshade="noshade" />

<p>
MOE's Flexible Alignment application flexibly aligns small molecules by
maximizing steric and feature overlap while minimizing internal ligand strain.
The features used in Flexible Alignment derive from the following qualitative 
notions of a good alignment:

<ol class="lalpha">

<li>The strain energy of each molecule is small.</li>
<li>Molecules have a similar shape.</li>
<li>Molecules have similar LogP(octanol/water) values.</li>
<li>Molecules have comparable molar refractivities.</li>
<li>Aromatic atoms overlap.</li>
<li>Hydrogen bond donors and acceptors overlap.</li>
<li>Acidic groups and basic groups overlap.</li>
<li>Atoms of similar partial charge overlap.</li>
<li>Hydrophobic areas overlap.</li>

</ol>

<p>Some or all of these features can be chosen for defining the similarity
function.  To learn more about the related methodology behind
Flexible Alignment, see <a href="../apps/flex.htm">Flexible Alignment</a>.

<p>This tutorial is divided into three exercises:  

<ol>
<p><li>In the <a href="#Exercise1">first exercise</a>,
Flexible Alignment is run on
two molecules, Physostigmine and Neostigmine.

<p><li>In the <a href="#Exercise2">second exercise</a>,
Flexible Alignment is used to obtain the optimal alignment of a
pair of CDK ligands obtained from a database.

<p><li>In the <a href="#Exercise3">third exercise</a>,
Flexible Alignment is used to determine the binding mode of 
a new class of CDK2 inhibitors by flexibly aligning a 
query ligand to a fixed template of ligand conformations obtained from 
X-ray structures.

<a name="Exercise1"></a><H3>Exercise 1</H3>

<p>
Physostigmine, an alkaloid extracted from the Calabar bean,
is a "dark brown highly poisonous seed of a tropical African woody
vine that is used as an ordeal poison in
native witchcraft trials" (Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, Tenth
Edition).  The second molecule, Neostigmine (used in the treatment of
glaucoma), binds to acetylcholinesterase in such a manner that its
trimethylammonium group is at the anionic site of the enzyme.

</p><center><img src="flex_tut/2Dphysos.png" alt="Two Molecules in browser" /></center>

<ol>

<p><li>Open the files that contain the Physostigmine and Neostigmine
molecules:

<blockquote><span class="menu">MOE | File | Open</span></blockquote>

<p>
In the Open panel, select <tt>$MOE/sample/mol/neost.moe</tt>.
Hold down the <tt>&lt;Ctrl&gt;</tt> key and select
<tt>$MOE/sample/mol/physos.moe</tt>.  Press <b>OK</b>.
(In the confirmation panel, press <b>Yes</b>.)
</p>

<p>
To center the molecules in the window, use
</p>

<blockquote><span class="menu">MOE | Render | Center</span></blockquote>

<p>
<center><img src="flex_tut/2mols.png" alt = "Two Molecules in MOE" /></center>
</p>

<p><li>If you wish to move one or both molecules to get a better view of
their structural features:

<ol type="a">

<p><li>In the MOE rendering area, click on any atom of one of the molecular
structures.

<p><li>To select the entire molecule, choose:

<p><span class="menu">MOE | Selection | Extend | Molecule</span></p>

<p><li>
<div class="floatright">
<img src="moetour/trackball1.png" alt="Trackball">
</div>
To move (translate) the selected molecule, press <tt>Alt-Shift</tt> and drag
the middle mouse button. To rotate, press <tt>Alt</tt> as you do the drag.
Alternatively, hold the <tt>Alt</tt> key and
drag left over the trackball.  This results in rotation.  For translation
(panning) using the trackball, first toggle the trackball mode
by pressing the small button labeled &quot;R&quot;.  The label will change
to &quot;T&quot; as a reminder that the trackball is currently in
&quot;translate&quot; mode.  Now, holding the <tt>Alt</tt> key and dragging left over
the trackball results in translational motion of the selected atoms.
</p>

<p><li>Deselect the atoms by clicking in the MOE rendering area away from
the structures.

<p><li>To zoom in closer to the two molecules, press <tt>Ctrl</tt> and
drag the middle mouse button or use the mouse wheel.  Alternatively,
use the trackball dial.

</ol>

<p><li>Assign charges on the atoms by choosing a forcefield
and calculating charges accordingly:

<ol type="a">
<p>The current forcefield setting is shown on the left of the 
<b>MOE Footer</b>: </p>
<p class="cntr"><img src="moetour/ffsetting.png" alt="Forcefield setting" /></p>

<p>To change the forcefield, click the button showing the forcefield name, or 
use <span class="menu">MOE | Window | Potential Setup</span>
</p>

<p><li>If the forcefield type is not <b>MMFF94x</b> choose <b>MMFF94x</b> as the 
forcefield using the <b>Load...</b> pulldown menu and close the Potential Setup 
panel.
</li><p>
</p><center><img src="flex_tut/potsetup.png" alt="Potential Setup Panel" /></center>

<p><li>To calculate the partial charges on the atoms, you can do any
of the following:

<ul>
<li>
Press <b>Fix Charges</b> before clicking <b>OK</b> or <b>Close</b> in the 
Potential Setup panel, above; OR
</li>
<li>
<span class="menu">MOE | Compute | Partial Charges</span>.
Press <b>OK</b> in the Partial Charges panel; OR
</li>
<li>
Ensure the <b>Calculate Forcefield Partial Charges</b> Option checkbox
is set in the Flexible Alignment Panel, below.
</li>
</ul>

</ol>

<p><li>You are now ready to start the flexible alignment calculation.
Open the Flexible Alignment panel:

<p><span class="menu">MOE | Compute | Simulations | Flexible Alignment</span>

</p><center><img src="flex_tut/flex.png" alt="Flexible Alignment Panel" /></center>

<ol type="a">
<p><li>The default <b>Output Database</b> name is <tt>flexalgn.mdb</tt>.
Change this to <tt>physos.mdb</tt>.  

<p><li>The only parameter to modify is the <b>Iteration Limit</b>.
Decrease this to 20 (instead of the default value of 200).  Use
the default values for the remaining options.

<p><li>Press <b>OK </b> to start the calculation.  This operation
can take a few minutes (about 5 minutes on a 1GHz Pentium).
</ol>

<p>As the calculation proceeds, the aligned structures, along with the
strain energy <b>U</b>, the total mutual similarity score <b>F</b>
(lower means more similar),
and the value of the objective function <b>S</b> of
each alignment, are written to the <tt>physos.mdb</tt> database. 

<p><li>The next stage is to study the alignment. First, copy the aligned 
structures to the MOE Window.

<blockquote>
Double-click on the <b>molecule</b> field cell of entry 1.
Press <b>Yes</b> when prompted to clear the system.
</blockquote>

<p>You may close the <b>DBV</b> at this point as it is no longer needed.


<p><li>Change the rendering of the molecular system to stick mode:

<b>MOE | Render | Atoms | Stick</b>

<p>
<center><img src="flex_tut/RenderStick.png" alt="Render Atoms Panel" /></center>
</p>


<p><li>Examine the structures in the MOE Window, as shown here:

<p>
<center><img src="flex_tut/aligned.png" alt="Aligned Molecules" /></center>
</p>

<p>
The amide groups of Physostigmine and Neostigmine align well, as do
the two phenyl moieties.  The alignment suggests that the
features common to these two molecules are the amide side chain and
the phenyl ring.
</p>

</ol>



<a name="Exercise2"></a><h3>Exercise 2:</h3>

<p>
Cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) is a protein target with great
pharmacological significance. Its inhibition can be harnessed to
treat several diseases including cancer. In this exercise, we
try to superpose two CDK inhibitors that bear little if any
common molecular substructure.

<p>
The following pictures show the structures of these inhibitors:

<p>
<div align="center">
<img src="flex_tut/lig1.png" alt= "ligand1"/>
<img src="flex_tut/lig2.png" alt= "ligand2"/>
</div>
</p>

<a name="Exercise2A"></a>
<h3>Display the Alignment of CDK Ligands in Crystal Structures</h3>

<p>
To illustrate the alignment of the ligands in the binding pocket,
we shall first use the 
<a href="../proteins/align.htm">protein alignment tool</a> 
to align the PDB entries.
Since this step is purely for showing the correct alignment,
you could also skip it and proceed directly to
<a href="#Exercise2B">flexible alignment of the CDK Ligands</a>
from a database.
</p>
<ol type="a">

<p><li>Close the system: <span class="menu">MOE | RHS | Close</span></p>
<p><li>Load the files from the Protein Data Bank: 

<p><span class="menu">MOE | File | PSILO/RCSB Download</span></p>

<b>Note:</b> Downloading files from the internet requires that
Java be configured to run with MOE. Please read instructions on 
<a href="../install/install.htm#JDBC">installing&nbsp;java</a> 
if there is any trouble in using the RCSB Browse application.


<p>
</p><center><img src="../proteins/pdb_mdb/PSILO_browse.png"></center>

<ol type="i">
<p><li>Change the "<b>Site:</b>" to <b>RCSB PDB</b>.
<p><li>In the "<b>Extra Codes:</b>" text box, type <tt>1dm2,1e9h</tt>.
<p><li>Toggle on the <b>Copy Proteins to MOE</b> check box.
<p><li>Press <b>Download...</b>.
<p><li>In the <b>RCSB Download</b> panel, press <b>Start</b> to initiate the
download.
<p><li>After the download is finished, delete the PDB files 
that were created in the directory that was specified in the "<b>Directory:</b>"
textbox in the <b>PSILO/RCSB Browse</b> panel.
<p><li>Press <b>Close</b> to close the <b>RCSB Download</b> panel and press
<b>Cancel</b> to close the <b>PSILO/RCSB Browse</b> panel.

</ol>

<p><li>For <tt>1E9H</tt>, keep only the chains named <tt>1E9H.A</tt>. 
Also delete the water chains.</p></li>
<ol type="i">
<p><li>Open the Sequence Editor (SE): <b>MOE | SEQ</b>.
<p><li>Display the names of the chains: <b>SE | Display | Compound Name</b>
<p><li>Select the non-water chains of <tt>1DM2</tt> and non-water
chains with the name <tt>1E9H.A</tt>. 
(To select multiple chains use <tt>Ctrl</tt> mouse click.) Then invert the
chain selection:
<p><span class="menu">SE | Selection | Invert Chains</span></p>

<p>
</p><center><img src="flex_tut/SeqEdtr.png" alt = "Sequence Editor"/></center>

<p><li> Now we can delete the unwanted chains:
<p><span class="menu">SE | Edit | Delete Selected Chains</span></p>
</ol>

<p><li>Then we perform a multiple sequence alignment: 
<p><span class="menu">SE | Homology | Align</span></p> 
Press <b>OK</b> on the <b>Protein Align</b> panel.

<p><li>Display only the ligands and pocket:
<ol type="i">
<p><li>In the Sequence Editor, select the residue <tt>INR</tt>.  

<p> 
Then select the ligand atoms in the MOE Window:
<span class="menu">SE | Selection | Atoms | Of Selected Residues</span></p>  

<p>Now select residues of the protein which are near to the ligand:
<span class="menu">MOE | RHS | Extend | Near Residues</span>
(or use the <span class="menu">MOE | Selection | Extend | 
Near Residues</span>)</p> 

<p>Finally hide all other atoms:
<span class="menu">MOE | Popup | Hide | Unselected</span></p> 

<p><li>Click on an empty space in MOE to clear the atom selection, and then
press 
<p><span class="menu">MOE | Render | Center</span></p>
to zoom into the ligands and pocket.

<p><li>Color the carbon atoms of the pocket by chain: right click on the chain 
index for the peptide chains (chains 1 and 3). Then use

<p><span class="menu">SE | Selected Chains Popup | Atoms | Chain</span></p> 
</li></p>

<center><img src="flex_tut/RenderCh.png" alt = "Render Color Chain" /></center>

<p><li>Render the ligands by stick mode: right click on the chain index for
the ligand chains (chains 2 and 4). Then use 

<p><span class="menu">SE |  Selected Chains | Atoms | Stick</span></p> 
</li></p>
<center><img src="flex_tut/RenderStick.png" alt="Render Atoms Panel" /></center>

<p>
The aligned ligands in the binding pocket appear as shown in the image below.
</p>
<center><img src="flex_tut/align.png" alt = "aligned cdk ligands"/></center>

<p>Note that the lactam group (peptide group in a ring) of each of the two 
ligands form a pair of hydrogen bonds with the protein backbone of the hinge 
region of the kinase. Note also that the sulfonate group of <tt>1E9H</tt> 
occupies roughly the same space as the oxo-pyrazole ring of <tt>1DM2</tt>.
</p>
</ol></ol>

<a name="Exercise2B"></a>
<h3>Flexible Alignment of CDK Ligands</h3>
<p>
Having examined the aligned ligands in their crystal environment, we now
proceed to align the molecules using Flexible Alignment.

<ol>
<p><li>Clear the molecular data in MOE: 
<p><span class="menu">MOE | File | Close</span></p>

<p><li>Open the file containing the shuffled ligands:

<p><span class="menu">MOE | File | Open | </span><tt>$MOE/sample/mol/flexcdk.mdb</tt></p>

<p><li>Select both rows of the mdb: 
<p><span class="menu">DBV | Edit | Select All | Entries</span></p>
Right click on any cell of the <b>mol</b> column and choose
<b>Send Selected to MOE</b> to load the molecules into MOE.

<p><b>Note:</b> To run Flexible Alignment successfully, the molecules must
have all their hydrogens and must have partial charges assigned.  In this
case,
hydrogens have already been added to the randomized ligands,
and partial charges have already been calculated.
</p>

<p><li>Open the Flexible Alignment panel:
<p><span class="menu">MOE | Compute | Simulations | Flexible Alignment</span></p>
Change the <b>Output Database</b> name
if desired. Use the default settings for the other parameters.
Press <b>OK</b> to run the calculation. The calculation typically takes 
a few minutes (around 5 minutes on a 2 GHz Apple G5).

<p>As the calculation proceeds, the aligned molecules are written to the
database. The column <b>U</b>
contains the average internal energy of the ligands. The column <b>F</b>
contains the similarity score (the lower the better) of the alignment.
The column <b>S</b> is the sum of <b>U</b> and <b>F</b>.

<p><li>Even before the run terminates, one can inspect the result
via the database viewer. Keep in mind that lower <b>S</b> values
correspond to better alignments.

<ol type="a">
<p><li>Left click on a cell in the <b>mol</b> column and drag the mouse
towards lower right to enlarge the cell.
<p><li>Use the middle mouse button to rotate the molecules in the cell.
</ol>

<p>
</p><center>
<img src="flex_tut/OutMDB.png" alt = "Flex Align Output MDB" />
</center>

<p><li>After the calculation is finished, the best solution (the alignment
with the lowest S score) will be loaded into the MOE Window.

<p><li>A typical result is shown in the image below: the lactam groups 
(peptide group in a ring), which are involved in the hydrogen bonds to
the protein backbone of the kinase hinge region, are aligned.
The sulfonate group roughly overlaps with the oxo-pyrazole ring.
Although the orientation of the oxo-pyrazole ring may be rotated with
respect to the crystal orientation, it is not unreasonable given that
Flexible Alignment does not have any information about the receptor. Note: To 
turn off the hydrogen bond display go to 
<span class="menu">MOE Footer | 
<a href="../moe/gui/mainwin.htm#Contacts">Contacts</a></span>.
Then in the popup panel go to the interaction matrix for the hydrogen bonds and 
click on the <b>Lig/Lig</b> button to turn off the interactions that are displayed.
</p><center><img src="flex_tut/result.png" alt = "Aligned Molecules" /></center>

</ol>


<a name="Exercise3"></a><h3>Exercise 3:</h3>

<p>
One approach to using the Flexible Alignment application is to flexibly align known 
inhibitors to "fixed" ligand conformations obtained from crystal structures. In this 
way one can predict the binding mode of a new ligand class based on crystal 
structures of ligands from different classes. In this example, the CDK2 inhibitor LS4 
shown below will be flexibly aligned to a fixed template of two inhibitors which we
will create by aligning their X-ray complexes. 


<a name="Exercise3A"></a>
<h3>Building the LS4 Ligand</h3>

<ol type="i">
<p><li>Use the <b>Molecule Builder</b> to build the LS4 ligand shown below:
</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="flex_tut/LS4.png" alt= "LS4 Ligand"/>
</div>
<center><b>LS4</b></center>
<p>
<p><li>Change the rendering of the molecular system to stick mode:

<b>MOE | Render | Atoms | Stick</b>

<p>
<center><img src="flex_tut/RenderStick.png" alt="Render Atoms Panel" /></center>
</p>

<p><li>When you have built the ligand, save it to a MOE file called
<tt>LS4.moe</tt>.
</p>
<p><li>Close the system: <span class="menu">MOE | RHS | Close</span></p>
</ol>

<a name="Exercise3B"></a>
<h3>Aligning the CDK2/Ligand Complexes</h3>

<p>
To obtain a fixed template of bound ligands for flexibly aligning LS4, 
we will use the <a href="../proteins/align.htm">protein alignment tool</a> 
to align the PDB entries 1GIH and 1G5S.
Using <span class="menu">File | Open</span>, select the files
<tt>$MOE/sample/mol/1gih.pdb</tt> and 
<tt>$MOE/sample/mol/1g5s.pdb</tt>.  Press <b>OK</b>.
Press <b>Yes</b> in the confirmation panel and use the default settings in the 
<b>Load PDB File</b> panel to load the two CDK2 complexes into MOE.
</p>

<ol type="i">
<p><li>Open the Sequence Editor (SE): <b>MOE | SEQ</b>.
<p><li>Perform a multiple sequence alignment: 
<p><span class="menu">SE | Homology | Align</span></p> 
Press <b>OK</b> in the <b>Protein Align</b> panel. The proteins
will align in the MOE window.
<p><li>In the Sequence Editor, select protein and water chains
(To select multiple chains use <tt>Ctrl</tt> mouse click.) Now we can delete the 
unwanted chains.
<p><span class="menu">SE | Edit | Delete Selected Chains</span></p>
<p><li>Change the rendering of the molecular system to stick mode:

<b>MOE | Render | Atoms | Stick</b>

<p>
<center><img src="flex_tut/RenderStick.png" alt="Render Atoms Panel" /></center>
</p>
<p><li>Press <span class="menu">MOE | Render | Center</span>
to center the view. There should 
be two aligned CDK2 ligands in the MOE Window as shown below:
<p>

<center><img src="flex_tut/CDK2_align1.png" alt = "CDK2_algn1" /></center>

<p><li>Add hydrogens to the ligands:
<p><span class="menu">MOE | Edit | Hydrogens | Add Hydrogens...</span></p> 
<p><li>To fix the aligned ligands in place, we must first select all the atoms:
<p><span class="menu">MOE | Selection | Invert</span></p> 
<p><li>With all the ligand atoms selected, fix the aligned ligands with:
<p><span class="menu">MOE | Edit | Potential | Fix </span></p>
<p> The aligned ligands are now fixed and will not move during the 
Flexible Alignment run.</p>
 
<p><li>Color the ligand atoms by chain
<p><span class="menu">MOE | Render | Atoms | Color: Chain</span></p> 
</li></p>
<center><img src="flex_tut/RenderCh.png" alt = "Render Color Chain" /></center>
<p><li>Finally, hide the hydrogens to get a better view of the aligned ligands
<p><span class="menu">MOE | Render | Hide | Hydrogens</span></p> 
</li></p>
<p><li>Left-click in empty space in the MOE window to deselect all atoms. The 
aligned CDK2 ligands should appear as shown.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<center><img src="flex_tut/CDK2_align2.png" alt = "CDK2_algn2" /></center>


<a name="Exercise3C"></a>
<h3>Flexible Alignment of LS4 to Fixed CDK2 Ligands</h3>

<p>
We will now flexibly align the LS4 ligand to the fixed template of CDK2 ligands 
</p>
</p>

<ol type="i">
<p><li>Load the previously prepared <tt>LS4.moe</tt> file into 
MOE using:  <b>MOE | File | Open</b>.
<p><li>Open the Flexible Alignment panel:
<p><span class="menu">MOE | Compute | Simulations | Flexible Alignment</span></p>
Change the <b>Output Database</b> name
if desired. Use the default settings for the other parameters.
Press <b>OK</b> to run the calculation. The calculation typically takes 15-30
minutes to complete.

<p><li>As the calculation proceeds, the aligned molecules are written to the
database. Note that the LS4 ligand is flexibly aligned to the 
fixed template of the 1GIH and 1G5S ligands. The column <b>U</b>
contains the average internal energy of the ligands. Since the template ligands
are fixed, any variations in <b>U</b> are due to 
strain energy changes in the LS4 ligand. The column <b>F</b>
contains the similarity score of the alignment.
The column <b>S</b> is the sum of <b>U</b> and <b>F</b>.
<p><li>After the calculation is finished, the solution with the lowest combined
score (<b>S</b>) will be will be loaded into MOE.
<p>
<p>

</p><center><img src="flex_tut/flex_result1.png" alt = "Flex_Result1" /></center>
</ol>

<a name="Exercise3D"></a>
<h3>Analyzing LS4 Flexible Alignment Results</h3>

<p>
At the end of the Flexible Alignment run, the output database is sorted
by <b>S</b> in ascending order, i.e. the conformation with the lowest
<b>S</b> will be at the top of the database.
In many cases, alignments with low <b>S</b> values will be among 
the best alignments. However, care must be taken when examining the flexible alignment
results; since the application works by balancing intramolecular strain 
forces with intermolecular pharmacophoric forces, pharmacophoric forces can 
sometimes overpower the internal strain forces in a system, yielding alignments with 
large similarity scores (large negative <b>F</b>) but which contain
unreasonably strained ligands (large <b>dU</b>). Thus, it is always advisable 
to inspect the Flexible Alignment results and discard alignments with 
unreasonable ligand geometries.
</p>
<p>
<p>
Since the two template ligands are fixed in this example, all of the reported 
strain energy differences (<b>dU</b>) arise from the LS4 molecule.
The best-scoring alignment contains a highly strained conformer of LS4, with 
an intramolecular H-bond and a slight out-of-place bend for the phenyl 
substituents. Although this alignment has a large negative <b>S</b>, 
the conformation of the LS4 ligand is unrealistic, and therefore it is probably 
<i>not</i> a good alignment. </p>
</p>

<p>
To examine the alignments with the least strain for LS4, sort the database by 
ascending <b>dU</b>. The results should contain a number of alignments with 
<b>dU</b>&lt;1 kcal/mol. To browse through the alignment results, perform the following:
</p>

</p>

<ol type="i">
<p><li>Close the system: <span class="menu">MOE | RHS | Close</span></p>
<p><li>Open the <b>Database Browser:</b>
<p><span class="menu">DBV | File | Browse...</span></p>
<p>
<p><li>Hide the hydrogens to get a better view of the aligned ligands
<p><span class="menu">MOE | Render | Hide | Hydrogens</span></p> 
</p>
<p><li>Change the rendering of the molecular system to stick mode:

<b>MOE | Render | Atoms | Stick</b>

<p><li>Color the ligand atoms by chain
<p><span class="menu">MOE | Render | Atoms | Color: Chain</span></p> 
<p>
<center><img src="flex_tut/RenderCh.png" alt = "Render Color Chain" /></center>

<p><li>The first alignment should be similar to what is shown below; the fixed 
template ligands in green and red, with the aligned LS4 in blue. 

<p>
<center><img src="flex_tut/flex_result_browse.png"
alt="flex_result_browse" /></center>
</p>

<p><li>Visually inspect all the low-strain energy solutions up to <b>dU</b>=1.</p>
<p><li>The low-strain solutions of LS4 should divide into two distinct 
alignment modes: MODE I and MODE II, shown in blue in each of the two images below.
The two modes are approximately 180 degree flips of one another.
<p>

<center><img src="flex_tut/flex_result_mode_1.png" alt = "mode I" /></center>
<p><center><b>MODE I</b></p></center>
<p>
<center><img src="flex_tut/flex_result_mode_2.png" alt = "mode II" /></center>
<p><center><b>MODE II</b></center>  
</p>

<p><li>Both the MODE I and MODE II orientations of LS4 appear to be reasonable alignments
with reasonable LS4 conformations. To choose the best alignment mode between these two 
possibilities, one could examine SAR data for LS4 analogs and choose the alignment mode that 
best explains the SAR. Since X-ray data for the CDK2 target is available,  
one could also examine how well the different LS4 alignments fit into the 
CDK2 binding pocket. 
</ol>
<p></p>

<a name="Exercise3E"></a>
<h3>LS4 Flexible Alignment Results in 1G5S pocket</h3>

<p>To examine the LS4 alignment modes in the CDK2 binding pocket, we will 
open up the 1G5S structure, draw a surface around the binding pocket
and browse through the Flexible Alignment results with the binding pocket surface

<ol type="i">
<p><li>In the Open panel, select <tt>$MOE/sample/mol/1g5s.pdb</tt>.
Press <b>OK</b>.
(In the confirmation panel, press Yes. Use the default settings in the 
<b>Load PDB File</b> panel to load the CDK2 complex.)</p>
<p><li>To draw a surface around the binding pocket, open the <b>Surfaces
and Maps</b>
panel</p>
<p><span class="menu">MOE | Compute | Surfaces and Maps...</span></p>
<p>
<p><li>Change the surface type to <b>Interaction (VDW)</b> and the rendering to 
<b>Line</b>. Change the <b>Color</b> to <b>Active LP</b>. Slide the <b>TB</b> slider 
(the right slider) to ~75 % to increase the back transparency of the surface  
(see settings below). Press <b>Create</b> to draw the surface.

<p><li>Hide the receptor with <b><span class="menu">MOE | Render | Hide | Receptor</span></b>
and hide the waters with <b><span class="menu">MOE | Render | Hide | Solvent.</span></b></p>

<p><li>Now use the <b>Database Browser</b> to browse through the alignments in the presence of the binding 
pocket. Note that the aligned ligands are colored by chain, so adding the protein, ligand and solvent 
chains of the 1G5S structure affects the aligned ligand chain colors. When browsing, the 1G5S ligand 
will now be purple, the 1GIH ligand will be brown and the LS4 will be green.
<p><li>As you browse through the low-<b>dU</b> Flexible Alignment results, note that the LS4 ligand 
penetrates through the binding pocket in many of the MODE II alignments. In contrast, most of the 
MODE I alignments have LS4 poses that do not penetrate the binding pocket.

<p><center><b>MODE II</b></p></center>
<p>
<p><li>Browse through the alignments and pick the MODE I alignment with the lowest <b>dU</b>
that does not penetrate the binding pocket.</p>
<p><li>Press <b>Keep</b> in the <b>Database Browser</b> to keep the alignment. Close the browser.
<p><li>We now have a low-strain alignment of LS4 that does not collide with the CDK2 binding pocket.
This is the best predicted alignment, based on this procedure.</p>

<h3>Comparison of LS4 alignment with X-ray pose</h3>

<p>
There exists an X-ray structure of LS4 bound to CDK2 (PDB code 1KE8). To compare the X-ray 
pose with our Flexible Alignment generated pose for LS4, we will open and align the 1KE8 structure
to our current alignment.</p>
<p>
<ol type="i">
<p><li>First, open the PDB file <tt>$MOE/sample/mol/1ke8.pdb</tt>.
Press <b>OK</b>. In the confirmation panel, press Yes. Use the default settings in the 
<b>Load PDB File</b> panel to load the 1KE8 complex.
<p><li>Open the Sequence Editor (SE): <b>MOE | SEQ</b>.
<p><li>Perform a multiple sequence alignment to align 1KE8 to 1G5S: 
<p><span class="menu">SE | Homology | Align</span></p> 
Press <b>OK</b> in the <b>Protein Align</b> panel. The proteins
will align in the MOE window.
<p><li>Hide the receptor with <b><span class="menu">MOE | Render | Hide | Receptor</span></b>
and hide the waters with <b><span class="menu">MOE | Render | Hide | Solvent.</span></b></p>
<p><li>The system should appear as below, with the alignment results in stick mode, and the 
1KE8 ligand in line mode.</p>
<p>
<center><img src="flex_tut/flex_result_1KE8.png" alt = "surf" /></center>
</p>
<p><li>To better visualize the X-ray LS4 conformation, select the entire ligand using
<tt>Ctrl</tt>-Left-Click on any atom of the ligand.
<p><li>Change the rendering of the 1KE8 ligand to stick mode:

<b>MOE | Render | Atoms | Stick</b>

<p>
<center><img src="flex_tut/RenderStick.png" alt="Render Atoms Panel" /></center>
</p>
<p><li>Hide the ligands from 1G5S and 1GIH by first selecting the entire ligands using
<tt>Shift-Ctrl</tt>-Left-Click on any of the ligand atoms, followed by 
<b><span class="menu">MOE | Render | Hide | Selected</span></b> to hide the atoms.
<p><li>The system should be similar to what is shown below. The LS4 pose produced from 
Flexible Alignment is in close agreement with the actual LS4 pose from X-ray
