<a name="Introduction"><h2>Introduction</h2></a>

<p>
The conformations available to a molecule dramatically affect
activity, reactivity or other properties.  Conformations responsible for
a particular property may not always correspond to the global minimum, and,
in some cases, an ensemble of conformations may be responsible for an observed
behavior.  Thus, a single, minimum energy conformation may be insufficient
for representing a molecule.
The purpose of the Conformational Search application is to generate
energetically reasonable 3D atomic configurations of molecular
systems comprising small molecules, multiple molecules, macrocycles, and
protein loops, with or without geometric constraints or fixed atoms.
</p>

<p>
The conformation space of a molecular system is continuous and cannot
be represented easily.  Fine discrete conformational samples, say of the
rotatable bonds, are impractical for all but the smallest of systems, and
systematically generating such &quot;coverage collections&quot; for large
complex systems is an unsolved problem.
Conformational Search produces a discrete sampling of the
space confined to local minima of the potential energy function.
For many properties, a collection of low energy local minima is often a
good representative of the entire conformation space.
</p>
<p>
The Conformational Search application contains three methods for
generating conformations, the output of each of which is subjected
to energy minimization:
</p>

<ol>
<li><i>Systematic Search</i>. Systematic generation of rotatable bond
dihedral angle combinations.
<li><i>Stochastic Search</i>. Random assignment of dihedral angle
combinations, even for rings, and stereochemistry inversions, where permitted.
<li><i>LowModeMD Search</i>. A short molecular dynamics simulation using
velocities with little kinetic energy on the high-frequency vibrational
modes.
</ol>

<p>
Each method has its advantages, disadvantages, and unique
capabilities, as summarized in the following table.
In the table, a &quot;Y&quot;
value indicates that the method is good at dealing with the condition
while an &quot;N&quot; indicates that the method is not particularly good
(although it may work formally).

<p>
Because of its generality and efficiency, LowModeMD Search is the
default and recommended method for conformation generation.

<!-- THEORY AND METHODS -->
<a name="Methods"><h2>Theory and Methods</h2></a>

<p>
In all methods, a Stochastic Sampling protocol is applied to
each molecule under consideration and proceeds as follows:
</p>

<ol>
<li>[Initialize]
Set the conformer list <i>C</i> to empty.
For the Systematic Search, identify all rotation bonds excluding rings and
determine a collection of dihedral angles for each rotation bond.
For Stochastic Search, identify all rotation bonds including rings
and invertible stereo centers.
Energy minimize the system until the RMSD gradient falls below the
RMS Gradient test parameter.

<p><li>[Generate]
Each particular method generates a single conformation in its own way;

<ul>
<li><i>Systematic Search</i>. 
For a randomly chosen dihedral angle,
systematically rotate about that bond in discrete angular
increments and perform an energy minimization of the
system.  
<!--
Generate the
next combination of dihedral angles and
energy minimize the system briefly in dihedral coordinates.</li>
-->
<li><i>Stochastic Search</i>. Randomly rotate all bonds (including ring
bonds) and randomly invert invertible stereochemistry centers.</li>
<li><i>LowModeMD Search</i>. Perform a brief molecular dynamics simulation
with velocities initialized to low-frequency vibrational modes.</li>
</ul>
</li></p>

<p><li>[Minimize]
Energy minimize the system in Cartesian coordinates until the RMS gradient
falls below the MSD Gradient test parameter.
</li></p>

<p><li>[Save]
If the current conformation has a strain energy greater than the
Strain Cutoff parameter, discard the conformation.  Otherwise,
check for duplicates in the conformer list, <i>C</i>.  Two conformations
are considered duplicates if the root mean square distance between them
(taking molecular symmetry into account) is less than the RMSD Limit
parameter.  Discard the current conformation if it is already in <i>C</i>.
A separate conformer list is maintained for each stereochemistry configuration.
</li></p>

<p><li>[Termination]
Terminate the algorithm if the total number of iterations exceeds the
Iteration Limit parameter.
For the Stochastic and LowModeMD methods, terminate the algorithm if
no novel conformation was observed in Rejection Limit parameter 
consecutive iterations.
Otherwise, go to Step&nbsp;2.
</li></p>

<p><li>[Descriptors]
Sort the conformation list <i>C</i> by strain energy and calculate
energetic and shape based descriptors for each conformation.
</li></p>
</ol>

<p>
We now describe each of the three methods in more detail.
</p>

<a name="Systematic"></a>
<p><b>Systematic Search</b>.
The Systematic Search method generates molecular conformations by rotating
non-ring bonds in a molecule by discrete dihedral increments (see below).
All possible combinations of the dihedral increments are produced.
Each such dihedral angle combination is subjected to dihedral angle energy
minimization to relieve gross strain due to atom overlap,
followed by an all-atom energy minimization.
The resulting conformation is saved to the output database provided 
it meets the energetic and geometric criteria.
<b>Note!</b> Systematic Search is intended for relatively small connected
molecules with few rotatable bonds (due to the exponential number of
configurations that will be generated); it is not suitable for macrocycles or
large systems with complex nonbonded interaction networks.
</p>
<p>
In a given molecule, all bonds except ring bonds and bonds to terminal
atoms are candidates for rotation.  For each such bond, a list of possible
relative dihedral angles is determined according to topological rules that
take into account hybridization and chemical type.  For example, a CH3-OH
bond might be assigned three dihedral angles {180,60,-60} degrees.
Because only dihedral rotations are used to generate conformations,
Systematic Search cannot perform non-planar (chiral) inversions;
however, double bonds and amide bonds can be optionally rotated.  The
following table summarizes the dihedral angle rules:

</table></center>

<p>
It should be kept in mind that the listed angles are merely starting
points for subsequent energy minimizations.  Consequently, precise angles
are not required since the conformation will be refined with the forcefield
to the nearest local minimum.  Typically, most (or all) of the local
minima can be identified (for small molecules not affected by restraints
or tethers); however, different starting conformations may produce slightly
different results (due to variations in bond lengths and angles).
</p>
<p>
Despite the systematic nature of the method, Systematic Search is generally
not the best method for generating conformations.  This is due to the fact
that there is inherent bias in the dihedral angle lists and no guarantee
that all local minima will be identified.  A finer set of angle increments
could be used in principle, however, fine lists quickly become impracticable
because of the exponential growth of the number of generated configurations.
Even with the coarse lists actually used, Systematic Search will spend
most of its time refining conformations that are far from the global minimum
and that will ultimately be rejected.
</p>

<a name="Stochastic"></a>
<p><b>Stochastic Search</b>.
The Stochastic Search method generates conformations by randomly rotating
all bonds (including ring bonds) and randomly inverting tetrahedral
centers followed by an all-atom energy minimization.
The resulting conformation is saved to the output database provided 
it meets the energetic and geometric criteria.
This method is superior to the RIPS method [Ferguson&nbsp;1989] which
generates new molecular conformations by randomly perturbing the Cartesian
coordinates of each atom by some small amount.
<b>Note!</b> Stochastic Search is intended for moderately sized connected
molecules; it is not suitable for macrocycles or large systems with
complex nonbonded interaction networks.  However, the Stochastic Search
method is capable of generating enantiomers (unlike the Systematic and
LowModeMD methods).
</p>
<p>
Typically, Stochastic Search is good at locating most of the local minima
of flexible (small) molecules, including ring conformations and invertible
tetrahedral centers (like tertiary nitrogens).  It does not suffer from the
biases of Systematic Search since continuous dihedral angle sampling is
used nor is it sensitive to the starting conformation.  However, a large
number of samples may be required to adequately search the conformation
space of flexible molecules.  Stochastic Search is generally not the most
efficient method for generating conformations because, like Systematic Search,
it spends most of its time refining conformations that are far from the
global minimum and that will ultimately be rejected.
</p>

<a name="LowModeMD"></a>
<p><b>LowModeMD Search</b>.
The LowModeMD Search method [Labute&nbsp;2010] generates conformations
using a short ~1&nbsp;ps run of Molecular Dynamics (MD) at constant
temperature [Allen&nbsp;1987] followed by an all-atom energy minimization.
The resulting conformation is saved to the output database provided 
it meets the energetic and geometric criteria.
<b>Note!</b> LowModeMD Search is intended for large, possibly disconnected,
and complex structures like macrocycles and protein loops but it is also
very efficient for detailed small molecule analysis.  However, chiral
inversions as well as amide and double bond rotations will very rarely
result.
</p>
<p>
The key to the success and efficiency of the LowModeMD method lies
in the nature of the initial MD velocities: randomly directed kinetic energy
is given mainly on the <i>low-frequency vibrational modes</i> of the
molecular system causing rapid and more realistic conformational transitions.
The second derivative matrix <b>G</b> of the potential energy function
of the system is evaluated at the current set of coordinates (presumed to
be near a local energy minimum).  Let <b>M</b> be a diagonal matrix of
atomic masses in which fixed atoms are taken to have infinite mass.
Diagonalize the mass-weighted second derivative matrix
</p>
<p align=center>
<b>M</b><sup>-1/2</sup> <b>G</b> <b>M</b><sup>-1/2</sup>
    = <b>Q</b><sup>T</sup> <b>D</b> <b>Q</b>
</p>
<p>
where <b>Q</b> is the orthogonal matrix of vibrational modes and
<b>D</b> is the diagonal matrix of force constants.  A filter function,
<i>f</i>, is applied to <b>D</b> which maps low-frequency force constants
to near unit values and high-frequency force constants to near-zero
values.
For a given velocity vector <i>v</i>, the velocity filter transformation
</p>
<p align=center>
<b>Q</b><sup>T</sup> <i>f</i>(<b>D</b>) <b>Q</b> <i>v</i>
</p>
will heavily dampen kinetic energy along
the high-frequency vibrational
modes.  Randomly generated Maxwell-Boltzmann velocities,
scaled to 300&nbsp;K and thusly transformed,
are used in the subsequent MD simulation.
</p>

<p>
LowModeMD Search is similar in spirit to the Stochastic Search and the Hybrid
Monte Carlo methods except that detailed information about
the possibly complex nonbonded interaction network, forcefield
restraints/tethers, macrocyclic structure and concerted motions are taken
into account.
LowModeMD Search is most similar to the LMOD method [Kolossvary&nbsp;1996]
with some important differences:
<ol>
<li>
LMOD made linear coordinate perturbations along eigenvectors
causing unrealistic distortions that prevented proper modeling of concerted
motions.  LowModeMD Search uses MD for the perturbation.
</li>
<p><li>
LMOD originally attempted to systematically search along all 2<sup>k</sup>
combinations of low-mode eigenvectors which rapidly became impracticable
necessitating the introduction of a stochastic sampling.
LowModeMD Search is designed to be stochastic with no partial
or incomplete enumeration attempt (this allows for much greater efficiency).
</li></p>
<p><li>
LMOD used large-scale iterative eigensystem calculations which
can be slow to converge and/or memory intensive.
LowModeMD Search uses an entirely implicit Chebyshev filtering
technique directly on the velocity vector thus eliminating the need for
any explicit eigensystem determination.
</li></p>
</ol>

<p>
Typically, LowModeMD Search is very good at locating most of the local minima
of arbitrarily complex multicomponent systems (provided sufficient sampling
is conducted).  This is because LowModeMD Search spends most of its time
on conformations near the relevant and realistic low energy states or
transitions between them.  There are no rule-based biases; however, it
is assumed that the conformations of interest are connected by
low-frequency vibrational mode transitions.  This assumption prevents
stereochemistry inversions and other stiff interconversions, but in most
applications this assumption is quite desirable.
For these reasons, LowModeMD Search is the recommended method for most
conformational search applications.
</p>

<p>
<a name="Descriptors"></a>
<b>Descriptors</b>.  
A number of descriptors are saved along with each conformation as it is
generated.  These descriptors are useful for analysis of the results.

<a name="ConfGeometries"></a><h2>Analyzing Conformation Geometries</h2>

<p>
The Conformation Geometries panel lets you analyze conformations that have been
generated by any of the methods available in MOE
and saved into a database.
After loading a sample conformation into MOE, you can use the panel to
conduct the following operations on the conformers in the database:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Measure distances, angles and dihedrals between selected atoms.
<li>Superpose conformations with the sample conformation and evaluate the RMSD.
<li>Label atoms in the database and MOE Window for calculation purposes.
</ul>

<p>The results of the measurements are saved back into the database.  Note
that the database <b>must</b> contain conformational data, i.e.
all molecules in the field used for the calculations must be the same
molecule; otherwise, incorrect values and error messages may result.
If the conformations of more than one molecule
are saved in the database, entry selection can be used to specify
the conformations of a single distinct molecule.

in the database containing the conformational data to measure.

<a name="Measuring"></a><h3>Measuring Structural Properties</h3>

<ol>

<p><li><a href="../mdb/dbedit.htm">Load the sample conformation</a>
from the database into MOE and select the
appropriate number of atoms depending on whether you wish to measure distance,
angle or dihedral angle:

<ul>

<p><li>To measure the <b>distance</b> between two atoms, simply select the
two atoms. Any two atoms may have the distance between them measured.

<p><li>To measure an <b>angle</b>, select three atoms: a vertex atom and
two other atoms bonded to it (but not forming a three-membered ring).

<p><li>To measure <b>dihedrals</b>, select four atoms which define a
proper dihedral angle.  MOE calculates a dihedral angle with respect to a
plane containing the first, second and third atoms and a plane containing
the second, third and fourth atoms.  The third and fourth atoms are
understood to be the atoms the farthest away from the viewer.

</ul>

<p><li>If the selected atoms define a distance, angle or dihedral angle
measurement, then the name of each selected atom will appear in the text area
next to the corresponding <b>Field</b> (Distance, Angle or Dihedral) in the
Conformation Geometries panel. This text string will be used as the name of the
field in the database, and may be modified if desired.

<p>For example, if a carbon and an oxygen are selected, the string <tt>C-O</tt>
will appear in the Distance Field and will be used as the database field
name. (This is assuming that atoms are named according to their element.)


<p><li>
To provide more precision as to which atoms are involved in the selected
measurement, use the <b>Auto Label</b> button to rename all atoms so that
their element name is followed by a number. Each atom is given a
distinct name in the molecular structure. This is done for all
conformations in the database so that corresponding atoms have
corresponding names.  Note, however, that although the atom names are
saved in the database, they are not displayed in the Database Viewer.

<p>Given the example above, where a carbon and oxygen are selected,
<tt>C1-O4</tt> might now appear in the Distance Field, where <tt>C1</tt> is the
first of <i>n<sub>c</sub></i> carbons in the system, and <tt>O4</tt> is the
fourth of <i>n<sub>o</sub></i> oxygens (<i>n<sub>c</sub></i> is the total
number of carbon atoms in the system and <i>n<sub>o</sub></i> is the total
number of oxygen atoms in the system).


<p><li>Click on the <b>Measure</b> button.  MOE performs the measurement for
each entry in the specified Molecule Field and saves the values to the database
in a field whose name is specified in the Measurement section of the panel.

</ol>

<a name="Superposing"></a><h3>Superposing Conformations</h3>

<ol>

<p><li>Copy the sample molecular structure from the conformational
database to MOE.  This molecule will be used as the
template structure onto which the other conformations will be superposed.
</li>

<p><li>For the superposition, you have the choice of aligning all atoms or
selected atoms only.  An additional option allows you to superpose
only the heavy atoms in either of these sets.
</li>

<p><li>
If you wish to record only the RMSD results in the database, and not the
molecular structures resulting from the superposition, choose <b>Output No
Structures</b> from the <b>Molecule Field</b> option menu.  For the
RMSD results to be written, a name must be provided for the <b>RMSD Field</b>.
</li>

<p><li>
If you wish to overwrite the current contents of the molecule field with
the superposed structures, choose <b>Overwrite Current Field</b> from the
<b>Molecule Field</b> option menu.
</li>

<p><li>
If you wish to save the superposed structures in a new molecule field,
choose <b>Create New Field</b> from the <b>Molecule Field</b> option menu.
Enter the name of the new field in the adjoining text area.
</li>

<p><li>Remove the name in the text area beside <b>RMSD Field</b> if you do
not want MOE to calculate the RMSD values.
</li>

<p><li>Press the <b>Superpose</b> button.  MOE performs the superposition
based on the options selected in the panel.
</li>

</ol>
