<p>
LigX is the name for a collection of procedures and capabilities in MOE
for conducting interactive ligand modification and energy minimization
in the active site of a flexible receptor.
LigX provides for:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Assigning coordinate restraints on atoms to discourage movement;</li>
    <li>Drawing molecular surfaces to highlight steric clashes;</li>
    <li>Interactive modification of ligands and geometry optimization;</li>
    <li>Estimating binding affinities and ligand properties.</li>
    <li>Control of multiple receptors and ligands.</li>
</ol>
<p>
In LigX calculations, the receptor atoms far from the ligand are held
fixed (constrained not to move) while receptor atoms near the ligand
(in the active site) are allowed to move but are subject to
<em>tether restraints</em> that discourage gross movement.
The ligand atoms can be configured as either free to move or subject to
similar tethers as the receptor.</p>

<a name="ButtonBar"></a>
<p>
Interactive structure-based design is generally conducted using the
MOE Window, in particular the MOE Button Bar.

<p>
A typical interactive modeling session will involve loading molecular data
into MOE, isolating a ligand in an active site, drawing molecular surfaces and
repeatedly making modifications to the ligand and optimizing the geometry
of the modifications using energy minimization.</p>
<p>
The molecular data will typically have atomic coordinate restraints applied
to ensure that the receptor or ligand scaffold atoms do not move too much.
These restraints are added as part of the LigX preparation procedure.
MOE files are capable of saving restraint information and molecular data from a previously prepared MOE session, and so may be used without
further preparation.</p>
<p>
Ligand properties (such as molecular weight, logP and TPSA) may be displayed
and Generalized Born binding affinity estimates can be calculated as part of
the energy minimization procedure.  Active site analysis applications like
Molecular Surfaces, Contact Statistics and Electrostatic Maps may be applied
and 2D protein-ligand interaction diagrams can be calculated.</p>

<h2><a name="Preparation"></a>
Data Preparation</h2>
<p>
MOE has been designed for working with multiple macromolecular receptor and
ligand molecules, which must first be loaded into MOE.
Typically, receptor-ligand complexes are initially read from PDB format files,
<a href="#LigX">prepared for use</a>
and stored in a MOE file (to save the preparation results).
LigX preparation data consists of restraint tethers on atoms, ligand
identification annotations, hydrogen atoms and refined coordinates.
Receptors and ligands can be read from different files (e.g. a receptor
from a PDB file and a ligand from a 3D MOL file).
It is worthwhile to expend some effort in preparing a receptor-ligand
complex and saving the results to a MOE file for subsequent use;
in this way, a good initial starting point can be used repeatedly without
having to prepare the structure each time.</p>

<h3><a name="OpenCloseSave"></a>
Open, Close and Save Files</h3>

<p>
<a name="Open"></a>
<div class="floatright">
<img src="ligx/fileopen.png" alt="File Open" />
</div>
The <span class="menu">MOE | RHS | Open</span> button raises the
<a href="../moe/gui/fileopen.htm">Open</a> panel.
Select a file in the list (or change directories prior to selecting a file)
and press <b>OK</b>.
Typically MOE, PDB, Tripos MOL2 or MDL MOL files
are relevant for structure based design.
Recent directories are available from the pull-down in the file name
text field.
</p><p>
<b>Note!</b> The MOE Button Bar is customizable and in some cases the
<b>Open</b> button may raise a custom panel different from the default.
</p><p>
The <span class="menu">MOE | RHS | Close</span> button will delete all
data in MOE (after a confirmation prompt).  Use 
<a href="#System"><span class="menu">MOE | RHS | System</span></a>
to delete a subset of the system (including related surfaces).
</p><p>
<b>Warning!</b> Once cleared, molecular data cannot be recovered
(unless it was previously saved to disk).</p>
</p><p>
<a name="Save"></a>
Use <span class="menu">MOE | File | Save</span> to save the contents of
the MOE Window to disk.  The data can be saved in one of a number of file
formats; however, if the data is not saved to a MOE file then LigX
annotations and preparations such as atom position tethers and ligand
identifications may be lost.
See <a href="filesave.htm">Saving the System</a> for more information.</p>

<!-- ============================= PREPARE ============================== -->

<h3>
<a name="LigX"></a>
LigX &ndash; Prepare Structures for SBD</h3>
<p>
Before performing calculations on receptor-ligand complexes in
an interactive structure-based design session, the
molecular data must be prepared.  If a structure is already prepared then
this preparation procedure can be skipped.
A prepared structure will have all of its hydrogens present;
use <span class="menu">MOE | RHS | Hydrogens</span> to check for
the presence of explicit hydrogens.
Unprepared files, such as PDB files, may contain missing atoms, alternate
geometry or other crystallographic artifacts.  See
<a href="../proteins/proprep.htm">Preparing Protein and Protein Complex Data</a>
for more details on preparing PDB files and correcting problems
(e.g., with ligand topology).
With reasonably good quality starting data, the following procedure
will be adequate for structure-based design:
</p>

<ol>
<li class="margin"><b>Verify&nbsp;Ligand</b>.
Often the ligand topology in PDB files is not correct (due to coordinate
errors and the lack of such information in PDB files).

Use <a href="../apps/view2d.htm"><span class="menu"
    >MOE | RHS | Ligand | 2D Molecules</span></a>
to calculate 2D depictions of the ligands in MOE.
Use <a href="#SiteView"><span class="menu">SiteView</span></a>
to isolate the ligands (stick) and their receptor environments (line) in
the MOE Window (Make sure that there are no atoms selected before
pressing <b>SiteView</b>.)
If bond orders, charges or connectivity of a ligand of interest are not
correct then the <a href="#Build">Builder</a> must be used to make corrections.
</li>
<li class="margin">
<a name="ChooseLigand"></a><b>Choose&nbsp;Ligand</b>.
LigX can handle multiple ligands; however,
many receptor-ligand complex files contain molecules that are not of
interest or are copies of a ligand of interest.
In such cases, the <b>SiteView</b> command will isolate and display
all such molecules.
Use <span class="menu">MOE | RHS | Ligand | Choose Ligand</span>
to manually select the ligand of interest.  To do this, clear the
atom selection and select the atoms of the ligand of interest.
(<tt>Ctrl</tt>+click will select all of the atoms of a ligand provided that
it is contained in a single residue.)
Alternatively, <a href="#System"><span class="menu">System</span></a>
can be used to select subsets of the atoms.
Then, issue the <b>Choose Ligand</b> command.
<p>
<b>Note!</b> Choose Ligand is implemented by setting all other ligands
to be considered as Receptor atoms.  They will still be part of the system
but will be considered as non-ligands by MOE.  If multiple complexes are
present, then &quot;other ligands&quot; means other ligands in the same
tag grouping  as defined in the <a href="#System"><b>System</b></a> popup.</p>
</li>
<li class="margin"><b>LigX</b>.
Use <span class="menu">MOE | RHS | LigX</span> to raise the
LigX preparation application.  LigX will delete distant solvent, add hydrogens,
install tethers, calculate charges and perform initial refinement of the system
(see below).
LigX can handle multiple independent complexes; however, it is usually
best to prepare each complex separately and save them to separate files.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
The purpose of the <span class="menu">MOE | RHS | LigX</span> is to
prepare one or more systems (defined by their tag in the
<a href="#System"><span class="menu">System</span></a>
popup) for structure-based design involving energy minimization.
The following panel will be raised:

<p align="center">
<img src="ligx/ligx_panel.png">
</p>

<p>
<table width=100% cellpadding=5>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Protonate</b>
<td valign="top">
Most macromolecular structure data do not contain
hydrogen atoms.  Additionally, the ionization state of protein residues
is often in question.
If enabled, the Protonate3D [Labute&nbsp;2008]
methodology will be used to determine ionization state and add hydrogens.
Otherwise, hydrogen atoms will be added in extended conformations according
to the current atomic ionization states.
If <span class="nobr"
    ><b>Allow ASN/GLN/HIS &quot;Flips&quot; in Protonate3D</b></span>
is enabled along with Protonate3D then terminal amides, sulfonamide
and imidazole groups will be permitted to
flip to optimize the hydrogen bond network.
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Delete</b>
<td>
Often, receptor-ligand complexes contain many water molecules.  Some of
these water molecules may be important to maintain receptor structure
or to mediate ligand interactions.  The remaining water molecules are
generally uninteresting and may be deleted.  If this option is enabled,
water molecules farther than 4.5&nbsp;&Aring; from any receptor or
ligand atom will be deleted.
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Tether</b>
<td>
Typically, receptor atoms are constrained during geometry optimization so
that they do not deviate too much from their initial (experimental) coordinates.
LigX will add tether restraints to the atoms of the system according
to the settings.
Use the respective checkboxes to enable the assignment of tethers to Receptor,
Ligand and Solvent atoms.  If a checkbox is not on, then
the corresponding tethers will
not be assigned.  If the <b>Hydrogens</b> checkboxes to the right are
not enabled, then hydrogen atoms will not be tethered.
<p>
The <b>Strength</b> and <b>Buffer</b> parameters control the strength and
shape of a tether restraint on an atom.  The greater the Strength the
less the atom will deviate from its initial coordinates.  The Buffer 
provides a means for "flat bottomed restraints" in which there is no force if
an atom is sufficiently close its initial coordinates.
The restraining potential is
    <i>K</i>&nbsp;max(0,&nbsp;<i>r</i>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<i>B</i>)<sup>3</sup>
    where
    <i>K</i> is the specified strength,
    <i>r</i> is the distance between a ligand or solvent atom
         and the tether center, and
    <i>B</i> is the value specified by <b>Buffer</b>;
	there is no force if
	<i>r</i>&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;<i>B</i>.
	For <i>r</i>&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;<i>B</i>&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 the potential is
	switched to a linear function of the distance <i>r</i>.
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Fix</b>
<td>
Even if tethers are applied to a system, generally atoms far away from
ligands can be held fixed (for efficiency).  If enabled, atoms farther
than the specified distance will be constrained to be fixed (whether or
not they have been assigned tethers).  A value of 0 will cause all non-ligand
atoms to be fixed.  An exception can be made for hydrogens near the ligand:
if <b>Hydrogens Close to Ligands will not be Fixed</b> is enabled, then
receptor hydrogen atoms within 4.5&nbsp;&Aring; of a ligand will be
free to move.
<p>
<b>Note!</b> If there is more than one ligand, then they will be treated
equally for the purposes of calculating &quot;far away from ligands&quot;.
Use <a href="#ChooseLigand"><b>Choose Ligand</b></a> to focus on a
particular ligand of interest (and treat the remaining ligands as the receptor).
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Refine</b>
<td>
If enabled, the results of the previous calculations will be subjected
to an energy minimization using the current
<a href="../moe/pot.htm">Potential&nbsp;Setup</a>.
Energy minimization will be terminated when the root mean square gradient
falls below the specified value.
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Save&nbsp;Settings</b><br><b>Standard&nbsp;Settings</b>
<td>
Before pressing the <b>OK</b> button, the current settings of the LigX
panel can be saved for use as default values on future runs of LigX.
Press <b>Save&nbsp;Settings</b> to store the values.
Press <b>Standard&nbsp;Settings</b> to restore the values to
&quot;factory defaults&quot;.
<p>
<b>Note!</b> The values will be retained even if <b>Cancel</b> is pressed.
In this way, the <b>LigX</b> button can be used as a kind of configuration
panel.  The tether values and RMS gradient test are used by
<a href="#Minimize"><b>Minimize</b></a> and
the <a href="#Constrain"><b>Constrain</b></a> menu commands.
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
Press <b>OK</b> to begin the calculation.  If there are multiple tag groups
in MOE, each will prepared separately from the others.
Once the calculation completes, use 
<a href="filesave.htm"><span class="menu"
    >MOE | File | Save</span></a>
to save the results.

<p>
In summary, a prepared molecular system will have one or more identified
ligands with correct topology, reasonable ionization states and proton
coordinates, tether restraints on the heavy atoms of the receptor
and no unimportant water molecules.  This prepared state configuration
is assumed for optimal display by the
<a href="#SiteView"><b>SiteView</b></a> rendering command and
energy <a href="#Minimize"><b>Minimize</b></a> procedures of LigX
as well as other applications in MOE.
</p>

<!-- ============================= VISUALIZATION ========================= -->

<h2><a name="Visualization"></a>
Visualization</h2>

<p>
The MOE Button Bar provides a number of commands for visualizing the
ligand and receptor active site.  The visualization commands are designed
to analyze active sites, protein-ligand interactions and to provide information
about which atoms have tether restraints (normally added in the
<a href="#LigX"><b>LigX</b></a> preparation steps).
For this section, we will assume that a prepared receptor-ligand complex
is in the MOE Window.  Also, a good working knowledge of the operation
of the <a href="../moe/gui/mainwin.htm">MOE Window</a> is assumed.
The angle of view and zoom of the MOE Window is controlled with the
<a href="../moe/gui/mouse.html">mouse</a> (see
<a href="../moe/gui/mainwin.htm">Rotating, Translating and Zooming Atoms</a>).
For more information on selecting atoms, see
<a href="../moe/gui/mainwin.htm#UsingMouse">Selecting Atoms Using the Mouse</a>.

<h3><a name="System"></a>
The System Popup &ndash; Control Multiple Complexes</h3>
<p>
<div class="floatright">
<img src="ligx/sys_popup.jpg" alt="System Popup" />
</div>
One of the most important buttons on the MOE Button Bar is the <b>System</b>
button: it raises the System popup which is used for rapid control of:
<ul>
<li>Visibility of atoms and surfaces.
<li>Active, Inert and Selected state of atoms (independent of visibility).
<li>Coloring and rendering mode of atoms.
<li>Names of chains and chain groupings.
</ul>

<p>
The <b>System</b> popup is a multifunctional list of the molecular objects
loaded in MOE.
In MOE, molecular objects are arranged in a hierarchy: the <i>system</i> is
a sequence of <i>chains</i> each of which is a sequence of <i>residues</i>
each of which is a sequence of <i>atoms</i>.  Generally speaking, the
chains correspond to the chains of proteins and residues to the amino acids.
Small molecules are generally confined to one residue (although not required).
Multiple small molecules (ligand or solvent) are often collected into
a single chain (to preserve PDB chain identifiers for example).
Each chain has an associated chain <i>name</i> and chain <i>tag</i>.
The tag is used to group chains (such as all chains from a specific PDB file).
The name is used to hold the chain letter and other name information.
</p><p>
The <b>System</b> popup, comprises a series of lines corresponding to
chain tags (boldfaced) or collections of atoms (non-boldfaced) listed
beneath the tag line; these lines can be hidden or shown in the list
(collapsed or expanded).  Tag lines operate on all chains, residues and
atoms in the tag, non-tag line operate on the appropriate collection
of atoms (Receptor, Ligand, etc.).

For non-tag lines, setting a New Tag will change the grouping; it will
move to a new group if the tag is unique, otherwise it will be moved
with the other lines with the same tag.
Non-tag lines have an associated chain name; setting a <b>New Name</b>
will change the chain name (sometimes displayed in the System popup, e.g.
with Ligands or in the full expansion mode).
<b>Note!</b>  Setting a New Tag or New Name can cause new chains to
be created in MOE; for example, if two ligands are in the same chain
and one is renamed.

The <span class="menu">MOE | RHS | SiteView</span> is a kind of
&quot;reset&quot; or &quot;home base&quot; for structure-based ligand
design.
<b>SiteView</b> renders the molecular system according to a convention which
is designed to provide feedback regarding which atoms belong to the
receptor and which atoms are ligand atoms as well as to focus on the
active sites of receptor-ligand complexes.  First ensure that no atoms
selected.  Pressing <b>SiteView</b> will
<ol>
<li>
Isolate the ligand in the active site by hiding distant receptor and solvent
atoms.  Distant backbone ribbons will be hidden.
</li><li>

</li>
</ol>
<p>
Use the <a href="#System"><span class="menu">System</span></a> to color
the receptor carbons differently from the ligand (e.g., dark green).
<b>Note!</b> In previous version of MOE, this color was integrated with
the Active Site button.  This coloring is not performed by SiteView
in order to support multiple receptor-ligand complexes.
<p>
<b>SiteView</b> will affect all atoms in the system and take all atoms

The <span class="menu">MOE | RHS | Surface</span> menu provides commands
to create surfaces around receptors and ligands in the system.  These
&quot;Quick&quot; surfaces are those most useful in structure-based
design and are created with coloring designed to show the color of
atoms in the system:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Receptor</b>.  Creates a Connolly-type molecular surface using
receptor atoms only near any ligand atom in the system.
The surface is colored by nearest atom with hydrogen bond information
(direction of polar hydrogens and lone pairs) overlayed.
<p>
<li><b>Ligand</b>.  Creates a Connolly-type molecular surface using
ligand atoms only.
The surface is colored by nearest atom with hydrogen bond information
(direction of polar hydrogens and lone pairs) overlayed.
<p>
<li><b>Interaction (VDW)</b>.  Creates an accessible surface (line mode)
using receptor atoms only near any ligand atom in the system.
This surface shows the onset of van der Waals clash (a 0-potential energy
contour of the van der Waals interaction energy with a water molecule probe).
The color of the surface is the same as that shown in the
<a href="#System"><span class="menu">System</span></a> popup.
</ul>
<p>
More sophisticated surfaces such as Electrostatic Maps and Contact Statistics
can be created with the <a href="surfmap.htm">Surfaces and Maps</a>
application, which provides more coloring options and transparency settings.
Surfaces and Maps can also be used to change the coloring, transparency
and material properties of the surfaces created in the <b>Surface</b> menu.
This application can be started with the <b>Surfaces and Maps</b>
command in the <b>Surface</b> menu.

<p>
<b>Note!</b>  Inactive receptors and ligands are ignored and no surface
will be created.  A receptor or ligand is considered inactive if it
has no active atoms (as shown in the
<a href="#System"><span class="menu">System</span></a> popup).

<p>
<b>Note!</b>
Each active receptor or ligand is treated separately and a
separate surface will be created for each one.

<p>
<b>Note!</b> The surfaces not automatically update if the atomic coordinates
change.  Issue the command again to update the surface (which will
delete the old surface).

<p>
To delete Quick surfaces:
<ul>
<li>Use the <b>Clear</b> command in the <b>Surface</b> menu.

<h3><a name="Properties"></a>
Ligand Properties</h3>

<p>
The <span class="menu">MOE | RHS | Ligand | Ligand Properties</span>
command toggles the display of calculated ligand properties.  Issue
the command once to enable the property display and again to disable it.
Properties will be automatically calculated if there is a single active
ligand in the system.  If there is more than one (or none at all) a
message will be displayed and the properties will not be calculated.
Use <span class="menu">MOE | RHS | System</span> to activate or de-activate
ligands so that there is only one active ligand.
</p><p>
<div class="floatright">
<img src="ligx/ligprop.jpg" alt="LigX Properties" />
</div>
The calculated 2D ligand properties are displayed in the top left corner
of the MOE Window.
Use <span class="nobr"><b>MOE | Render | Setup</b></span> to
configure the color of the properties text (if, for example, they
cannot be seen on the current background).
See <a href="../appendix/viewsetup.htm">Visualization Setup</a>.
The font properties (size, bold, etc.) can be controlled in
<span class="nobr"><b>MOE | Render | Draw</b></span>.
</p><p>
The properties divide into two categories: those that depend only on the ligand
connectivity and topological state (2D) and those that depend on coordinates
and interactions with the receptor (3D).  The 2D properties are continuously
updated as the ligand is modified with the <a href="#Build">Builder</a>; the
3D properties are updated after each
<a href="#Minimize">energy minimization</a> using the MOE Button Bar or the
Builder.
</p><p>
The calculated 2D properties are
<a href="../quasar/descr.htm">MOE Descriptors</a> relevant to
structure-based drug design:</p>
<ul>
<li><tt>toxic</tt> &ndash;
An assessment of the toxicity or mutagenicity of the ligand
using a rule-based method [Kazius&nbsp;2005].
</li>
<li><tt>rsynth</tt> &ndash;
Estimated ease of synthesis as a percentage of heavy atoms traced to
starting materials after retrosynthetic analysis.
</li>
<li><tt>weight</tt> &ndash;
The molecular weight calculated with values from
the CRC Handbook [CRC&nbsp;1994].
</li>
<li><tt>TPSA</tt> &ndash;
The topological polar surface area [Ertl&nbsp;2000].
Hydrogen bond donor and acceptor counts are to the right.
</li>
<li><tt>logP</tt> &ndash;
The log octanol/water partition coefficient calculated with
the Wildman and Crippen model [Wildman&nbsp;1999].
</li>
<li><tt>logS</tt> &ndash;
The log solubility coefficient calculated with the
method of Hou <i>et al</i> [Hou&nbsp;2004].
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Additional 3D properties are calculated after each
<a href="#Minimize"><b>Minimize</b></a>.  If the ligand is subsequently
modified then these additional properties will no longer be displayed
and another energy minimization must be performed so that they can
be recalculated.  The energy minimization will optimize the potential
energy of the receptor-ligand complex.  From the resulting coordinates,
several properties are calculated:
</p>
<ul>
<li><tt>strain</tt> &ndash;
The local strain energy of the ligand conformation.  The ligand is
subjected to energy minimization, isolated from the rest of the molecular
system.  The strain energy is the difference between the
ligand conformation energy in the bound state and the energy of the
isolated local minimum.  The value in parentheses to the right
is the strain energy divided by the number of heavy atoms in the ligand
(the strain efficiency).  The <tt>rmsd</tt> at the far right is the
superposition distance between the bound conformation and the
isolated local minimum conformation.
</li>
<p>
<li><tt>solvation</tt> &ndash;
The molecular mechanics generalized Born interaction energy
is the non-bonded interaction energy between the receptor and the ligand
and comprises van der Waals, Coulomb and generalized Born implicit solvent
interaction energies [Labute&nbsp;2008].  Ligand and receptor strain
energies are not taken into account.
The parenthetical value to the right is the interaction energy
divided by the number of heavy atoms in the ligand (interaction efficiency).
Solvent molecules are ignored in the calculation.
<p>
<li><tt>affinity</tt> &ndash;
The estimated binding affinity is that of the
London&nbsp;dG scoring function [Labute&nbsp;2006] reported in
units of kcal/mol.
The parenthetical value to the right is the affinity divided by the
number of heavy atoms in the ligand (the efficiency).
Solvent molecules are ignored in the calculation.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Note!</b> It is possible to customize the Ligand Properties display
by using custom SVL functions.  In such a case, the number and type of the
properties may be different from the description above.

<h3><a name="RVectors"></a>
Ligand R-Vectors</h3>

<p>
Modifications to ligands such as the addition of functionals may result
in poor steric interactions with the receptor.  The purpose of the
R-Vector display is to provide information about potential steric
clash at substitution locations on a ligand.
</p>
<p>
<div class="floatright">
<img src="ligx/ligrvec.jpg" alt="Ligand R-Vectors" />
</div>
The <span class="menu">MOE | RHS | Ligand | Ligand R-Vectors</span>
command toggles the display of &quot;exit vectors&quot; on active
ligand molecules.  These graphical arrows are drawn along
visible Q&ndash;H bonds when a methyl substitution is likely to be
free of steric clash.
R-Vectors will only be displayed along <i>visible</i> explicit hydrogens.
Select a ligand of interest and use
<span class="menu">MOE | RHS | Hydrogens</span>
until all hydrogens are visible.
</p>
For each hydrogen attached to a ligand, a virtual methyl group is positioned
along the heavy atom to hydrogen bond with the appropriate bond length.
A van der Waals interaction energy is calculated with every active atom in the
system (leaving out 1-2, 1-3 and scaling the virtual 1-4 interactions).
If the resulting energy is less than 2&nbsp;kcal/mol, the hydrogen is
deemed to be a candidate attachment point.  This energy threshold can
be adjusted on the Builder page of the
<a href="../appendix/moeconfig.htm">Configuration Options</a> panel.
</p>
<p>
<b>Note!</b> All active atoms will interact with the virtual methyls,
even overlayed ligands.  Use the
<span class="menu">System</span> popup to activate or deactivate
ligands and receptors.
<p>
The information displayed by the Ligand R-Vectors is similar to that of the
<a href="#Surface">Interaction (VDW) surface</a> and the same parameters
are used (van der Waals radii and well depths).  However, it is important
to keep in mind that a virtual methyl group may clash with the ligand
itself (not just the receptor).  A clash with the ligand means that
some sort of conformational change is required.
Thus, the lack of an R-Vector may also mean that some sort of ligand movement
(translation, rotation, conformational) is required to accommodate the
methyl group.

<h3><a name="Duplicate"></a>
Duplicate a Ligand</h3>

<p>
Use <span class="menu">MOE | RHS | Ligand | Duplicate</span> to create
a copy of a ligand.  A single connected ligand must be selected in the
MOE Window or an error will result.  The ligand atoms, residues and
chains are duplicated along with membership in any atom sets, restraints,
tethers, etc.  The chain name of the newly created ligand will have
a numeric copy number appended; for example, a copy of <tt>MyLigand</tt>
will be given the chain name <tt>MyLigand&nbsp;(2)</tt>.
The original ligand will be hidden and de-activated (made inert) and
the created copy will have all of its atoms selected.

<h3><a name="MinimizeV"></a>
Minimize in Isolation</h3>

<p>
Use <span class="menu">MOE | RHS | Ligand | Minimize (Vac)</span> to create
a duplicate of a ligand and energy minimize its coordinates in isolation
(without any receptor or other atoms).
A single connected ligand must be selected in the
MOE Window or an error will result.
The ligand is duplicated in manner similar to the <b>Duplicate</b>
command.  The newly created copy is energy minimized and superposed back
onto the original.
The chain name of the newly created ligand will have <tt>(Vac)</tt>
appended; for example, <tt>MyLigand</tt> will become
<tt>MyLigand&nbsp;(Vac)</tt>.
The newly created minimized copy will be de-activated (made inert).

<p>
When the minimization is complete, a message will be displayed at the
top left of the MOE Window for ~5 seconds and printed to the SVL Commands
Window.  The message has the form
<blockquote>
<pre>
Minimize (Vac): Estrain: ss.sss kcal/mol (e.eee)  rmsd: d.ddd
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
where
<tt>ss.sss</tt> is the strain energy (energy of original conformation
less the energy of the minimized conformation),
<tt>e.eee</tt> is the strain efficiency: strain energy divided by the
number of heavy atoms,
<tt>d.ddd</tt> is the root mean square deviation between the original
conformation and the minimized conformation.

<!-- ========================= LIGAND MODIFICATION ======================= -->

<h2><a name="ModLig"></a>
Ligand Modification and Constrained Energy Minimization</h2>

<p>
The MOE Right Button Bar provides a number of commands for performing energy
minimization calculations and ligand modifications.  It is assumed
there is a receptor-ligand complex in the MOE Window that has been
prepared with the <a href="#LigX">LigX</a> preparation procedure.
Press the <a href="#SiteView"><b>SiteView</b></a> button to
isolate the ligand in the active site.

The <a href="#Properties"><span class="menu"
    >MOE | RHS | Ligand | Ligand Properties</span></a> command can be used to
display and monitor ligand properties in the MOE Window. The LigX
protocol for ligand modification is</p>

<ol>
<li>Decide which receptor and ligand atoms will be fully flexible.</li>
<li>Use the small molecule
    <a href="../moe/molsystems/build.html">Builder</a>
    to modify the ligand.</li>
<li>Use <span class="menu">MOE | RHS | Minimize</span> to perform
    constrained energy minimization to optimize the receptor-ligand
    complex.</li>
</ol>

<p>
<a name="Constrain"></a>
The <span class="menu">MOE | RHS | Constrain</span> menu is used to change the
constraint status of selected atoms in the MOE Window.  An atom can be either
<i>tethered</i>, <i>fixed</i> or <i>free</i>.  Tethered atoms will be subject to
artificial forces during <a href="#Minimize">energy minimization</a> to
prevent gross movement; fixed atoms will not move at all; free atoms are
not restrained in any manner.
The strength and other parameters of the tether restraint is specified in the
<a href="#LigX">LigX</a> panel.
<p>
The <b>Render</b> command in the <b>Constrain</b> menu can be used to
render the tethered and free atoms differently to reflect their state:</p>

<table style="margin:0 auto; text-align:center">
    <tr>
	<td class="image"><img src="ligx/line.gif" alt="line mode atoms" /></td>
	<td class="image"><img src="ligx/ballstick.gif" alt="ball and stick atoms" /></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
	<td class="caption">tethered</td>
	<td class="caption">free</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>
Heavy atoms (non-hydrogen) are rendered in Line mode if they are tethered,
or Ball and Stick mode if they are free.
Ligand hydrogen atoms are rendered in Line mode if they are tethered
and Ball and Stick mode if they are free.
Receptor hydrogen atoms are rendered in the same style as the heavy atom
to which they are attached.</p>

<p>
To <b>remove tether restraints</b> from atoms,
<a href="../moe/gui/mainwin.htm#UsingMouse">select the atoms</a>
in the MOE Window and use <span class="nobr"><b>Constrain | Free</b></span>
on the button bar.  This can be used to allow receptor active site atoms
free movement; for example, to allow a fully flexible residue sidechain.</p>

<p>
To <b>add tether restraints</b> to atoms,
<a href="../moe/gui/mainwin.htm#UsingMouse">select the atoms</a>
in the MOE Window and use <span class="nobr"><b>Constrain | Tether</b></span>
on the button bar.  Generally, hydrogen atoms need not be tethered, allowing
them full flexibility to form hydrogen bonds.  It is also good practice
to tether a few ligand heavy atoms if certain interactions are to
be ensured.</p>

<p>
To <b>fix atoms</b> to atoms,
<a href="../moe/gui/mainwin.htm#UsingMouse">select the atoms</a>
in the MOE Window and use <span class="nobr"><b>Constrain | Fix</b></span>
on the button bar.
Use <span class="nobr"><b>Constrain | Unfix</b></span> to remove
the fixed status without affecting any assigned tether.

<a name="Build"></a>
Use <span class="menu">MOE | RHS | Builder</span> to start the small
molecule <a href="../moe/molsystems/build.html">Builder</a> which is
used to make modifications to the ligand;
it can also be used to make minor modifications to the receptor.
The <span class="menu">MOE | Footer</span> is selection-sensitive
and can also be used to
edit bond lengths, angles and dihedrals: select 2, 3 or 4 atoms
and use the controls provided.
Alternatively, the <a href="rotamer.htm">Rotamer Explorer</a> can be used
to explore alternative sidechain conformations or make residue mutations.
Modifications to ligands are made by selecting atoms in the MOE Window
and changing their properties in the Builder.  Substitutions are made by
selecting hydrogen atoms in the MOE Window and selecting a chemical
group in the Builder.
See <a href="../moe/molsystems/build.html">Building and Editing Molecules</a>
for information on how to use the Builder.</p>

<p>
<a name="Minimize"></a>
The <span class="menu">MOE | RHS | Minimize</span> button will optimize the
coordinates of the molecular data in the MOE Window.  The
<b>Minimize</b> button in the
<a href="../moe/molsystems/build.html">Builder</a> is equivalent.
Typically, the <span class="menu">MOE | RHS | System</span> popup
is used to activate or de-activate receptors and ligands so that there
is only one set of active receptor, ligand and solvent atoms.

<p>
<img src="ligx/ligrec1.jpg" style="float:right" alt="LigX receptor setup" />
The <a href="#Preparation">LigX prepare procedure</a> is typically used
to set up for the following protocol:
<ol>
<li class="margin">
Receptor and solvent atoms far from the ligand are held fixed (constrained
to not move at all).  Typically, an atom is held fixed if it is at least
8&nbsp;&Aring; from any ligand atom.</li>

<li class="margin">
Atoms not held fixed in Step&nbsp;1 will be subject to any restraints
that have been set by the prepare procedure or the
<a href="#Constrain"><b>Constrain</b></a> commands.
The <span class="menu">Constrain | Render</span> button can be used
to visualize the tethered status of atoms.
</li>

<li class="margin">A forcefield energy minimization is performed which will
stop when the root mean square (RMS) gradient of the potential energy
falls below a certain threshold, by default
0.1&nbsp;kcal/mol&Aring; (configurable in the
<a href="#LigX"><span class="href">LigX</span></a> panel).
The current <a href="../moe/pot.htm">Potential&nbsp;Setup</a>
determines the forcefield, solvation model and non-bonded interaction cutoff.
</ol>

<p>
The <b>Cancel</b> menu in the top right corner of the MOE Window can be
used to terminate an energy minimization before it has completed.</p>

<p>
If the energy minimization calculation terminates normally, and the
Ligand Properties are displayed
(using the
<a href="#Properties"><span class="menu"
    >MOE | RHS | Ligand | Ligand Properties</span></a> button)
then binding affinity estimates are calculated and the display updated.

<b>Note!</b> If an energy minimization is performed but the Ligand Properties
are not displayed, then enable their display and then press
<b>Minimize</b> again.</p>
