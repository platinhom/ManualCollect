This document describes the BREED application.  The purpose of BREED is
to generate novel structures from a set of aligned ligands in 3D, possibly
bound to a common target receptor.  The input geometries are assumed to
be significant, thus new structures should preserve intramolecular
orientations as closely as possible.  The user can specify QuaSAR
descriptor, Model file and/or Pharmacophore query filters to limit the
results.  If a receptor is present, structures can be refined in the
binding cleft as with docking calculations.  Thus, BREED can be used as
part of a ligand-based or structure-based discovery methodology.

<!-- ============================= METHODOLOGY -=========================== -->

<p>
<a name="Method"></a>
<h2>Methodology</h2>

<p>
BREED takes the idea of "crossover" from the field of Genetic Algorithms
to generate new structures [Pierce&nbsp;2004].  New ligands are generated
by combining parts of existing ligands:

<p align=center><img src="breed/breed4.png"></p>

with crossover points defined by all superimposed (in 3D) bond pairs:

<p align=center><img src="breed/breed5.png"></p>

the highlighted bonds are considered superimposed and the right-side fragments
are exchanged to create two new structures.

<p>
<table>
<tr>
<td valign=right>
Two bonds are considered to be superimposed if they meet the following
criteria:

<ol start=1>
<li><i>r<sub>1</sub></i>, the distance between terminal atoms A<sub>1</sub>
and B<sub>1</sub> and <i>r<sub>2</sub></i>, the distance between terminal
atoms A<sub>2</sub> and B<sub>2</sub> are less than <i>d<sub>cut</sub></i>,
the user-specified distance cutoff.
</li><p>
<li><i>&theta;</i>, the angle between the two bonds, is less than
<i>&theta;<sub>cut</sub></i>, the user-specified angle cutoff.
</li></ol>
<td valign=left>
<img src="breed/breed2.png" align=left>
</tr>
</table>

Breeding bonds A<sub>1</sub>&ndash;B<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub>&ndash;
B<sub>2</sub> creates two new structures: A<sub>1</sub>&ndash;B<sub>2</sub>
and A<sub>2</sub>&ndash;B<sub>1</sub>.  Atomic coordinates for the terminal
atoms of the new bonds are generated by averaging the initial coordinates:

<p align=center><img src="breed/breed6.png"></p>

with the new structures indicated by green and orange and the shared bond
in purple.
<p>
The coordinate-averaging used by the breeding process generates
higher-energy structures that preserve essentially all of the intermolecular
orientation of the starting structures.  In order to create lower-energy
structures with as little global change as possible, tethered minimization
with a variable force constant can be used:

<p align=center><img src="breed/breed7.png"></p>

where <i>r</i> is the distance of each atom from the bond centroid formed
by the four atoms of the bond pair being bred.  The tether weight, <i>k</i>,
is calculated by <i>k</i> = <i>k<sub>0</sub>r<sup>p</sup></i>, with
defaults of 5.0 for <i>k<sub>0</sub></i> and 2 for <i>p</i>.  This allows
the indicated region near the bond centroid to relax relatively freely
while preserving the more-distant fragment geometries.
<p>
<div class="floatright"><img src="breed/breed_bond.png"></div>

For simplicity, BREED ignores ring and ionic
(i.e. S<sup>+</sup>&ndash;O<sup>-</sup>) bonds.  Like <i>de novo</i> design
tools, BREED can create structures that can be difficult to synthesize.
Bond selection can be limited to synthetically accessible bonds
by applying the RECAP rules [Lewell&nbsp;1998] to the input structures.
Bonds labeled by RECAP are collected into related groups, which are used to
determine which bonds can exchange fragments.  For example, the
two molecules pictured here
contain related groups (amide and ester).  These share
a superimposed bond which would thus be selected for fragment exchange.

<p>
If a protein structure is provided, the aligned input structures are
assumed to define the location and extent of the binding pocket.
<a href="../apps/docking.htm#Refinement"> Forcefield Refinement</a>
can be used to relax each new molecule in the pocket.
Sidechains can be treated flexibly (with or without a tether), but backbone
atoms are always held fixed.  This generates an energy score using the
<a href="../moe/pot.htm#Equation">Generalized Born solvation model (GB/VI)</a>
[Labute&nbsp;2008].  This value, along with the protein coordinates if
the sidechains were not fixed, is written to the output database.
Output structures can also be
<a href="../apps/docking.htm#Scoring"> Scored</a> using one of the methods
in MOE's <a href="../apps/docking.htm">Docking</a> application.
can be performed for each new structure.  If refinement is used,
<a href="../moe/pot.htm#Equation"> MM/GBVI</a>
energies are calculated for each protein/ligand pair.

<p>
BREED is implemented in MOE as a multi-step process:

<ol start=1>
<li>Generate the valid bond subset from the input structures.
Determine candidate pairs: bonds that are the same bond order and
RECAP class (if appropriate).  Discard pairs that are not superimposed.
</li><p>
<li>For all superimposed candidates that contain non-redundant
fragments, exchange those on each side of the bond and save
unique structures.
</li><p>
<li>Filter the structures by user-specified QuaSAR descriptors, model file
and/or pharmacophore filters.  Structures failing any of these filters
are discarded.
</li><p>
<li>By default, perform a short tethered minimization to generate low-energy
structures that maintain input fragment orientations as closely as possible.
</li><p>
<li>If a protein is present, relax each structure in the cleft (with 
side-chain flexibility if desired), calculate an MM/GBVI energy, score
the pose and calculate a fit metric.
</li></ol>
<p>
Superimposed bond pairs having identical left- or right side fragment
SMILES strings are ignored, as they automatically create duplicates
of the starting structures.

<p>
<a name="Example"></a>

A database viewer of

the calculation proceeds to create and minimize roughly 10 structures.
Examine the names of the output structures: all contain two names,
listing the input molecule pair used by BREED.  Note
that this name is shared by all structures created by breeding
different bonds in the same pair of input structures:
