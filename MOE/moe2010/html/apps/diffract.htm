<h2>
<a name="BasicDiffraction">
Basic Principles of Diffraction
</a>
</h2>

<p>
A diffraction pattern is the image obtained from shining
short-wavelength radiation through a material and projecting the
resulting pattern onto a surface.  The incident radiation is
scattered by the atoms constituting the material, and the coherently
scattered rays generate a unique interference pattern for a given
crystal of a given substance.

<h3>
<a name="Radiation">
Radiation Used in Diffraction Studies
</a>
</h3>

<p>
Three kinds of radiation are commonly used in crystal diffraction
studies: X-ray, electron, and neutron.

<p>
X-rays are scattered by the electrons, or, more specifically, by the
electron density distributions around the nuclei of atoms.  The
approximate range of wavelengths is 0.1 to 100 angstroms, but in
practice, only wavelengths in the range 0.5 to 3 angstroms are
used.  The wavelengths 0.8 to 2.0 angstroms are of particular
interest to crystallographers [Stout and Jensen, 1989], being on the order
of inter-atomic separations and therefore well-suited for diffraction
studies.

<p>
Electrons are scattered by the nuclei of atoms. The Coulombic potential of
an atom nucleus determines an atom's electron scattering power. The
wavelength of a beam of electrons is much shorter than that of X-rays,
providing, in principle, a commensurately greater resolving power.
Electron diffraction, however, requires very thin specimens and is more
sensitive than X-rays to physical effects that reduce observed diffracted
intensities.

<p>
Neutrons are also scattered by atom nuclei. The wavelength of neutron
radiation is generally about 1 angstrom.  There are two primary
applications for neutron diffraction: the study of magnetic crystals
(neutrons interact with magnetic fields whereas X-rays do not) and the
study of materials containing light atoms (neutron scattering interaction
is not proportional to atomic number; lighter elements may have
greater scattering power than heavier ones).

<h3> <a name="XrayScattering"> X-ray Scattering </a> </h3>

<p>
We will examine the case of X-rays, with the
understanding that the principles apply analogously to electron and
neutron diffraction.

<p>
When an X-ray beam impinges on a material, part of the incident power is
scattered.  The ratio of the power in the scattered beam to that in the
incident beam is called the <em>scattering power</em> of the material. The
intensity <em>I</em> of the scattered radiation is a function of amplitude
<em>A</em> of the scattered radiation (<em>K</em> is some constant of
proportionality):

<center><blockquote>
<em>I</em> = <em>K</em> <em>A</em><sup>2</sup>
</center></blockquote>

<p>
In the first approximation, we can consider X-rays as being scattered by
point atoms, or, equivalently, by point electrons at the locations of the
scattering atoms.  The amplitude of the radiation scattered by an electron
density distribution can then be expressed in terms of that scattered by a
point electron, scaled by a term that is a function solely of the
magnitude of the <em>scattering vector</em> <b>s</b>.  The scattering
vector is the vector difference between the incident ray (represented by
vector <b>S</b><sub>0</sub>) and the associated scattered ray (represented
by vector <b>S</b><sub>s</sub>):

<center><blockquote>
<b>s</b> = <b>S</b><sub>s</sub>-<b>S</b><sub>0</sub>
</center></blockquote>

<p>
This implies that the scattering intensity <em>I</em> varies with the
angle that the scattered beam makes with respect to the incident beam.
The amount of variance in <em>I</em> is different for each element, and is
encapsulated in a scale factor called the <em>atom scattering
factor</em>.  The atom scattering factor describes the scattering power of
an atom as a function of scattering angle.  Using these scattering
factors, an expression for the radiation scattered by the electron density
distribution of an entire crystal array of atoms can be constructed.

<h3><a name="AtomScatteringFactors"> Atom Scattering Factors</a></h3>

<p>
If atoms are assumed to be spherical, the scattering power of an atom is
characterized by a scattering factor <em>f<sub>a</sub></em> which is a
function solely of element and of scattering angle, and not of the position
of the atom. The scattering factor is expressed in terms of the scattering
power of an equivalent number of electrons located at the position of the
atom nucleus. At angle 0, <em>f<sub>a</sub></em> is always equal to the
total number of electrons in the atom.  <em>f<sub>a</sub></em> decreases
as the angle of incidence increases, due to the destructive interference
of radiation scattered from different parts of the electron cloud.  The
size of the electron cloud therefore has an impact on the scattering
factor -- an atom that has a relatively diffuse cloud of electrons has a
faster-decaying scattering factor than one with electrons more tightly
bound.

<p>
Note: Since neutron scattering occurs at the point-like nucleus,
neutron scattering factors are independent of scattering angle.

<h3><a name="StructureFactors">Structure Factors</a></h3>

<p>
The actual expression for the amplitude of the radiation scattered from a
single atom <em>A</em> in a crystal unit cell, expressed in terms of that
scattered from a single electron at the origin of the unit cell, is:

<p><center><img src="diffract/structurefactors1.gif"></center>

<!-- LATEX diffract/structurefactors1 \[
    f_A \; e^{\textstyle 2 \pi \mathrm{i} (\mathbf{r}_A \cdot \mathbf{s})}
\] ENDLATEX -->

<p>where

<ul>
  <p><li><i>f<sub>A</sub></i> is the scattering factor of atom <em>A</em>

  <li><b>r</b><sub><i>A</i></sub> is the position vector giving the
location of the atom

  <li>i is the complex number: i = Re 0 + Im 1

  <li><b>s</b> is the scattering vector
  </ul>

<p>
If there are <i>N</i> atoms in the unit cell, we can write:

<p><center><img src="diffract/structurefactors2.gif"></center>

<!-- LATEX diffract/structurefactors2 \[
    F_{hkl} =
    \sum_{j=1}^N f_j \;
	e^{\textstyle 2 \pi \mathrm{i} (\mathbf{r}_j \cdot \mathbf{s})}
\] ENDLATEX -->


<p>
The quantity <em>F<sub>hkl</sub></em> is called the <em>structure
factor</em>, and integers <em>h</em>, <em>k</em>, and <em>l</em> the
<em>indices of reflection</em>.  These <em>hkl</em> values are integers
defined by the <a href="#ScatteringGeometry">scattering geometry</a>,
described below.

<p>
Since <em>F<sub>hkl</sub></em> is a complex exponential, we can write:

<p><center><img src="diffract/structurefactors3.gif"></center>

<!-- LATEX diffract/structurefactors3 \[
    F_{hkl} = A_{hkl} + \mathrm{i} \, B_{hkl}
\] ENDLATEX -->

<!-- WLATEX diffract/structurefactors3 \[
\] ENDWLATEX -->

<p>
where

<p><center><img src="diffract/structurefactors4.gif"></center>
<p><center><img src="diffract/structurefactors5.gif"></center>

<!-- LATEX diffract/structurefactors4 \[
    A_{hkl} = \sum_j f_j \; \cos
	\left( 2 \pi (h \mathrm{x}_j + k \mathrm{y}_j + l \mathrm{z}_j) \right)
\] ENDLATEX -->

<!-- LATEX diffract/structurefactors5 \[

\] ENDLATEX -->


<p>
x<sub>j</sub>, y<sub>j</sub>, and z<sub>j</sub> are the coordinates of
atoms with respect to the origin of the crystal unit cell.

<p>
The magnitude and phase of the structure factor are:

<p><center><img src="diffract/structurefactors6.gif"></center>

<!-- LATEX diffract/structurefactors6 \[
    \left| F_{hkl} \right| = \sqrt{ A^2_{hkl} + B^2_{hkl} }
\] ENDLATEX -->

<p>phase <em>F<sub>hkl</sub></em> =
    atan (<em>B<sub>hkl</sub></em> / <em>A<sub>hkl</sub></em>)
</center>
<p><center><img src="diffract/structurefactors7.gif"></center>

<!-- LATEX diffract/structurefactors7 \[
    \mathrm{phase}\;  F_{hkl} =
    \mathrm{atan} \left( B_{hkl} / A_{hkl} \right)
\] ENDLATEX -->

<p>
<p>
The intensity <em>I<sub>hkl</sub></em> of a particular reflection is
proportional to the square of the structure factor:

<p><center><img src="diffract/structurefactors8.gif"></center>

<!-- LATEX diffract/structurefactors8 \[
    I_{hkl} \propto F^2_{hkl} = A^2_{hkl} + B^2_{hkl}
\] ENDLATEX -->

<p>
where <em>F<sub>hkl</sub></em> is calculated over all atoms in the unit
cell.

<h3>
<a name="ScatteringGeometry">
Scattering Geometry: Conditions for Diffraction
</a>
</h3>

<h4>
<a name="BraggsEquation">
Bragg's Equation
</a>
</h4>

<p>
X-ray diffraction by a single crystal can be cast in terms of reflections from
regular, parallel arrays of planes within a crystal. Only under special
conditions would the reflected radiation interfere constructively and a
diffracted beam be observed. The required condition is that the angle of
incidence <em>theta</em> of the incident beam obey the following relationship:

<p align=center><img src="diffract/bragg.gif">

<!-- LATEX diffract/bragg \[
    \sin \theta = n \, \frac{\lambda}{2} \, \frac{1}{d}
\] ENDLATEX -->

<p>
where

  <ul>
  <p><li><em>lambda</em> is the wavelength of incident radiation
  <li> <em>d</em> is the inter-planar spacing
  <li><em>n</em> is an integer called the <em>order of diffraction</em>.
  </ul>

<p>
This relationship is known as <em>Bragg's equation</em>, and
<em>theta</em> is known as the <em>Bragg angle</em>.  Since the angle of
reflection off a plane surface is equal to the angle of incidence, the
Bragg angle also defines the scattering angle:  the angle between the
incident and scattered radiation is 2*<em>theta</em>.

<h4>
<a name="LaueEquations">
Laue Equations
</a>
</h4>

<p>
Another way to look at crystal diffraction is in terms of point
scatterers.  The scattering vector <b>s</b> can be written as the vector
difference between unit vectors lying along the directions of the incident
and scattered (reflected) vectors, scaled by:

1/<em>lambda</em>:

<p align=center><img src="diffract/laue1.gif">

<!-- LATEX diffract/laue1 \[
    \mathbf{s} = \frac{ \mathbf{S}_S' - \mathbf{S}_0' }{\lambda}
\] ENDLATEX -->

<p>
The magnitude of <b>s</b> is then:

<p align=center><img src="diffract/laue2.gif">

<!-- LATEX diffract/laue2 \[
    | \mathbf{s} | = \frac{2 \sin \theta}{\lambda}
\] ENDLATEX -->


<p>
where <em>lambda</em> is the wavelength of both the incident and scattered
radiation.

<p>
For a row of scatterers, spaced at vector distances <b>a</b>,
constructive interference between the scattered rays will occur only where:

<center><blockquote>
    <b>a</b> &middot; <b>s</b> = <em>h</em>
</center></blockquote>

<p>
<em>h</em> is the difference, in wavelengths, between the paths of waves
scattered by neighboring scatterers.  <em>h</em> will always be an integer.

No significant
intensity will be observed except when this condition is satisfied.

<p>
Extensions to two and three dimensions follow readily.  To each diffracted
beam, a pair or triple of integers <em>hk</em> or <em>hkl</em> can be
assigned. In three dimensions, the conditions for observed diffraction
are:

<center><blockquote>
<b>a</b> &middot; <b>s</b> = <em>h</em> <br>
<b>b</b> &middot; <b>s</b> = <em>k</em> <br>
<b>c</b> &middot; <b>s</b> = <em>l</em>
</center></blockquote>

<p>
These conditions are known as the Laue equations.

<h3><a name="ReciprocalLattice">The Reciprocal Lattice</a></h3>

<p>
Since the Bragg approach and the Laue approach both describe the same
phenomenon, there should be an exact relation between the two.  The
connection is that the <em>hkl</em> indices specify the Bragg reflecting
planes for a given order of diffraction.  These indices resemble
<em>Miller indices</em> -- integers used to represent directions in a
crystal with reference to the crystallographic axes -- except that Miller
indices do not have common factors.  Indices of reflection have the common
factor <em>n</em>, the order of diffraction.

<p>
Representing diffraction reflections by indices suggests that diffraction
patterns can be expressed in terms of a lattice whose coordinates are
<em>h</em>, <em>k</em>, and <em>l</em>.  It turns out that this lattice
can be constructed by applying simple reciprocal transformations to the
vectors <b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, and <b>c</b> describing the direct crystal
lattice.  The new lattice is called the <em>reciprocal lattice</em>. Its
points represent all the possible reflecting conditions, each of which can
be associated with a structure factor.

<p>
The reciprocal lattice is specified by reciprocal lattice vectors
<b>a*</b>, <b>b*</b>, and <b>c*</b>, defined in the following way:

<center><blockquote>
  <table border="1" cellpadding="4">
  <tr>
    <td><b>a &middot; a</b><sup>*</sup>=1</td>
    <td><b>a &middot; b</b><sup>*</sup>=0</td>
    <td><b>a &middot; c</b><sup>*</sup>=0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>b &middot; a</b><sup>*</sup>=0</td>
    <td><b>b &middot; b</b><sup>*</sup>=1</td>
    <td><b>b &middot; c</b><sup>*</sup>=0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>c &middot; a</b><sup>*</sup>=0</td>
    <td><b>c &middot; b</b><sup>*</sup>=0</td>
    <td><b>c &middot; c</b><sup>*</sup>=1</td>
  </tr>
  </table>
</center></blockquote>

<p>
The scattering vector <b>s</b> can be conveniently expressed in terms of
the reciprocal lattice vectors as:

<center><blockquote>
<b>s</b> = <em>h</em><b>a*</b> + <em>k</em><b>b*</b> + <em>l</em><b>c*</b>
</center></blockquote>

<p>
which clearly satisfies the Laue equations.  If we introduce
<b>d</b><sub><em>hkl</em></sub>, the distance vector between reflection
planes, into the Laue equations, we obtain:

<center><blockquote>
<b>s</b> = <b>d</b><sub><em>hkl</em></sub> /
    <em>d<sub>hkl</sub></em><sup>2</sup>
</center></blockquote>

<p>
The magnitude of <b>s</b> is:

<center><blockquote>
|<b>s</b>| = 1 / <em>d<sub>hkl</sub></em>
</center></blockquote>

<p>
In other words, the magnitude of the scattering vector is the inverse
of the direct lattice inter-planar spacing.  Putting this back into
Bragg's equation, we obtain the following simple relationship that
provides an easy test for determining whether a reciprocal lattice point
is a potential source of diffraction:

<p align=center><img src="diffract/reciprocal.gif">

<!-- LATEX diffract/reciprocal \[
    | \mathbf{s} | = \frac{2 \sin \theta}{\lambda} \leq \frac{2}{\lambda}
\] ENDLATEX -->



<p>
The inequality merely expresses the fact that the magnitude of
sin(<em>theta</em>) must be less than or equal to 1.

<h3><a name="GeneralCorrectionFactors">General Correction Factors</a></h3>

<p>
Diffraction intensity of a particular reflection is calculated from the
square of the associated structure factor.  To be able to make a
meaningful comparison to experimentally observed values, terms must be
included to account for various physical aspects of diffraction.

<h4> <a name="TemperatureFactors"> Temperature Factors </a> </h4>

<p>
Atoms are not stationary. They possess thermal energy and are in constant
oscillation. The resultant effect is that atom scattering factors fall off
faster with diffraction angle than in the stationary model since the atom
electron clouds are effectively spread over a larger volume of space.

<p>
To correct for thermal motion, the following temperature factor correction
is applied to each scattering factor:


<p align=center><img src="diffract/temperature1.gif">

<!-- LATEX diffract/temperature1 \[
    e ^ { \textstyle - B\; \sin^2 \theta / \lambda^2 }
\] ENDLATEX -->




<p>
If atom oscillation is assumed to be isotropic (the same in all directions),
<em>B</em>, the <em>Debye-Waller factor</em>, is proportional
to the isotropic mean-square amplitude of atom vibration:

<p align=center><img src="diffract/temperature2.gif">

<!-- LATEX diffract/temperature2 \[
    B = 8 \pi^2 \left< u^2 \right>
\] ENDLATEX -->

<p>
where <em>u</em> is the amplitude of vibration (more specifically, it is
the projection of the atom position vector onto the scattering vector
<b>s</b>).
Angle brackets denote a quantum statistical mechanical average.

<p>
If global anisotropic temperature factors are used, the mean-squared
amplitudes of oscillation are required in three directions; for
convenience, the directions can be expressed with reference to the direct
lattice axes <b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, and <b>c</b>.

The term "global",
when referring to temperature factors, implies that the temperature
factors apply to all atoms, regardless of element.

<p>
More precise temperature factor correction requires atom temperature
factors --- temperature factors which depend on atom element.

<h4>
<a name="LorentzGeometricCorrection"> Lorentz Geometric Correction </a>
</h4>

<p>
Diffraction data collection usually involves a crystal rotating through a
stationary beam of incident radiation.  When a crystal is rotated,
different planes of the crystal present themselves in their reflecting
orientations at different rates, with result that reflections with small
Bragg angles and with large Bragg angles are enhanced.  The <em>Lorentz
factor</em> is used to correct intensity values for this effect:

<p align=center><img src="diffract/lorentz1.gif">

<!-- LATEX diffract/lorentz1 \[
    L = \frac{1}{\sin 2\theta}
\] ENDLATEX -->

<p>
In the case of fiber samples, a modified correction factor has been
proposed by de Wolff [de Wolff, 1962] to account for fiber texture:

  <ul>
  <p><li>Equatorial reflections (i.e. radial):

<p align=center><img src="diffract/lorentz2.gif">

<!-- LATEX diffract/lorentz2 \[
    L = 8 \pi \, sin^2\theta \, \cos\theta
\] ENDLATEX -->


  <li>Diatropic reflections (i.e. axial):

<p align=center><img src="diffract/lorentz3.gif">

<!-- LATEX diffract/lorentz3 \[
    L = 8 \pi t \, sin^2\theta \, \cos\theta
\] ENDLATEX -->


<p>
where <em>t</em> is given by:

<p align=center><img src="diffract/lorentz4.gif">

<!-- LATEX diffract/lorentz4 \[
    t = 0.815 \; \omega
\] ENDLATEX -->



<p>
Here, <em>omega</em> is the azimuthal angle for
which the intensity falls to half the maximum peak value, assuming
a Gaussian azimuthal distribution.

  <p><li>General nondiatropic reflections:

<p align=center><img src="diffract/lorentz5.gif">

<!-- LATEX diffract/lorentz5 \[
    L = 8 \pi \, sin^2\theta \, \cos\theta \, \cos\phi
\] ENDLATEX -->

<p>
where <em>phi</em> is the angle between the normal to the
reflecting plane (i.e. the scattering vector) and the fiber axis
(assumed to be along the <b>c</b>-axis).

  </ul>

<h3> <a name="XrayCorrectionFactors">X-ray Correction Factors </a> </h3>

<h4>
<a name="PolarizationCorrection">
Polarization Correction
</a>
</h4>

<p> The efficiency of X-ray reflection varies with the angle of
reflection.  When unpolarized X-ray radiation strikes a reflecting plane,
the component parallel to the plane is fully reflected while that
perpendicular to the plane is reduced in amplitude by the cosine of the
reflection angle.  To correct for this effect, the following polarization
factor for unpolarized radiation can be used:

<p align=center><img src="diffract/polarization1.gif">

<!-- LATEX diffract/polarization1 \[
    p = \frac{1 + \cos^2 2\theta}{\!2\,}
\] ENDLATEX -->

<p>
This term is independent of the method of data collection except if a
crystal monochromator is used.  When using a crystal monochromator, the
resultant X-ray beam is partly polarized.  For partly polarized radiation,
the polarization correction factor can be expressed as:

<p align=center><img src="diffract/polarization2.gif">

<!-- LATEX diffract/polarization2 \[
    p = \frac{P+K\,\cos^2 2\theta}{P+K}
\] ENDLATEX -->

<p>
where

  <ul>
  <p><li><em>K</em> is the ratio of the power of the perpendicular to
the parallel components in the monochromatized beam, and can be
approximated as:

<p align=center><img src="diffract/polarization3.gif">

<!-- LATEX diffract/polarization3 \[
    \cos^4 2\theta_m
\] ENDLATEX -->


<p>
where <em>theta<sub>m</sub></em> is the Bragg angle of the strongly
reflecting planes in the monochromatizing crystal.

  <li><em>P</em> accounts for the degree of polarization of the X-ray
beam, given as the fractional amount of the parallel component in the
beam.

  </ul>

<p>
When using X-ray radiation, the Lorentz factor is commonly combined with
the polarization correction factor.  Together they are referred to as
the <em>Lp</em> correction factor.


<h4><a name="AnomalousScattering">Anomalous Scattering</a></h4>

<p>
The scattering theory behind the diffraction model described in this
chapter (Thomson scattering) assumes that the frequency of incident
radiation differs significantly from that of the natural absorption
frequencies of electrons in the diffracting atoms.  For electrons closest
to the nucleus (K electrons), however, this assumption is generally
violated.  Anomalous phase changes occur on scattering, i.e. the phase
and amplitude of the scattered wave is modified from that expected under
Thomson scattering assumptions.  To account for this, atom scattering
factors are corrected by a complex term that describes the modification.

<center><blockquote>
<em>f</em> = <em>f</em><sub>0</sub> + <em>f</em>' + <em>f</em>''
</center></blockquote>

<p>
The correction terms are effectively independent of scattering angle.

<h3><a name="DataCollection">Data Collection</a></h3>


<h4><a name="SampleTypes">Sample Types</a></h4>

<p>
Some compounds can be made to crystallize into sizeable single crystals,
others can be obtained only as powders.  Some materials have an oriented
texture, such as fibrous materials.

<p>
Diffraction patterns from single crystals are arrays of sharp spots.
Powder samples are composed of many tiny crystallites of all
orientations.  Thus, instead of single diffracted beams being generated
for a given Bragg angle, a family of beams is generated, all lying on a
cone with semi-angle 2*<em>theta</em>; the image obtained is then a series
of concentric circles.  Fiber samples comprise crystallites strongly
oriented in a given direction, and so generate a picture that is somewhere
in between that from single crystals and that from powders.

<p>
Powder crystallites may exhibit a propensity to orient in a particular
direction.   If there is a preferred orientation, correction factors can
be introduced to account for it.  There are several different kinds of
corrections that can be made, two of which described here.

<p>
The <em>March-Dollase</em> preferred-orientation correction characterizes
the strength of the preferred orientation of crystallites using the March
variable <em>R</em>:

<p align=center><img src="diffract/marchdollase.gif">

<!-- LATEX diffract/marchdollase \[
    \left( R^2 \cos^2 \alpha + R^{-1} \sin^2 \alpha
    \right)^{\textstyle -\frac{3}{2}}
\] ENDLATEX -->


<p>
This variable is defined differently for different crystal morphologies.
For platy crystallites, <em>R</em> is defined to be
<em>d/d<sub>0</sub></em>, while for needle-like crystallites it is
defined to be the inverse, <i>d<sub>0</sub>/d</i>. <em>d<sub>0</sub></em>
is the hypothetical thickness of the uncompacted/unextended sample, and
<em>d</em> is the sample thickness after axial compaction or extension.
<em>R</em>=1.0 implies no preferred orientation.

<p>The <em>Rietveld-Toraya</em> method uses a Gaussian expression to model
the effects of preferred orientation:

<!-- LATEX diffract/rietveldtoraya \[

<p>
<em>G</em><sub>1</sub>=0 or <em>G</em><sub>2</sub>=1 implies no
preferred orientation.

<p>
The reciprocal lattice represents a full three-dimensional diffraction
pattern.  When recording a diffraction pattern, however, only a projection
of the data can be captured, and information may be lost.  Peaks in the
diffraction pattern may overlap and become unresolvable.  For powder
samples, the diffraction data is effectively reduced to one-dimension: at
each Bragg angle a peak is observed, the height of which is the sum of the
intensities of all <em>hkl</em> reflections of that angle.  For single
crystal and fiber samples, overlaps can still occur.  Moving-film
techniques have been developed to eliminate spot coincidence in 2-D
diffraction patterns.

<p>
Powder samples are commonly recorded using either a strip of film within a
cylindrical camera setting, or a diffractometer that counts the number of
X-ray photons.

<p>
There are many 2-D diffraction cameras, including flat plate, cylindrical
film, precession, and Weissenberg.  Flat plate and cylindrical film
methods involve a stationary recording medium in either a planar
configuration or a cylinder surrounding the sample configuration.
Precession and Weissenberg imaging techniques are more complicated as they
require a moving photographic film cartridge. They offer, however, a means
for photographing diffraction patterns without overlapped spots. The
Buerger precession method is particularly valuable as it provides an
undistorted projection of the reciprocal lattice. Its chief disadvantage
is that it records less of reciprocal space than does, for instance, the
Weissenberg camera.

<h3><a name="SettingRadiationParameters">Setting Radiation Parameters</a></h3>

<p>Press <b>Radiation</b> to open the Radiation Source panel.

<p><center><img src="diffract/radsrc.png"></center>

<p>There are 3 types of radiation to choose from: X-ray, Electron, or Neutron.

  <ul>
  <p><li><b>X-ray radiation</b>

    <ul>
    <p><li>Choose the X-ray source. The wavelength (in angstroms)
associated with each of the Cu, Cr, Fe, Mo, and Ag anodes is calculated
from their K-alpha emission wavelengths using the approximation that the
alpha line is composed of alpha1 and alpha2 components in the ratio of
2:1.  If Synchrotron is chosen, you may specify the wavelength.

    <p><li>Specify whether to include the polarization correction factor.
If the X-rays are polarized (e.g. Synchrotron source), set the
polarization fraction accordingly.  A polarization fraction of 0.5 indicates
that the radiation is unpolarized.  The value must be in the range
[0..1].

    <p><li>Specify whether to include anomalous scattering corrections.

    <p><li>If using Synchrotron radiation, specify whether a crystal
monochromator is being used.  The sine of the diffraction angle of a
single or double crystal monochromator is related to the incident
radiation wavelength by a constant.  Specifying the diffraction angle
results in the wavelength being recalculated, and vice-versa.  A new
monochromator constant can be set by selecting New and then specifying
either the monochromator angle or radiation wavelength or both.  To
recover the default monochromator constant, press <b>Default</b>.
    </ul>

  <p><li><b>Electron radiation</b>
     <ul>
     <p><li>Specify either the wavelength in angstroms or the energy
    of the incident beam.  To specify energy, turn on Specify Electron
    Radiation Energy (in kV) and enter a value at the text field.  The
    energy value must be in the range [0.00005..54.8474] kV.
    </ul>

  <p><li><b>Neutron radiation</b>
    <ul>
    <p><li>Enter the wavelength in angstroms.
    </ul>

  </ul>

<p>Press <b>Set</b> to apply the radiation parameter settings.
The Current Parameters
report area in the Crystal Diffraction Simulation panel will be
automatically updated.

<h3><a name="SettingGeneralCorrections">Setting General Corrections</a></h3>

Press <b>Corrections</b> to open the General Corrections panel.

  <ul>
  <p><li>Choose whether to include the Lorentz geometric
correction factor.

  <p><li>Choose whether to include Temperature Factor correction.
For Global isotropic temperature factors, specify either <i>B</i>, the
Debye-Waller factor, or <i>u</i>, the mean amplitude of vibration of the
atom.  <i>B</i> and <i>u</i> are directly related, and both are measured
in square angstroms.  For Global anisotropic temperature factor
correction, specify the mean amplitude of vibration in each of the
<b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, and <b>c</b> directions.

  <p>
  If the molecule loaded in the system has atom temperature factors set
(this will be the case, for instance, if you loaded a PDB file containing
temperature factor data), you can elect to use Atom isotropic temperature
factor corrections.
