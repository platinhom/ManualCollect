<!-- ============================== OVERVIEW ============================= -->

<p><a name="Overview"></a><h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The Ligand Interactions application provides a means to visualize an active
site of a complex in diagrammatic form. The content is presented in a concise
and stylized manner, and summarizes a large amount of spatial data making use of
mnemonic glyphs where appropriate. The panel can be used as a complement to 3D
visualization, as the 2D and 3D representations can be displayed alongside one
another. The content can also be exported in graphical or tabular form, as well
as printed.

<p>The diagram itself consists of the selected ligand as the centerpiece, which
is drawn using the traditional schematic style for molecules. A selection of
interacting entities, which includes hydrogen-bonded residues, close but
non-bonded residues, solvent molecules and ions are drawn about the ligand,
their positions in 2D being chosen to be representative of the observed 3D
distances, as well as taking into account aesthetic considerations. Additional
properties such as solvent accessible surface area and the ligand proximity
outline are also shown.

<p>The user interface provides control over whether certain elements are drawn,
and to some extent their color and style. The definition of hydrogen bonded,
ionic and proximity interactions can be affected by modifying cutoff values. The
interactions which are shown in the 2D diagram in the panel are reflected also
in the MOE main window.

<!-- ============================ METHODOLOGY ============================ -->

<p><a name="Method"></a><h2>Methodology</h2>

<p>The information content displayed in the Ligand Interactions panel is similar
to that presented by the popular program <tt>LIGPLOT</tt> [Wallace 1995], except
with a stronger emphasis on aesthetics. A full treatment of the method is
described in the literature [Clark 2007].

<p>Generation of the protein-ligand annotation diagram consists of the
following steps:

<blockquote><ol>

<p><li>Ascertain the interactions between the ligand and the species immediately
surrounding it, and decide which residues, solvents and ions are to be included
in the diagram.

<p><li>Layout the coordinates of the ligand, taking into consideration the
extent to which the flattened version is comparable to the 3D conformation.

<p><li>Position the residues with strong hydrogen bonds to the ligand, arranging
them in the plane and reproducing the 3D distances in 2D as best as possible.

<p><li>Position the residues which are proximal to the ligand but do not have
strong contacts, preserving 3D distances to the extent possible.

<p><li>Calculate the proximity contour and solvent accessibility.

<p><li>Draw each of the entities.

</ol></blockquote>

<p><a name="MethodInteract"></a><h3>Calculate Interactions</h3>

<p>The atoms which constitute the ligand must first be decided upon. By default,
this is the set of atoms which would be selected using <nobr><b>MOE | Selection
| Ligand</b></nobr>, further reduced by including only the largest continuously
connected component. Other definitions of the ligand may be used, but the set
must indicate a continuously connected molecular species.

<p><b>Hydrogen Bonds</b>: Each pair of heavy atoms from the ligand set and the
receptor set could be a hydrogen bond if: (1) there is a tautomer combination in
which one of the atoms is a potential H-bond donor and the other is a potential
H-bond acceptor, and (2) the distance and orientation are favorable for the
particular functional group.  For each viable ligand:receptor atom pair an
interaction energy is calculated, and it is possible to set the minimum bound
for what is considered to be hydrogen bond.  The directionality of the hydrogen 
bond is also noted; it is possible for a ligand:receptor pair to be 
potentially both a donor <i>and</i> an acceptor.

<p><b>Solvent Interactions</b>: Ligand atoms can form hydrogen bonds with
solvent molecules, typically water. The perception and scoring is done in the
same way as for ligand:receptor pairs, except that solvent hydrogen bonds are
only retained if the solvent molecule has a qualifying hydrogen bond to the
ligand.  If the solvent molecule has additionally a hydrogen bond to the
receptor it is drawn as well.  Un-anchored solvent molecules are considered to
be fluxional and transient, and do not appear in the diagram.

<p><b>Metal Ligation</b>: Metal atoms which are bonded to the ligand, or are
close enough to be within bonded distance, are classified as ligand:metal
ligation interactions.  As with hydrogen bonds, energies for the metal
ligation interactions are calculated, which may be used as a minimum bound
for inclusion.

<p><b>Nonbonded Residues</b>: Residues which approach closely to the ligand but
do not have any qualifying strong interactions (i.e. hydrogen bonds) may be
classified as non-bonded residues that have a significant effect on the
orientation and binding of the ligand, but which may be spread out over a number
of pairwise contacts, each of which is relatively weak. Classification of
nonbonded residues is done by the following simple formula: 

<p><div align="center">
<i>cutoff</i> = parameter (default 4.5 &Aring;)<br>
<i>num</i> = number of heavy atoms in the residue closer than <i>cutoff</i><br>
<i>limit</i> = <i>cutoff</i> - 0.9 + 0.1 * <i>num</i>
</div>

<p>The residue must have at least one atom which approaches the ligand at a
distance less than <i>limit</i> to qualify as having a nonbonded interaction. In
this way, residues with few atoms which are particularly close, or many atoms
which are quite close, are selected for inclusion in the diagram. They are not
however assigned any kind of score, and are arranged much less rigorously than
those with a specific strong interaction.

<p><a name="MethodFlatten"></a><h3>Flattening Depiction</h3>

<p>The focal point of the 2D diagram produced by the Ligand Interactions tool is
the ligand itself, which is arranged prior to placement of the residues with
which it interacts. In order to produce an aesthetic layout, the MOE depiction
layout algorithm is invoked [Clark 2006]. If called without modification,
however, the standard depiction method would produce a 2D layout that maximizes
dispersion between non-bonded atoms, within its set of constraints. This is not
always an ideal starting point, since there is often a viable solution which
does not maximize dispersion, but more closely reflects the original 3D
conformation.

<p>In order to encourage a 2D layout solution which suits the needs of the
Ligand Interactions diagram, the layout engine is provided with a callback
function which offsets the scores of each proposed layout with its own criteria.
The modifications are crafted so that they are of sufficient magnitude to
overwhelm the depiction layout algorithm's inverse-distance-squared repulsions
between nonbonded atoms, but not large enough to force the depictor prematurely
into its damage-control methods.

<p>The score for each proposed depiction layout is modified like so:

<p><div align="center"><nobr>
score = score
    + &Sigma;<sub>torsion</sub> w |&theta;<sub>3D</sub> - &theta;<sub>2D</sub>|
    + &Sigma;<sub>i,j</sub> w |dist3D<sub>ij</sub> - dist2D<sub>ij</sub>|
</nobr></div>

<p>The list of torsion quadruplets, and the original 3D angles, are determined
before the process begins. In each case the 2D layout is penalized according to
its relative deviation from the proper conformation, which rewards choices that
resemble the original geometry.

<p>Similarly, the distance matrix of heavy atom pairs [i,j] where i &lt; j is
formed, and scaled such that the average bond length in 3D is the same as the 2D
depiction ideal. The 2D layout is penalized less if the distances are similar to
the 3D conformation. The weighting for this term is set to the inverse square
of the 3D distance, in order to prevent long range terms from overly
dominating the score. For pairs where one of the atoms has a strong contact to a
residue, the weighting is 10-times heavier, and those for which both atoms have
a strong contact are magnified 100-fold.

<div align="center"><table border=0>

<tr><td colspan="2" align="center">
<img src="prolig2d/flat1.png">
<p>3D conformation of ligand
</tr>
<tr><td align="center" valign="bottom"><img src="prolig2d/flat2.png">
<p>Normal depiction
<td align="center" valign="bottom"><img src="prolig2d/flat3.png">
<p>Flattening depiction
</tr>

</table></div>

<p>It is important to note that the resulting depiction is not at all guaranteed
to resemble the 3D conformation, but rather it is encouraged to do so, as long
as primary aesthetic constraints can still be satisfied. Highly non-planar
molecules (e.g. the orthogonal conformations of biphenyl derivatives) require
compromise. The techniques which are described subsequently <i>desire</i> but do
not <i>require</i> faithful correspondence with the 2D ligand coordinates and
the proper original conformation.

<p><a name="MethodPos1"></a><h3>Position Ligated Metals</h3>

<p>Metals which are classified as being ligated to the ligand are temporarily
promoted to being a part of the ligand, immediately prior to the layout
described above, then subsequently disconnected. This results in the position of
the metal being obtained from the depiction layout.

<p><a name="MethodPos2"></a><h3>Position Hydrogen-bonded Residues</h3>

<p>Residues and solvent molecules which are bound to the ligand by a hydrogen
bond are placed next. There are many competing effects which determine where a
strongly interacting residue is positioned. Since a line will be drawn on the
final diagram for each such interaction, it is very important to try to find a
position in which the 2D distances of these interactions proportionally reflects
the 3D distance. But it is also important to provide an impression of the
spatial relationship to other nearby residues, and to  place them in such a way
that they do not obscure other features such as bonds, atoms or other residues.

<p><b>Initial placement</b>: Finding an initial guess position for each residue
is very important, because the main placement criteria are expressed as a
continuous multivariable optimization problem. Any starting point which is in a
far-from-optimal local minimum must be avoided. As a general consideration,
starting points should be far from atoms and bonds, and not inside rings,
nor inside "pincer"-like formations.

<p>In order to ensure that the basic requirements are met, a coarse grid is
placed around the ligand, and the repulsions from specific regions are
overlayed, as is shown in the following diagram:

<p><div align="center"><table border=0>
<tr>
<td><img src="prolig2d/grid1.png" border=1>
<td><img src="prolig2d/grid2.png" border=1>
<tr>
<td align="center">1. Base avoidance
<td align="center">2. Specific attraction
</table></div>

<p>The base repulsive grid (1) is formed by adding Gaussian distributions at
atom and ring centers, which ensure that the minimum point will be well outside
of the molecular region. The grid in (2) shows the placement guide for a residue
that has a single strong contact to the nitrogen atom which is highlighted with
a circle. The overlay function is <nobr>[1 - d / max d]</nobr>, where d =
distance between grid point and contacting atom. The grid point with the lowest
value is shown by the X mark, and serves as the starting position for the
residue.

<p><b>Multivariable Refinement</b>: Each residue atom which has a strong contact
to the ligand is placed in the method described above. Then, each of the (x,y)
coordinates is defined as a variable, and they are collectively refined by
minimization of the following continuously differentiable energy function:

<div align="center"><table border=0>

<tr><td>energy
<td>= &Sigma;<sub>ij</sub> w<sub>ij</sub> (dist<sup>2</sup><sub>ij</sub> -
D<sup>2</sup>)<sup>2</sup>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<i>(variable-variable desired distances)</i>

<tr><td><td>+ &Sigma;<sub>ij</sub> w<sub>ij</sub> 
exp [-K dist<sup>2</sup><sub>ij</sub>]
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<i>(variable-variable short range repulsion)</i>

<tr><td><td>+ &Sigma;<sub>ik</sub> w<sub>ik</sub> 
(dist<sup>2</sup><sub>ik</sub> - D<sup>2</sup>)<sup>2</sup>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<i>(variable-fixed point desired distances)</i>

<tr><td><td>+ &Sigma;<sub>ik</sub> w<sub>ik</sub> 
exp [-K dist<sup>2</sup><sub>ik</sub>]
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<i>(variable-fixed point short range repulsion)</i>

<tr><td><td>+ &Sigma;<sub>&theta;</sub> w<sub>&theta;</sub>
exp [-&frac12;K (1 - cos &theta;)<sup>2</sup>]
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<i>(variable-fixed point angular repulsion)</i>

</table></div>

<p>The variable-variable terms are primarily based on the desired distance,
which is that of the 3D environment of the receptor, which should be matched in
2D when possible. Since the term is distance to the power of 4, the weighting is
scaled down by the 3D distance, in order to ensure that nearby residues
influence each other more significantly. Short-range repulsion between variable
terms are expressed as a Gaussian type function, which is scaled such that it
dominates in the region of <1 &Aring;, but fades quickly with greater distance.

<p>Variable-fixed point desired distances are composed of the strong
interactions to the ligand atoms. All ligand:receptor atom pairs which are not
connected by a strong interaction are accumulated in the variable-fixed point
repulsion terms.

<p>Variable-fixed point angular repulsion terms appear when more than one
receptor atom is connected to a single ligand atom, in which case the angle
formed between each instance of <nobr>&theta =
var<sub>i</sub>-fixed-var<sub>j</sub></nobr> is highly repulsive when &theta; is
small.

<p><b>Consolidation</b>: The atoms belonging to particular residues are
collapsed into one point per residue by averaging positions. The energy function
is updated accordingly with the interactions and distances merged, and the
new variables are resubmitted to the energy minimization, to obtain final
positions for the strongly-bound residues.

<p><a name="MethodPos3"></a><h3>Position Non-bonded Residues</h3>

<p>Nonbonded residues are subjected to the same initial placement algorithm
described above, except that the already-placed residues are also included in
the regions of the surface to avoid. The same energy minimization process is
used, except that the terms are employed differently. The variable-variable
desired distance terms are not used. The variable-fixed point desired distances
are set to be the initial placement positions, with a very light weighting.
Variable-fixed point repulsion terms include ligand atoms, as well as the
positions of residues which have previously been placed, and there is no angular
repulsion term.

<p>The overall effect is that the nonbonded residues are more sensitive to the
initial placement algorithm, which is relative to all of the ligand atoms within
a mild proximity of each residue, but are also more flexible in terms of
deviation therefrom. They tend to be spaced evenly, and take up space beyond or
in between the previously placed entities.

<p><div align="center"><table border=0>

<tr>
<td align="center">3D Active Site
<td align="center">2D Placement
</table></div>

<p>The above images show a portion of the 3D active site of a protein-ligand
complex, including for clarity only the residues and water molecules which are
connected to the ligand by a hydrogen bond.  It can be seen that the 2D
arrangement shows the same orientation.

<p><a name="MethodSurf"></a><h3>Proximity and Surfaces</h3>

<p>While the arrangement of ligands and residues is frequently sufficient to
gain an insight into the proximity of the species in the active site, the
information content can be significantly enhanced by calculating properties
based on the 3D data, then presenting this data in a pictorial summary form.

<p><b>Proximity Contour</b>: It useful to be able to observe how much space is
available to the more outward-facing parts of the ligand, which can be expressed
in its final form as a contour line surrounding the ligand. In areas where the
exterior of the ligand is close to the receptor cavity, the line will be drawn
tightly around the ligand in 2D, and loosely when there is plenty of available
space.

<p>In order to calculate the data for the contour, for each atom some number of
trajectories (possibly zero) are generated. The trajectories are dependent on
the geometry of the atom and the number of substituents. If there are
insufficient anchor points, as is the case for sp<sup>3</sup> and sp<sup>2</sup>
atoms with only one neighbor, a sampling set is created. Otherwise, the
trajectories are indicative of the positions that would typically be occupied by
a hydrogen substituent:

<p><div align="center"><table border=0>
<tr>
<td align="center" valign="middle"><img src="prolig2d/cannon1.png">
<td align="center" valign="middle"><img src="prolig2d/cannon2.png">
<td align="center" valign="middle"><img src="prolig2d/cannon3.png">
<tr>
<td align="center" valign="middle">sp<sup>3</sup>/3
<td align="center" valign="middle">sp<sup>3</sup>/2
<td align="center" valign="middle">sp<sup>3</sup>/1
<tr>
<td align="center" valign="middle"><img src="prolig2d/cannon4.png">
<td align="center" valign="middle"><img src="prolig2d/cannon5.png">
<td align="center" valign="middle"><img src="prolig2d/cannon6.png">
<tr>
<td align="center" valign="middle">sp<sup>2</sup>/2
<td align="center" valign="middle">sp<sup>2</sup>/1
<td align="center" valign="middle">sp/1
</table></div>

<p>For each of the trajectories, a "cannonball" of radius 0.8 &Aring; is fired
along the line. Every other atom in the system, except the origin, is considered
to be a ball of van der Waals size. The extent is the distance which the
cannonball travels before intersecting with another atom, bounded below by zero
and above by 1.5 &Aring;. If multiple trajectories are assigned to the atom, the
average is used.

<p>The contour that is plotted from the resulting extents is useful as a measure
of substitution space. For example, if by examining the diagram it appears that
there is room for a methyl group, this is likely to be the case in the actual
active site:

<p><div align="center"><img src="prolig2d/contour.png">
<br>Proximity contour: 1RO6 Hydrolase</div>

<p>In the above complex, it can clearly be seen that there is a
significant amount of space available for direct substitution on any of the
three ring systems, especially the terminal cyclopentyl group, but that the
heteroatoms and one side of the aromatic ring are more congested.

<p><b>Solvent Accessibility</b>: Two types of solvent accessibility metrics are
available: ligand solvent accessibility, and residue solvent accessibility. Both
of these quantities are based on measuring exposed surface area once each of the
atoms has been assigned a van der Waals-like radius + 1.4 &Aring;, the latter
part assuming that the solvent is water. Qualitatively, this means that if an
atom's assigned sphere is completely subsumed by the spheres of other atoms in
the ensemble, its exposure is 0. If an atom exists alone in space with no
overlap, its exposure is 4&pi;r<sup>2</sup>. Deeply buried atoms tend to have
almost zero exposed surface area, whereas for instance a terminal substituent on
a ligand which is sticking out of the active site may have an exposed surface
area on the order of half the maximum possible value.

<p>For solvent accessibility of ligands, the surface accessibility calculation
is carried out on the ligand + receptor complex, i.e. the receptor residues will
also cover up the surfaces of the ligand atoms, if they are close enough. In the
following example, the oligopeptide ligand is oriented "through" the active
site, like an embedded arrow: 

<p><div align="center"><img src="prolig2d/ligsurf.png">
<br>Ligand solvent accessibility: 1AAQ Hydrolase</div>

<p>The part of the ligand which is shown on the right hand side of the diagram
projects significantly far from the active site, and two of the terminal methyl
groups are very highly exposed to solvent. The opposite end of the ligand, shown
on the left hand side, is also exposed, but to a lesser extent.

<p>Solvent exposure of receptor residues is calculated by examining the
difference between the solvent-exposed surface area of the receptor with and
without the presence of the ligand. The differences are summed for the heavy
atoms belonging to each residue. If the value is zero, then the residue exposure
to solvent is not affected at all by the ligand. A high value probably
means that a number of residue atoms are "covered up" by the ligand, which is
often indicative of hydrophobic interactions which are collectively important. A
small value likely means that just one or two of the residue atoms are
moderately affected by the presence of the ligand.

<p>In the following example:

<p><div align="center"><img src="prolig2d/recsurf.png">
<br>Receptor solvent accessibility: 1AAQ Hydrolase</div>

<p>The receptor exposure differences are shown by the size and intensity of
the turquoise discs surrounding the residues. The Arg<i>A</i>8 and Gly<i>B</i>48
residues (on the right hand side) express a side-chain and backbone segment,
respectively, which are both very highly exposed to solvent in the active site
when the ligand is absent. The presence of the ligand greatly reduces the
solvent accessible surface area.

<p><a name="MethodDraw"></a><h3>Drawing</h3>

<p>The Ligand Interactions panel calculates the desired properties using the
contents of the MOE molecular system for input, modified by user-specified
parameters. This data is then used to prepare a 2D <a 
href="../svl/fcnref/grfcn.htm">graphics object</a>, in conjunction with
user-specified aesthetic preferences. The graphics object is used to display the
contents in the panel, and also for printing and exporting.

<p><a name="MethodConcur"></a><h3>Concurrent Layout</h3>

<p>Ligand Interactions operates differently when the input is specified as a
series of bound complexes, rather than a single instance in isolation. Depending
on the combination of options selected, the following additional circumstances
apply:

<ol>

<li><p>The flattened ligands are co-aligned on a common manifold, so their
relative orientations are preserved;

<li><p>The residues are placed simultaneously around all of the ligands, so a
single layout is found which suits all of the complexes;

<li><p>The diagrams are labeled with additional annotations depending on the
extent to which various properties are conserved.

</ol>

<p>The following example shows a single protein, to which two docked poses of a
single ligand have been selected:

<p><div align="center">
<img src="prolig2d/concur1.png" border=1><p>
<img src="prolig2d/concur2.png" border=1></div>

<p>The two poses are oriented in an opposite way, and this observation is
reflected in the 2D diagram. The residue positions are identical in both cases.
In the first diagram there is a hydrogen bond to residue B35, which is annotated
with a bar behind the directional arrow to show that the interaction is not
conserved throughout the series. In the second diagram, the hydrogen bond does
not exist, so the interaction is shown as "dangling". 

<!-- ============================ APPLICATION ============================ -->


<p><a name="Run"></a><h2>Running the Application</h2>

<p>To use the Ligand Interactions panel, load a ligand-receptor
complex into MOE and then select
<span class="nobr"><b>MOE | Compute | Ligand Interactions</b></span> or
<span class="nobr"><b>MOE | RHS | Ligand | Ligand Interactions</b></span>.
The panel will open, displaying a 2D depiction of the
ligand and its interactions with proximal residues of the protein.
If the contents of the molecular system change while the panel
is up, press <b>Apply</b> to recalculate the interaction data
and update the depiction.

By default, the set of atoms with which the ligand may potentially interact
is the union of the atoms which would be selected by <nobr><b>MOE | Selection |

is filled, and any further annotation. By default, all types of residues are set
to Auto.

<p align="center"><img src="prolig2d/option4.png">

<p>The residues occurring in the diagram are one of four types, respectively:
<b>Residue</b> refers to residues with hydrogen bonds to the ligand.
<b>Metal</b> refers to metals which are close enough to be included in the
diagram, though not actually bonded (very tightly bound metals are treated
specially, and drawn as part of the ligand). <b>Solvent</b> refers to solvent
molecules, usually water, hydrogen bonded to the ligand. <b>Nonbonded</b> refers
to receptor residues which are close to but do not have a hydrogen bond to the
ligand.

<p>The possible coloring schemes for each of the residue types are Auto, User,
Residue, Chain and None. The meaning of Auto depends on the residue type. For
receptor residues, whether they are bonded or not, the main color is light green
if the residue is "greasy" (i.e. does not have a polar or charged sidechain), or
light mauve otherwise. Furthermore if the side chain is basic, the residue is
annotated with a blue ring; if it is acidic, it receives a red ring. Solvent
residues of type Auto are drawn with no interior fill, and metal residues are
colored gray.

<p>Types User, Residue, Chain and None are interpreted in the same way
regardless of the residue type. When User is selected, a Color-chooser widget
appears, allowing the specific color to be selected. Residue and Chain cause the
residue to be colored according to the corresponding color of the MOE object.
Note that the default color for residues is black, which is translated into
transparent in this case. Selecting None makes the residue transparent, i.e. it
is drawn with only a border and text.

<p><b>Diagram Options</b>: Additional annotations in the 2D diagram can be
enabled or disabled. 

<p align="center"><img src="prolig2d/option5.png">

<ul>

<li><b>Proximity Contour</b> refers to the dotted outline that surrounds the
ligand, denoting distance to the active site interior. 

<li><b>Ligand Solvent Exposure</b> refers to the blue smudges that are drawn
behind some of the ligand atoms, to denote extent of solvent exposure. 

<li><b>Receptor Solvent Exposure</b> refers to the turquoise discs that are
drawn behind some of the residues, to denote the difference in solvent exposure
due to the presence of the ligand. 

<li><b>Inter-residue Contacts</b> allows hydrogen bonds and non-peptidic
covalent bonds between receptor residues to be annotated. 

<li><b>Bound Solvent Contacts</b> causes residues which interact with non-labile
solvent molecules to be included in the diagram if they were otherwise
insufficiently proximal.

<li><b>Arene System Contacts</b> causes &pi;-&pi;, &pi;-H and &pi;-cation
interactions to be annotated.  
<li><b>Union of Receptor Residues</b> insists that for a series of complexes,
any residue which qualifies for inclusion in any diagram is included in all
diagrams. 

<li><b>Fixed Receptor Positions</b> causes concurrent receptor optimization for
a series; if not on, then the ligands will be co-aligned, but the receptors will
arrange themselves separately for each diagram. 

<li><b>Conserved Features</b> causes additional annotations to be added to a
series to show any interactions which are only observed in some cases, as well
as for residues which do not have the same amino acid type throughout the
series.

<li><b>Site Wall Clash</b> enables checking for ligand atoms which approach
receptor atoms too closely. Cases where such heavy atoms are closer than 1.2
&Aring; less than the sum of the van der Waals distances are marked as clashing
atoms. If clashing atoms disconnect the ligand into multiple components, then
all but the largest component is also categorized as clashing. Clashing
atoms are drawn in red, and all interactions with the receptor are invalidated.

</ul>

<p><b>Rendering Options</b>: Several miscellaneous style preferences can be set
within this option:

<p align="center"><img src="prolig2d/option6.png">


<p><b>Rotation</b> allows the diagram to be rotated by the given angle.
If <b>Reflection</b> is checked, then the diagram is reflected across the
X-axis prior to being rotated.
<b>Residue Size</b> allows the amount of space taken up by the cartoonish
residue labels to be modified from the default setting. <b>Single Letter
Residues</b> allows the single letter residue codes to be used instead of the
default 3 letter codes.


<p><b>Parameters</b>: The criteria for the various types of contacts can be
controlled on this page. The <b>H-bond</b>, and <b>Ionic</b> values refer
to the minimum interactions energies (in kcal/mol) required in order to
qualify.  Note that residues which possess a hydrogen bond or
ionic metal bond to the ligand that does not meet the cutoff will most
likely be reclassified as nonbonded residues, and still be represented in the
diagram. Solvent residues which do not qualify for a sufficiently strong
hydrogen bond generally do not feature in the diagram.

<p>The <b>Nonbonded</b> distance refers to the distance which a residue atom
must be within in order to activate the calculation for deciding whether or not
the whole residue meets the criteria, as described <a
href="#MethodPos3">previously</a>.

The Export panel allows the main contents of the 2D Ligand Interactions
diagram to be exported to a picture format:

<p align="center"><img src="prolig2d/export.png">

<p>A format must be selected, which may be one of the supported bitmap formats
(PNG, GIF, JPG, BMP). On Microsoft Windows platforms, the Clipboard option is
available, which will paste a BMP representation onto the clipboard instead of
writing to a file.

<p>The filename should have an extension appropriate for the type. The width and

can be used to scale isotropically, or the width and height can be entered
specifically to achieve anisotropic scaling.

<p>The content can include the <b>Diagram</b> and/or the <b>Legend</b>, which is
controlled by checkboxes.

<p>The background can be either Transparent or White. Note that JPG and BMP
formats do not support transparency, and GIF files do not have a transparency
alpha channel.

<!-- ============================== EXAMPLES ============================= -->

<a name="Example1"></a>
<div class="example">
<h3>Example 1: Biotin and receptor</h3>

<p>Start by loading the example biotin complex, and setup a surface in order to
view the active site in 3D:

<ol>

<li><p>Clear the molecular data in MOE with <nobr><b>MOE | File |
Close</b></nobr>. 

<li><p>Load biotin with <nobr><b>MOE | File | Open</b></nobr> and select both
<tt>$MOE/sample/mol/biotin.moe</tt> and <tt>$MOE/sample/mol/biotin_rec.moe</tt>
(using ctrl click), and press <b>OK</b>.

<li><p>Open the Surfaces and Maps panel with <nobr><b>MOE | Compute | Surfaces
and Maps</b></nobr>. Without changing any of the default options, click the
<b>Isolate</b> button, followed by <b>Apply</b>. 

<li><p>Open the Graphics Object manager with <nobr><b>MOE | Window | Graphics
Objects</b></nobr>. Select the <tt>Molecular&nbsp;Surface</tt> entry, and adjust
the transparency to suit.

<li><p>Orient and zoom the system so that the groove of the active site is
clearly visible, such as in the image shown below:

<p><div align="center"><img src="prolig2d/ex1a.png"></div>

</ol>

<p>To view the active site in schematic form:

<ol start=6>

<li><p>Open the Ligand Interactions panel with <nobr><b>MOE | Compute | Ligand
Interactions</b></nobr>. The diagram shown in the main panel should resemble the
following:

<p><div align="center"><img src="prolig2d/ex1b.png"></div>

</ol>

<p>The conformational similarity between the 2D and 3D layout of the ligand can
be seen in the images shown above. Further examination of the two renditions
shows that the placements of the H-bonded residues Asn49, Ser45 and Asp128 are
qualitatively preserved. The three residues which are H-bonded to the urea
carbonyl atom (Ser27, Tyr43, Asn23) in a triad cannot be shown in the same
way as per the 3D source, but the selected orientation is a reasonable
compromise.

<p>Some impression of the hydrophobic region around the alkyl chain in the
center of the biotin molecule is given by the proximity of "greasy" residues,
which are colored light green. The polar ends of biotin are more closely
affiliated with polar or ionic residues, both H-bonded and not. The proximity
contour shows that the urea functional group is very closely hemmed-in by the
active site. The remainder of the molecule enjoys relatively spacious
conditions, yet despite there being a significant distance between the boundary
of the active site and the carbon atoms of the alkyl connector segment, this
region has a very low solvent accessible surface area.
</div>

<a name="Example2"></a>
<div class="example">
<h3>Example 2: 1AWH hydrolase</h3>

<ol>

<li><p>Clear the molecule data, and open the file
<tt>$MOE/sample/mol/1awh.pdb</tt>.


<li><p>Add explicit hydrogen atoms with
<nobr><b>MOE | Compute | Protonate 3D</b></nobr>
(Press <b>OK</b> to accept the defaults in the Protonate 3D panel).

<li><p>Open the Sequence Editor with <nobr><b>MOE | Window | Sequence
Editor</b></nobr>, and select all of the atoms in chain #5
(right click on the chain, then go <b>Select | Atoms</b>).

<li><p>Bring up the Ligand Interactions panel with <nobr><b>MOE | Compute |
Ligand Interactions</b></nobr>. Note that the selection defaults to
<tt>Selected&nbsp;Atoms</tt>.

<li><p>The resulting diagram should resemble the following:

<p><div align="center"><img src="prolig2d/ex2a.png"></div>

</ol>

<p>This particular protein has a covalently bound ligand. Because there is some
ambiguity as to the definition of the ligand, it is necessary for the user to
specify which it is. In the diagram shown above, the covalent attachment point
is Ser195. The covalent bond which was detached from the ligand is drawn using
the same line style as for a metal-ligand complex. In the 3D structure, Ser195
has a backbone hydrogen bonding interaction to the connected carbonyl group,
which forms a 6-membered ring.

<p>The covalent ligand has few strong interactions with the remainder of the
protein. A hydroxyl group has a moderately strong bidirectional hydrogen bond to
His57. The steroid end of the ligand (right) projects far out of 
the active site, as is indicated by
the loosening contour, and the high solvent exposure of the terminal atoms.
</div>

<a name="Example3"></a>
<div class="example">
<h3>Example 3: 1ATP Phosphotransferase</h3>

<ol>

<li><p>Clear the molecule data, and open the file
<tt>$MOE/sample/mol/1atp.pdb</tt>.

<li><p>Bring up the Ligand Interactions panel with <nobr><b>MOE | Compute |
Ligand Interactions</b></nobr>. The diagram shown in the main panel should
resemble the following:

<p><div align="center"><img src="prolig2d/ex3a.png"></div>

</ol>

<p>The diagram contains many points, as the ligand is large and ripe with
interactions, including hydrogen bonds to sidechain and backbone residues,
hydrogen bonds to solvent molecules, and two chelated metal ions. The
encapsulating 3D nature of this interaction site cannot be fully captured in the
flattened representation, but a reasonable indication of the conformation, and
an enumeration of all the interactions are clearly presented.

<p>Note that this particular protein is composed of two strands, both of which
have contacts with the ligand. As shown on the diagram, the residue ID numbers
are prefixed by <i>A</i> or <i>B</i> to denote the parent chain. Because the raw
PDB data file was used, there are no hydrogen atoms in the structure, and they
are not used or shown in the diagram.

<div class="example">
<h3>Example 4: Aligned Series</h3>

<p>An aligned series of complexes can be used to view a collection of crystal
structures which have been superposed in 3D, even if they do not have completely
identical residues. The PDB codes 2EUF, 2F2C and 1CKP are shown below (click
on an image to see it in full size):

<a href="prolig2d/ex4c.png">
    <img src="prolig2d/ex4c_small.png">
</a></div>

<p>The first two complexes are CDK2 inhibitors, the last is a CDK6 inhibitor.
The ligands are overlaid in 2D in order to convey their relative binding modes,
and the residues are laid out in the same way for all of the diagrams. Residues
which are not consistently the same amino acid type throughout are marked with
curved sidebars on the interior, whereas those which are invariant are drawn
normally. Non-conserved interactions, in this case all of them, are drawn with a
line behind the arrowhead, while missing interactions are drawn with a line to
an "X".
