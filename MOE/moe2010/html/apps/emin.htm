<p>
The Energy Minimize application in MOE calculates atomic coordinates that are
local minima of a molecular energy function.  Energy minimization is useful
for molecule building, determining low energy conformations, conformational
search and preparation for molecular dynamics simulations and vibrational
analysis.  The supported energy functions are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The current MOE forcefield (e.g. AMBER, CHARMM, MMFF94, etc.)</li>
<li>The MOPAC semi-empirical energy functions (e.g. PM3, AM1, MNDO)</li>
</ul>
<p>
The MOPAC energy functions are fundamentally different from molecular
mechanics forcefields in that they are capable of simulating chemical
reactions.  For information on configuring MOPAC to run in MOE,
please see the section on
<a href="scf.htm#MOPAC">MOPAC Engine</a>.
</p>

<p>In forcefield minimization, the Energy Minimize application is
capable of calculating constrained geometries through the use of MOE's
chiral, distance, angle and dihedral restraints.  In addition, atoms may
be constrained to be frozen during the calculation.
</p>
<h2><a name="Theory">Theory</a></h2>

<p>
Energy minimization consists of finding a set of atomic coordinates
that correspond to a local minimum of the molecular energy function (such
as the potential energy model).  This is done by applying large scale non-linear
optimization techniques to calculate a conformation (near to the starting
geometry) for which the forces on the atoms are zero.
</p>
<p>
<b>Forcefield Optimization</b>.
Non-linear optimization algorithms typically have the following structure
[Gill&nbsp;1981].   Let <i>x<sub>k</sub></i> denote the vector of
atomic coordinates at step <i>k</i> of the procedure and let <i>U</i>
be the energy function.  Then,
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<i>Test for convergence</i>.
If the convergence criteria are satisfied (see below), then
<i>x<sub>k</sub></i> is returned.
</li>
<li>
<i>Compute the search direction</i>.
Compute a non-zero vector <i>p<sub>k</sub></i> called the
<i>search direction</i>.
</li>
<li>
<i>Compute the step size</i>.
Compute a non-zero scalar <i>a</i><sub><i>k</i></sub>, called the
<i>step size</i>, for which 
<span class="nobr"><i>U</i>(<i>x<sub>k</sub></i> + <i>a</i><sub><i>k</i></sub>
<i>p<sub>k</sub></i>) &lt; <i>U</i>(<i>x<sub>k</sub></i>)</span>.
</li>
<li>
<i>Advance</i>.
Set <i>x</i><sub><i>k</i>+1</sub> = <i>x<sub>k</sub></i>
and <i>k</i> = <i>k</i> + 1 and go to Step 1.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
The step size in Step&nbsp;3 is computed by using a safeguarded bicubic
interpolation search along the search direction.  In Step&nbsp;1, the
optimization is terminated when any of the following three conditions
are satisfied:
</p>

<ol>
<li><i>Root Mean Square gradient Test</i>:
|grad <i>U</i>(<i>x</i><sub><i>k</i></sub>)| &lt; <i>e</i><sub><i>A</i></sub>
sqrt(<i>n</i>),
where <i>e</i><sub><i>A</i></sub> is a predefined
constant and <i>n</i> is the number of unfixed atoms.
</li>

<li>
<i>Iteration Limit Test</i>:
<i>k</i> &gt; <i>K</i>, where <i>K</i> is a predefined upper 
limit on the maximum number of iterations.
</li>

<li>
<i>Progress Tests</i>:
The following three conditions are simultaneously satisfied:

<p align=center><img src="emin/tests.png"></p>

<p>In these conditions, <i>T</i> is a predefined constant indicating the
number of significant figures in <i>U</i> that are required (the
<i>function test</i>). For example, if <i>T</i>
 = 10<sup>-6</sup> then six figures of accuracy are required.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
If the iteration limit is exceeded then it is typically due to a failure
of the algorithm.  Note that saddle points satisfy criterion 1; the
conformation should be perturbed slightly and optimization restarted.
If criterion 3 is satisfied then it is very likely that a local minimum
has been achieved.
</p>
<p>
The choice of search direction <i>p<sub>k</sub></i> in Step 2 is what
distinguishes the different nonlinear optimization methods.  MOE uses
a success of three methods to effect an energy minimization: Steepest
Descent (SD), Conjugate Gradient (SG) and Truncated Newton (TN).
In SD optimization
<span class="nobr"><i>p<sub>k</sub></i> = - grad <i>U</i>(<i>x<sub>k</sub></i>)
</span>;
that is, the search proceeds along the direction of the forces.
While intuitive, SD is extremely inefficient after a few iterations and
it is only used when the gradient is extremely high.  When the gradient
is sufficiently small (but still quite high) the CG method is used.
The Conjugate Gradient (CG) method improves upon SD by choosing the
next search direction in a way so as to not undo the progress accomplished
by the previous step. CG performs well in strained conditions; however, it
exhibits poor convergence properties.  Once the gradient is reasonable,
the TN method is used.
</p>
<p>The Truncated Newton (TN) method is the most efficient large-scale
nonlinear optimization method known.  It exhibits superlinear convergence
even in highly nonlinear conditions.  The Truncated Newton method attempts
to use curvature information to improve convergence.  The Newton
direction <i>p</i> satisfies:</p>

<p align=center><img src="emin/newton.png"></p>

<p>where <i>G<sub>k</sub></i> is the second derivative, or Hessian, of
<i>U</i>.   These equations are called the Newton equations.
TN solves the Newton equations approximately using an iterative linear
equation solver. The iterative linear equation solver (based on the Linear
Conjugate Gradient method) is terminated after a small number of
iterations; hence the name Truncated Newton.
</p>
<p>
<b>Quantum Mechanical Optimization</b>.
The PM3, AM1 and MNDO Hamiltonians can be used as the energy model.  These
models are implemented in the external MOPAC program [Stewart&nbsp;1993].
MOPAC is a semi-empirical molecular orbital software program for the study
of chemical structures, including reactions. MOPAC supports the MNDO, MINDO/3,
AM1 and PM3 Hamiltonians (for the electron part of the calculation). For the
most part, MOPAC has been parameterized for the organic elements (and some
transition metals with full d shells). MOPAC can calculate geometries,
transition states, vibrational spectra, thermodynamic quantities and force
constants for molecules, radicals and ions.
MOE will automatically run MOPAC to effect the energy minimization calculation
for these Hamiltonians.  MOPAC uses different optimization methodology
from MOE and a complete description is beyond the scope of this document.

<h2><a name="Run">Running an Energy Minimization</a></h2>

<p>
In general, the following steps should be taken to locate an energy minimum:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Select and configure the forcefield and related parameters with the
<span class="menu">MOE | Footer | <i>forcefield</i></span> button.
Configure the periodic system parameters with
<span class="menu">MOE | Footer | <i>PBC</i></span>,
the periodic boundary conditions button (if the crystal parameters
have been set, the button label will be the current space group).
</li>
<li>
Add Hydrogens and Lone Pair atoms as required using 
the <span class="menu">MOE | Edit | Hydrogens | Add Hydrogens</span> menu
items.  
Alternatively, the Energy Minimize panel can add/remove hydrogen and lone 
pair atoms as required by the current forcefield.
</li>

<li>
Decide which atoms are to be held fixed in space (i.e. frozen during
the minimization calculation).  Fixed atoms can be detected using
<span class="menu">MOE | Selection | Potential | Fixed</span> and modified with
<span class="menu">MOE | Edit | Potential | Fix</span> or
<span class="menu">MOE | Edit | Potential | Unfix</span>.
If a large protein is in a highly strained state, it is a good idea to
fix the backbone or C-alpha atoms.
Alternatively, the Energy Minimize panel also allows temporary (only in effect
during the course of minimization) tethers to be set up for common situations.
</li>

<li>
Decide if restraints are to be added to the system (to constrain geometry).
Use <span class="menu">MOE | Edit | Potential | Restrain</span> to add
distance, angle and dihedral restraints.  
Use
<span class="menu">MOE | Footer | <i>forcefield</i> | Restraints</span>
to review or delete restraints.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
When ready to perform the energy minimization, choose
<span class="menu">MOE | Compute | Energy Minimize</span> and the panel
on the left will appear (the "forcefield" version).  The panel on the right
(the "MOPAC" version) is obtained by selecting either the PM3, AM1 or
MNDO Hamiltonian option.  Both versions of the panel are described below.

<td valign="top"><b>Hamiltonian</b></td>
<td valign="top">
The Hamiltonian option (and related controls) selects the potential energy
model that will be used for the energy minimization calculation.  The
default value of Forcefield means that the currently loaded forcefield,
current potential setup and current restraints will be used for the

of the Hamiltonian option.
<p>
If either of PM3, AM1 or MNDO is selected, then the MOPAC program will be
used to perform the energy minimization.  Due to the computational demands,
only small systems can be handled.  The next option to the right of the
Hamiltonian (in the panel on the right) controls the type of quantum
mechanical calculation to perform.  RHF means Restricted Hartree-Fock,
UHF means Unrestricted Hartee-Fock, Biradical means that the system is
constrained to have two unpaired electrons and Excited means that the system
is in an excited state.  The <b>Spin State</b> can be one of
All (meaning all spin states), Singlet, Doublet, Triplet, Quartet,

be created.  Lone pair atoms will be deleted for the PM3, AM1 and MNDO
Hamiltonians.

Energy minimization will be terminated when the root mean square gradient
falls below the specified value.  The root mean square gradient is the

For vibrational analysis, the RMS gradient should be smaller than
10<sup>-5</sup>.

In the panel on the right, the text field to the right of Gradient is
provided so that MOPAC keywords can be supplied to MOPAC.  The
(somewhat arcane) MOPAC keywords are used to control the behavior of the

a fixed atom; that is, atoms that are tethered with a weight greater than

<h2><a name="DBMin">3D Database Minimization</a></h2>

<p>
In many instances, a database contains a collection of molecules for which
3D structures must be built and/or energy minimized. To perform an
operation such as this, MOE provides a database energy minimization
application, which can be used in the following situations:

<ul>
<li><b>Clustering of Dynamics Output</b>.
Suppose that a database contains a molecular dynamics trajectory.
In order to cluster the conformations, it is often necessary to minimize 
the energy of each conformer first.

<p>
<li><b>3D Conversion of SMILES Strings</b>.
Suppose that an ASCII file containing SMILES strings has been imported into a
database.  If 3D properties are to be calculated on the molecules, then it is
necessary to calculate a 3D structure from each SMILES string.

<p>
<li><b>3D Conversion of SD Files</b>. 
Suppose that an SD file has been imported.  Typically SD files contain 2D
drawings of molecules.  If 3D structures are desired then it is necessary to
convert each 2D drawing into a 3D structure.
</ul>


<h2><a name="Method">Methodology</a></h2>

<p>
The method used to construct 3D structures from molecular connection
tables is <i>four-dimensional energy minimization</i>.  The four
dimensions used are four atomic spatial dimensions: <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>,
<i>z</i> and <i>w</i>.  In other words, the position of each atom is given
by a four-dimensional vector (in contrast to the usual three-dimensional
vector).  The motivation behind this method is that, in four-dimensional
space, energy barriers are more easily surpassed than in 3D space, making
energy minimization a viable 3D structure converter.

<p>
Although it is very difficult to visualize four-dimensional space, we will
describe the calculation by way of analogy.  Suppose that molecules
exist only in two dimensions, i.e. on a flat piece of paper.  Consider
the C-O-C molecule crossing the energy barrier between its two-dimensional
conformations:

<p><center><img src="emin/coc.gif"></center></p>

<p>When the atoms are colinear, the potential energy is very high and the
molecule is highly strained; therefore, it is difficult to cross this
barrier.  Suppose we add an extra spatial dimension: the third dimension.
In this case, moving into the third dimension creates a low-energy path
between the two conformations:

<p><center><img src="emin/coc3d.gif"></center></p>

<p>
In other words, we can move between the two conformations without changing
the angle between the atoms (thereby keeping the energy constant).  The same
idea holds true when moving from three to four dimensions: <i>it is
easier to cross energy barriers by introducing another spatial dimension</i>.
However, in 4D more complicated scenarios are possible such as atoms
passing through atoms, bonds passing through rings, etc.  The 
<a href="../moe/pot.htm">MOE potential energy model</a> provides for
evaluating potential energies in four spatial dimensions.  This means that
forcefields such as MMFF94 or AMBER are defined in 4D.  It is
thus possible to minimize the potential energy of a molecular system in
four dimensions.

<p>
This fundamental capability is used to construct molecules from connection
tables in the following algorithm:

<ol>
<li><b>Initialize.</b>  Assign to each atom a random four-dimensional
position
(<i>x<sub>i</sub></i>,<i>y<sub>i</sub></i>,<i>z<sub>i</sub></i>,<i>w<sub>i</sub></i>).

<p>
<li><b>4D Minimization.</b> Perform energy minimization in four dimensions
to calculate a low energy 4D conformation.
<p>
<li><b>Projection.</b>  For successively increasing values of <i>p</i>, minimize
the function <nobr><i>U</i>(<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>,<i>z</i>,<i>w</i>)</i>
+ <i>p</i> <i>w</i><sup>T</sup><i>w</i></nobr> where <i>U</i> is the potential
energy and <i>w</i> are the coordinates in the fourth dimension.
<p>
<li><b>3D Minimization.</b> Delete the <i>w</i> (fourth dimension) coordinates
of each atom and minimize the potential function
<i>U</i>(<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>,<i>z</i>).
</ol>

<p>
Alternatively, the external (third-party) program Corina may be used to
convert SMILES or 2D structures to 3D structures.  In order to use this
capability, the Corina program must be installed and either in the path or
specified in the <tt>corina.exe</tt> entry of the MOE configuration
file (e.g. <tt>corina.exe=/usr/local/bin/corina</tt> in the file
<tt>$HOME/.moe-rc</tt>).

<h2><a name="Minimizing">Minimizing the Database</a></h2>

<p>Before running the application, make sure that the currently loaded
forcefield is the desired one (<b><nobr>MOE | Window |
<a href="../moe/pot.htm">Potential Setup</a></nobr></b>).  
Databases typically contain
small molecules so be sure to use a forcefield that has been parameterized
for small molecules.

<p>
Open a database in a <a href="../mdb/db.htm">Database Viewer</a> and choose 
<b><nobr>DBV | Compute | Molecule | Energy Minimize</nobr></b>.  If MOE
already contains molecular data, you will be prompted to close it 
(the minimization calculation
requires that no prior data be loaded in MOE).  The Database Minimize
panel appears:

<p><center><img src="emin/dbmin.png" alt="Database Minimize Panel"></center></p>

<p>The Database Minimize panel includes the following options:

<p>
<table width=100% cellpadding=5>
<tr>
<td valign=top width=25%><b>Database</b></td>
