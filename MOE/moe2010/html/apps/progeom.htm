<!-- ============================== OVERVIEW ============================= -->

<p><a name="Overview"></a></p><h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
As macromolecular crystal structures are determined and refined in an
increasingly automated fashion, careful assessment of the reliability and
quality of the resulting models becomes increasingly important, especially
when these structures are used in the comparative modeling process. The
Protein Geometry application provides a variety of stereochemical
measurements for inspection of the structural quality in a given protein:

<ol>
<li>Backbone bond lengths, angles and dihedrals.
<li>Ramachandran &phi;-&psi; dihedral plots.
<li>Sidechain rotamer quality.
<li>Nonbonded contact quality.
</ol>

</p><p>
For the evaluation of the &phi;-&psi; torsion quality, an updated and refined 
reference dataset [Lovell&nbsp;2003] serves as the basis for identifying
potentially erroneous protein backbone topologies. The sidechain rotamers
are assessed by the rotamer strain energies calculated from the probability
factors obtained from a backbone-dependent rotamer library [Dunbrack&nbsp;1997].
</p>
<p>
The user interface of the Protein Geometry application offers two
distinct views on the result sets: 
<ol type=a>
<li>
Scatter plots provide a quick overview of the entire data set
(e.g. Bond Lengths, &phi;-&psi; Plots etc.) and allow interactive
selection of residues of interest. Overall trends can be
visualized and localized to certain domains within the protein. In addition, 
the plots may be exported into common graphic formats
(e.g. GIF, PNG, JPG, EMF, etc.) for use in other applications.
<p>
<li>
Data Lists give a more detailed representation of the results by listing 
the benchmark data of a particular category in a table. A variety of
interface controls (e.g. checkboxes for sub-categories of the dataset, various 
possibilities for sorting, sliders, etc.)
enable efficient browsing and filtering of the results and help 
in finding potential outliers or subsets of interest. The content of the
tables may also be copied into the clipboard and imported into other
applications.
</ol>

<p>
The Report Panel provides a summary of the stereochemical evaluation of
a given protein in the form of an ASCII file.

<!-- ============================ METHODOLOGY ============================ -->

<p><a name="Method"></a></p><h2>Methodology</h2>

<p>
This section contains an overview of the methods and calculations underlying 
the distinct functions on the Protein Geometry application.

Backbone Bond lengths, angles and dihedrals are compared to averages
and standard deviations of a reference database of
high resolution structures from the May&nbsp;2007 Protein Data Bank (PDB).
The following criteria were used to select reference database entries:
</p>

<ol>
<li> Resolution of 1.3&nbsp;&Aring; or better. The electron density map of
these structures at this range is so clear that alternate occupancies become
more distinguishable with fewer constraints required during the refinement
procedure. The level of detail at this resolution should provide a more
"realistic" - closer to experimental data - dataset when used in statistical
analysis.
<li>R<sub>free</sub> value of 0.25 or lower.
<li>B-Factor values of backbone atoms of 30 or lower.
<li>Backbone atom occupancy of 100%.
</ol>

<p>
Protein chains with sequence identity of 95% or higher have been removed
from the collection as well as residues with erroneous backbone topology
(e.g. incorrect topology or missing atoms).
The resulting reference database consists of 129,858 residues originating
from 556 protein structures.
</p>

<p><a name="MethodDefAndVal"><b>Backbone Definitions and Values</b>.
The depictions below outline the respective definitions of backbone bonds,
angles and dihedrals and, for each measurement, list the expected values as
calculated from the reference database.  The reference database statistics
are to for calculating the Z-Scores (number of standard deviations from the
expected value) of a particular measurement (length, angle or dihedral).
The atom backbone names are denoted as follows:

<p>
<center>
<table class="titlebar">
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Atom</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>N
<td>Backbone nitrogen atom of a residue.
<tr>
<td>CA
<td>Backbone &alpha; carbon atom of a residue.
<tr>
<td>C
<td>Backbone carbonyl carbon atom of a residue.
<tr>
<td>O
<td>Backbone carbonyl oxygen atom of a residue.
<tr>
<td>pCA
<td>Backbone &alpha; carbon atom of the <i>previous</i> residue.
<tr>
<td>pC
<td>Backbone carbonyl carbon atom of the <i>previous</i> residue.
<tr>
<td>pO
<td>Backbone carbonyl oxygen atom of the <i>previous</i> residue.

<p>
Since the number of <i>cis</i>-omega dihedrals (peptide dihedrals) was too
small to deduce reasonable statistics, the expected values were taken from
[Jabs&nbsp;1999].

<p><a name="MethodPhiPsi"></a><b>&phi;-&psi; Reference Data</b>.
The &phi; and &psi; backbone dihedrals are correlated; consequently, they
are scored using 2-dimensional probability distributions calculated
on a high-resolution collection of X-ray structures containing approximately
100,000 residues from 500 protein structures [Lovell&nbsp;2003].
Each probability distribution was estimated with a 2 degree spacing for
each of &psi; and &phi; with separate histograms for proline, glycine,
pre-proline and general amino acids.
The histograms reveal sharp edges and clear delineation between large empty 
areas and regions that are allowed but disfavored. 

<p align=center>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
<b>Fig. 5:</b> <i>Contours of Allowed (orange) and Core (green)
Regions of Ramachandran Maps</i>.</p>
</p>

<p><a name="MethodRotamer"></a><b>Rotamer Reference Data</b>.
Quality estimates for a particular protein sidechain are calculated
based on the backbone-dependent rotamer library published by Dunbrack
and Cohen [Dunbrack&nbsp;1997].

The rotamer statistics were collected for each &phi;-&psi; combination
in 10 degree increments and smoothed with Bayesian methods.
The backbone dependency of sidechain rotamers is 
restricted to the &chi;1-angle; the remaining &chi; angles
are independent of the backbone &phi;-&psi; values.
For a given backbone &phi;-&psi; combination, the resulting probabilities
provide estimates of weakly or strongly populated sidechain rotamers
in the PDB.
The SCWRL strain estimate [Bower&nbsp;1997] is derived from the probabilities
using

<p align=center>
<img src="progeom/formularotlib.png" width="400">
</p>

<p>
where <i>R</i> is the residue type (ALA, GLU, etc.), and <i>K</i> is a
constant, set to 3.0 based on optimization of the energy function for
a 180-protein test set.
The argument of the log is normalized to the highest probability
rotamer (defined as <i>r<sub>i</sub></i>= 1), so that the energy of this
rotamer is zero and all others are positive.

<p>
The Protein Geometry application uses a different measure of strain
derived using a statistical mechanical identity:

<p align=center>
<img src="progeom/rotstrainE.png" width="400">
</p>

<p>
Here, <i>E<sub>i</sub></i> denotes the energy of Rotamer type i,
<i>E</i><sub>avg</sub> the average energy of rotamer <i>i</i> assuming
a Boltzmann distribution, <i>k</i> is the Boltzmann Constant, <i>T</i> the
temperature (298&nbsp;K) and <i>p<sub>i</sub></i> is the unit normalized
probability distribution of rotamer <i>i</i>.
The rotamer strain energy is then
<i>E<sub>i</sub></i>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<i>E</i><sub>avg</sub>, which can be
negative.

<p><a name="MethodClash"></a><b>Calculation of Repulsion Energy</b>.
The repulsion energy measurement is used to determine van der Waals clashes
in a macromolecular structure.  Each non-hydrogen atom is assigned a radius
and a van der Waals optimal interaction energy value and a distance-dependent
function is used to estimate the van der Waals repulsion energy between
two atoms.
The van der Waals radii and well-depth parameters are those of the
Engh-Huber forcefield [Engh&nbsp;1991] commonly used in crystallographic
refinement.
The distance-dependent interaction function is
<p align=center>
<i>w</i> 800&nbsp;(1&nbsp;-&nbsp;<i>r</i>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<i>R</i>)<sup>3</sup>
</p>

<p>
where <i>r</i> is the interatomic separation distance, <i>R</i> is the
sum of the van der Waals radii, and <i>w</i> is the geometric mean of the
well-depth parameters of the two atoms.
Figure 6 compares various functional forms for a carbon-carbon
interaction: Lennard-Jones 12-6 and 9-6, the 800R3 function (above)
and the SCWRL [Bower&nbsp;1997] function (often used in homology modeling).
</p>
<p align=center>
<img src="progeom/vdwfcn.gif" alt="Functional forms of vdwEnergy">
<br />&nbsp;<br />
<b>Fig. 6:</b> <i>Functional Forms of VDW Interaction Energy</i>.
</p>

<p>
The 800R3 function lies in between the Lennard-Jones 12-6 and 9-6 potentials
and models only the repulsive part of the van der Waals interactions (which
is more appropriate in implicit solvent model conditions).
Close contacts are &quot;capped&quot; to avoid unrealistically
large energy values.
</p>

<p><a name="MethodACE"></a><b>Atomic Contact Energy</b>.
The calculation of the effective atomic contact energies (ACE) - the 
desolvation free energies required to transfer atoms from water to a protein's 
interior - is based on the publication of Zhang et al. [Zhang&nbsp;1997]. 
The contact desolvation energies are calculated for 18 different atom types 
of the 20 
common amino acids that are resolved based on the clustering pattern of 
their properties [Zhang&nbsp;1997]. 
The contact potentials for each atom type are measured within a contact range 
of 6 Angstroms by explicitly accounting for neighboring interactions. The 
definition of chain neighbors is classified in terms of a connectivity matrix 
Con(i,j), where i and j are the connectivity classes of the contact pair in 
question:
<p align=center>
<img src="progeom/connmatrix.png" alt="Neighbor Connectivity Matrix">
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<b>Fig. 7:</b> <i>Neighbor Connectivity Matrix</i>.
</p>

where the first index position of the matrix denotes the backbone nitrogen 
atoms, 
the second the C&alpha; atoms, the third the backbone C atoms, and the fourth 
any of the side-chain atoms. Contact pairs are eliminated from the calculation,
if any atom of connectivity class i in residue k<sub>i</sub> and any contact 
atom in connectivity class j in residue k<sub>j</sub> (k<sub>j</sub> >= 
k<sub>i</sub>) satisfy the following condition:

    <h3 align="center">
	k<sub>j</sub> - k<sub>i</sub> &lt;= Con(i,j)
    </h3>


<p>The unscaled pairwise atomic desolvation energies (e<sub>ij</sub>) are given 
in units of RT and converted to kcal/mol by a transformation factor 
[Zhang&nbsp;1997].

<!-- ============================ APPLICATION ============================ -->
<p><a name="Run"></a></p><h2>Running the Application</h2>

The Protein Geometry application can be accessed in the MOE window with
<nobr><b>MOE | Compute | Biopolymer | Protein Geometry</b></nobr>
or via the Sequence Editor with
<nobr><b>SE | Measure | Protein Geometry</b></nobr>.

The Protein Geometry application is an interface for launching various
protein checking routines and can conceptually be divided in two sections
The upper section provides means to define which residues are included in

The following sections describe the particular display modes for showing
results in the Protein Geometry application.

<p>
<a name="RunPhiPsi"></a>
<img src="progeom/ramplot.png" class="floatright">
<b>&phi;-&psi; Plot (Ramachandran)</b>.
Perhaps the best-known, and certainly most powerful, check for the
stereochemical quality of a protein is the &phi;-&psi; Plot (Ramachandran Plot).
<p>
The 2D data points of &phi; and &psi; backbone torsion angles tend to cluster
in favorable regions and tend to be excluded from certain disallowed regions
due to steric hindrance of sidechain atoms. Glycine and Proline, which have
no sidechains as such, along with amino acids preceding Prolines show a
different distribution pattern on the map (see Methodology above).
<p>
The plot combines the four separate Ramachandran maps (as shown to the right)
using shapes to distinguish the membership to a particular class (General,
Proline, Glycine and Pre-Proline). Within this scheme, Glycines are shown
as diamonds, Prolines as triangles, residues preceding Prolines (Pre-Proline)
have a rectangular shape, otherwise (General case) they are drawn as small
squares.

<p>
The color scheme encodes the affiliation to a certain region within
the respective Ramachandran Map. Residues in the core region are rendered in
green or yellow if they are found to be in the allowed region and red if in
the outlier region.  Outliers are always marked as crosses, independent of
their class.

<p>
The <b>Color</b> Option allows for viewing the plot in either black or white 
background color. When <b>White</b> background is selected the above mentioned
coloring scheme for assignment to core, allowed or outlier region within the
map is not used; instead filled or non-filled shapes are used to make
class distinctions.

<p align=center>
<img src="progeom/ramlegend.png">
</p>

<p>
The Data mode shows a list of the data used to make the plot.  The chain
name and number, residue name and number are displayed one-per-line.
The measured &phi; and &psi; values are also listed along with the likelihood
score of the combination.  An assessment is also given indicating whether
the values are allowed or are outliers.
Using the <b>Sort by</b> option enables detection of interesting data sets by 
the columns in the list.
When <b>Select Atoms</b> is pressed, residue atoms in highlighted list lines
will be selected in the MOE window.  The <b>Outliers Only</b> button can be
used to restrict the list to display outliers only.
<p align="center"><img src="progeom/ramdata.png"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
<img src="progeom/blengthplot.png" class="floatright">
<a name="RunLength"></a><b>Bond Lengths</b>.
The Bond Length plot shows the quality of backbone bond lengths on a
Z-Score scale (standard deviations from expectation) as defined in
<a href="#bblen">Figure&nbsp;2</a> (above).
<p>
The Z-Score profiles are shown in three separate plots.
The plot on the top depicts the bond lengths centered around the backbone
nitrogen (the backbone bonds pC-N and N-CA respectively).
The plot in the middle displays the bond lengths of the backbone 
C&alpha; atom (bonds with backbone C and CB respectively).
The plot on the bottom depicts the bond lengths of the backbone
C atom with C&alpha; and backbone oxygen.
<p>
The 
X-axis of these plots shows the residues in sequential order within MOE; the 
Y-axis is the Z-Scores of the particular backbone bond length. 
A Z-Score cutoff of 4.0 is marked by the dotted horizontal line colored in
dark red. 
Residues with values above this cutoff should be seen as outliers.
Residues that are selected in the MOE Window are drawn as circles and
can be selected interactively in the plots. In order to facilitate 
standardized viewing the Z-Score values are clamped to 5.5.
<p>
The <b>Color</b> Option allows for viewing the plots with either a black or 
white background. Press the <b>Definitions</b> button to raise a window with
the backbone definitions and expected values as shown in 
<a href="#bblen">Figure&nbsp;2</a>.

<p>
The bond length data can also be viewed in a tabular list when the
<b>Display</b> is set to Data.
In this mode, the values of the various bond data and Z-Scores are displayed.
The <b>Sort by</b> option facilitates sorting of the presented data set
by the entries of a chosen data column. This feature might be helpful in
finding data subsets of interest. The corresponding residue atoms of selected
entries in the list may also be selected in the MOE Window by pressing
the <b>Select Atoms</b> Button. 
Outliers - entries with Z-Score values larger than a given Z-Score cutoff - can 
easily be identified by checking <b>Outliers Only</b>.  By default, the Z-Score 
cutoff is set to 4.0 but may be set to a desired value specified in the 
<b>Z-Score Threshold</b> field.

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<img src="progeom/angleplot.png" class="floatright">
<a name="RunAngle"></a><b>Bond Angles</b>.
The Bond Angle plot shows the quality of backbone bond angles on a
Z-Score scale (standard deviations from expectation) as defined in
<a href="#bbang">Figure&nbsp;3</a> (above).
<p>
The Z-Score profiles are shown in three separate plots.
The plot on the top depicts the bond angles centered around the backbone
nitrogen (the backbone bonds pCA-pC-N and pC-N-CA respectively).
The plot in the middle displays the bond angles of the backbone 
C&alpha; atom (pC-N-CA and N-CA-C respectively).
The plot on the bottom depicts the bond angles of the backbone
C atom with C&alpha; and backbone oxygen as well as with nitrogen and C&alpha;.
<p>
The 
X-axis of these plots shows the residues in sequential order within MOE; the 
Y-axis is the Z-Scores of the particular backbone bond angle. 
A Z-Score cutoff of 4.0 is marked by the dotted horizontal line colored in
dark red. Residues with values above this cutoff should be seen as outliers.
Residues that are selected in the MOE Window are drawn as circles and
can be selected interactively in the plots. In order to facilitate 
standardized viewing the Z-Score values are clamped to 5.5.
<p>
The <b>Color</b> Option allows for viewing the plots with either a black or 
white background. Press the <b>Definitions</b> button to raise a window with
the backbone definitions and expected values as shown in Figure&nbsp;3.

<p>
The backbone angle data can also be viewed in a tabular list when the
<b>Display</b> is set to Data.
In this mode, the values of the various bond angles and Z-Scores are displayed.
The <b>Sort by</b> option facilitates sorting of the presented data set
by the entries of a chosen data column. This feature might be helpful in
finding data subsets of interest. The corresponding residue atoms of selected
entries in the list may also be selected in the MOE Window by pressing
the <b>Select Atoms</b> Button. 
Outliers - entries with Z-Score values larger than a given Z-Score cutoff - can 
easily be identified by checking <b>Outliers Only</b>.  By default, the Z-Score 
cutoff is set to 4.0 but may be set to a desired value specified in the 
<b>Z-Score Threshold</b> field.

<p>
<img src="progeom/dihedralplot.png" class="floatright">
<a name="RunDihedral"></a><b>Dihedrals</b>. 
The Dihedral plot shows the quality of backbone torsion angles on a
Z-Score scale (standard deviations from expectation) as defined in
<a href="#bbdih">Figure&nbsp;4</a> (above).
<p>
As already seen with the bond length and angle plots, the Z-Score profiles are 
shown 
in three separate plots. The plot on the top depicts the profile of the omega 
torsion as defined in Figure 4 in the Methodology section above.
The plot in the middle shows the planarity and &phi;/&psi; profiles, and the 
one on the 
bottom the profile of the C&beta; torsion angle. It is worth noting that the 
calculations of the &phi; and &psi; profiles depend upon each other and are not 
separate. As a result, the profiles of &phi; and &psi; are identical.</p>

<p>
The X-axis of these plots shows the residues in sequential order within MOE; 
the Y-axis is the Z-Scores of the respective backbone dihedral. 
A Z-Score cutoff of 4.0 is marked by the dotted horizontal line colored in
dark red. Residues with values above this cutoff should be seen as outliers.
Residues that are selected in the MOE Window are drawn as circles and
can be selected interactively in the plots. In order to facilitate 
standardized viewing the Z-Score values are clamped to 5.5.
<p>
The <b>Color</b> Option allows for viewing the plots with either a black or 
white background. Press the <b>Definitions</b> button to raise a window with
the backbone definitions and expected values as shown in Figure&nbsp;4.

<p>
The backbone dihedral data can also be viewed in a tabular list when the
<b>Display</b> is set to Data.
In this mode, the values of the various bond angles and Z-Scores are displayed.
The <b>Sort by</b> option facilitates sorting of the presented data set 
by the entries of a chosen data column. This feature might be helpful in 
finding data subsets of interest. The corresponding residue atoms of selected 
entries in the list may also be selected in the MOE Window by pressing 
the <b>Select Atoms</b> Button. The collection of dihedral data can be 
selected by checking the checkboxes in <b>Torsions</b>. 
Outliers - entries with Z-Score values larger than a given Z-Score cutoff - can 
easily be identified by checking <b>Outliers Only</b>.  By default, the Z-Score 
cutoff is set to 4.0 but may be set to a desired value specified in the 
<b>Z-Score Threshold</b> field.

<p>
<img src="progeom/rotamerplot.png"  class="floatright">
<a name="RunRotamer"></a><b>Rotamer</b>. 
The Plot depicts the rotamer strain energy (kcal/mol) calculated as outlined in 
the Methodology section above. The X-Axis shows the residues in sequential 
order within MOE. Residues with strain energies larger 
than 5.0 kcal/mol (marked by the dotted horizontal line in dark red color) 
are infrequent in the PDB and warrant a closer inspection. The strain energy 
threshold of the result set may be adjusted with the <b>E-Threshold</b> slider 
reducing the results to entries with strain energies above the designated 
cutoff. The <b>Color</b> option allows for setting the background color either 
to black or white.
</p>

<p>
The rotamer data can be viewed in a table when the <b>Display</b> option is set 
to <b>Data</b>. The Residues are labeled by affiliation to chains and 
by ID field number in the PDB files. For each rotamer, the backbone 
&phi; and &psi; angles and their respective side chain torsions (&chi; angles) 
are listed as well as the rotamer strain energy (kcal/mol) and probability 
factor as obtained from the rotamer library. The results 
can be sorted by each of these categories as outlined in <b>Sort by</b>. 
Pressing the <b>Select Atoms</b> button facilitates the selection of 
the corresponding atoms in the MOE Window as selected in the table. 
The cutoff for rotamer strain energy is adjustable by moving the 
<b>E-Threshold</b> slider. As with the Plot, only entries with strain energies 
above the designated value will then be listed.

<p>
<a name="RunClashes"></a><b>Atom Clashes</b>.
The clashing of two non-bonded atoms is defined by a positive repulsion energy 
term (in kcal/mol) as outlined in Methodology (above). In <b>Plot</b> viewing 
mode, the sum of the repulsion energies for each residue's atoms is plotted on 
the Y axis in kcal/mol. 
The X-Axis shows the residues in sequential order within MOE. 
The <b>Options</b> checkboxes control which interactions are included in the 
calculations:</p>

<p>The sensitivity for an atom clash can be adjusted by the 
<b>E-Threshold</b> slider and is set to 0.5 kcal/mol by default. 
Contact pairs with repulsion energies lower than 
this value will then be discarded from the result set.
<p>The Plot can also be viewed with either a white or black background as 
specified in <b>Color</b>.
</p>
<p>

If <b>Display</b> is set to Data, information about each clashing 
pair is displayed in a table. The respective clashing atoms are specified 
by chain name, residue name, residue ID number in the PDB files and atom name 
and are listed together with distance of their respective atom centers 
(in&nbsp;&Aring;) and repulsion energy (in kcal/mol). 
As for the Plot display, clicking the <b>Options</b> checkboxes 
defines the interactions included in the atom clash analysis. 
When selected in the entry list, the clashing 
atoms can be selected in the MOE Window by clicking the 
<b>Select Atoms</b> button. All atoms of a residue containing a clashing atom 
can be selected by clicking <b>Select Residues</b>. 
Pressing the <b>Isolate Selected</b> button changes the viewing mode of the 
MOE Window altogether. In this mode, only the residues of the clashing 
atoms will be shown in the MOE Window along with the distance between 
the clashing atoms, which are displayed as balls. This procedure 
facilitates inspection of the clashing partners as listed in the 
table. 
The previous settings in the MOE Window can be restored by clicking the 
<b>Reset View</b> button. 
Using the <b>Sort by</b> option allows the data to be sorted by the residue 
name of either of the clashing atoms, the clash distance or the repulsion energy. 
The sensitivity of the atom clash is set to 0.5 kcal/mol by default and may be 
adjusted by moving the <b>E-Threshold</b> slider resulting in elimination of 
entries with repulsion energies lower than the designated cutoff value.

<a name="RunACE"></a><b>Contact Energies</b>.
The effective atomic contact energies (ACE) are calculated for heavy atoms of 
standard amino acids within a contact range of 6 &Aring;, assigning energy terms 
(in kcal/mol) for each contact pair as outlined in Methodology (above). These 
energies are summed for each residue in the system. In general, a large 
negative value indicates that the residue is predominantly in contact with 
hydrophobic atoms and therefore expected to be in a buried protein environment. 
Residues with positive energy terms indicate contacts with predominantly 
hydrophilic atoms, and so are expected to be in more solvent-exposed regions 
of the protein.
In <b>Plot</b> viewing mode, the contact energies in kcal/mol are shown on the Y-Axis,
while the position of the residue within the MOE system is shown on the X-Axis. 
Residues containing selected atoms in the MOE Window are drawn as circles, 
and can be selected interactively in the plot.

<p>The Plot can also be viewed with either a white or black background as 
specified in <b>Color</b>.
</p>
<p>
In Data viewing mode (<b>Display</b> is set to Data) the contact energies of 
each residue is displayed in a table specified by chain name, residue name, 
residue UID number and energy value (kcal/mol). 
Atoms of selected residues in the list can be selected by clicking 
<b>Select Atoms</b>. Data in the table may be sorted by the 
options in the <b>Sort by</b> menu.

The results of the stereochemical measurements in the Protein Geometry 
application may be summarized in a report by pressing the <b>Report</b> button. 
The required topics can be chosen using the checkboxes, and cutoff-values set 
each of the topics, except Ramachandran Plot. 
For the report, these cutoffs may be set to different values.
<p>
<b>Data Set</b> controls what data from each topic is included in the report.
Selecting <b>all</b> will write all the data, whereas if <b>exceptions</b> is 
selected only 
the outliers of the respective topics will be written. If <b>Display</b> in 
the Protein Geometry Application is set to Data, an additional option, 
<b>listed data</b>, is presented. If this is used, the report will only contain the 
data currently shown in the Protein Geometry application. 
The content of the report is shown in the SVL Text Editor, as shown below in an 
excerpt from a report file.
