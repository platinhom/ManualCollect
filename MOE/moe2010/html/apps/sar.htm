<!-- ============================== OVERVIEW ============================= -->

<p><a name="Overview"></a><h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The Structure-Activity Report is a MOE application which generates a web
page housing an interactive view onto a collection of molecules which
are related by a small number of related common scaffolds. The application
is designed to operate on small databases of drug-like molecules which are
in the process of being refined for improved binding affinity and other
pharmacological properties.

<p>The input data is typically a collection of lead candidate structures,
ideally consisting of between 100 and 1000 molecules, each of which
features an activity value for inhibition of at least one drug target.
Detection of common scaffolds can be done automatically, or the user can
supply suggestions. Correlation and assignment of molecules to multiple
possible scaffolds is achieved by an algorithm which can operate with or
without guidance from the operator. Specialized depiction methods are used
to present scaffolds and R-groups.

<p>The HTML page which is generated by the report application contains a
number of tabs for examining the common scaffolds, R-groups, structure vs.
activity, fragmentation, and various graphs and interactive widgets. The
output can be viewed independently of MOE, but major changes to the content
such as adding molecules or modifying the scaffolds requires rebuilding the
page.

<p>Reports can be generated using a panel from an interactive session of
MOE, using a MOE molecular database or an MDL SD-file as the main input.
The default browser will be launched when the generation is complete.
Alternatively, the Structure-Activity Report can be accessed from MOE/web,
which allows input data and parameters to be specified through the portal
page. Thirdly, the reports can be generated from the command line, using
MOE/batch, which allows the process to be scripted.

<!-- ========================== METHODOLOGY ========================== -->

<p><a name="Methodology"></a><h2>Methodology</h2>

<p>The scaffold detection and assignment procedure has been published in the
literature [Clark 2009]. The calculations which are required to produce the
Structure-Activity Report proceed through the following steps:

<ol>

<p><li>Gather input data (molecules, activity, predefined scaffolds, etc.).

<p><li>Detect common scaffolds, if enabled, and append them to any
predefined scaffolds.

<p><li>If more than one scaffold is present, topologically align them to
produce a common numbering system.

<p><li>Assign the scaffolds by enumerating all possible substructure
matches, then minimizing a pairwise energy term which leads to the lowest
possible diversity of implied R-group substituents.

<p><li>Clip the implied R-groups and gather them into unique sets, then
decorate the scaffolds with numbered R-group labels.

<p><li>Produce a 2D layout for each scaffold such that the planar alignment
shows equivalent substitution positions.

<p><li>Render each of the molecules, scaffolds, R-groups and fragments as
images, as well as SD files.

<p><li>Write the HTML output, including any embedded information required
for interactivity in conjunction with the supporting JavaScript libraries.

</ol>

<!-- ================================ DATA =============================== -->

<p><a name="Data"></a><h2>Data</h2>

<p>The minimum requirement for generating a Structure-Activity Report is a
collection of molecules. Most of the features of the output only apply if
there is at least one field which is classified as an activity value, such
as a  K<sub>i</sub>, <i>p</i>K<sub>i</sub>, IC<sub>50</sub> or
<i>p</i>IC<sub>50</sub> measurement. Common scaffolds may be supplied by
the user, but if omitted, they will be calculated automatically.

<p><a name="Molecules"><h3>Molecules</h3>

<p>The molecular data for which the Structure-Activity Report will be
generated must be supplied in the form of either a MOE molecular database
(<tt>.mdb</tt>), or an MDL SD-file (<tt>.sdf</tt>). The number of input
molecules should be between 100 and 1000 molecules for ideal performance,
but larger or smaller datasets are possible.

<p>Each of the molecules should be a ligand which is relevant to the
particular project. Proteins must not be included in the molecule field.
Salts, adducts, solvent molecules, etc. should ideally be removed
first, though this can be done automatically. Best results are typically
obtained if the molecules are drawn in their neutral form, with whichever
tautomer state is most consistent throughout the series, rather than the
form which is thought to be adopted in a particular binding mode.

<p>If the coordinates of the input molecules are in the form of 2D
sketches, the existing coordinates may be used as layout hints during
depiction of automatically detected scaffolds [Clark 2006]. For SD files,
coordinates are used to determine stereochemistry for alkenes. The input
coordinates are otherwise unimportant, and all molecules will be redrawn
during the generation of the report.

<p><a name="Activities"><h3>Activities</h3>

<p>Many of the features provided in the final report are predicated on the
availability of at least on data field which is classified as a type of
activity. Examples of activity fields include:

<p><ul>
<li><tt>pKi/pIC50</tt>
<li><tt>Ki/IC50</tt>
<li><tt>percentages</tt>
<li><tt>boolean</tt>
</ul>

<p><a name="OtherFields"><h3>Other Fields</h3>

<p>Non-activity data field types numeric properties and text ID fields, which
are displayed in various parts of the report.

<p><a name="Scaffolds"><h3>Scaffolds</h3>

<p>In order for the scaffold categorization to be effective, it is
necessary for the majority of the molecules to be based on a small number of
common scaffolds. These common scaffolds should have significant points of
structural similarity with one another, such that they form an analogous
series. For example, the following two molecules are obviously based on a
similar scaffold:

<div align="center">
<img src="sar/analog_1.png" />
<img src="sar/analog_2.png" />
</div>

<p>The following two molecules do not obviously share a common scaffold
motif:

<div align="center">
<img src="sar/analog_3.png" />
<img src="sar/analog_4.png" />
</div>

<p>For datasets containing molecules which are largely based on the same
scaffold, or largely based on scaffolds which have a high degree of
structural similarity, the automated scaffold detection and analysis
algorithms are likely to be effective. For molecules based on
scaffolds which are very different from one another, but nonetheless have
consistent meaning throughout the series, it may be necessary to provide
the scaffolds as input, since the automatic detection methods may fail to
find all of the scaffolds, or may fail to align them correctly.  Molecules
which are based on scaffolds that are not primarily ring blocks are less
likely to be detected automatically, and may need their scaffolds to be
specified by the user.

<p>Scaffolds can be provided by the user in common molecular sketch
formats, e.g. MDL MOL files, or from the content of the MOE Window.
User-supplied scaffolds can optionally be augmented with scaffolds which
have been detected automatically.

<p>The minimum requirement for a user-specified scaffold is a substructure
fragment, with no special annotations. Scaffold substructure fragments may
only be decorated by singly bonded substituents, i.e. double, triple or
aromatic bonds to R-groups are forbidden. This means that partial aromatic
ring blocks will not match (e.g. benzene is not a scaffold substructure of
napthalene), nor will fragments with pendant double bonds (e.g. ethane is
not a scaffold substructure of ethanal). These restrictions can be
circumvented by supplying multiple scaffolds.  Bi- or multi-dentate
R-groups are allowed, which means that scaffold substructures can match
parts of ring blocks, as long as they are attached by single, non-aromatic
bonds. Tautomers and protonation states are applied as-drawn, and are not
automatically adjusted (e.g. keto forms of substructures will not match
molecules drawn in the enol form, nor will a neutral amine match a
protonated amine), but aromatic bonds drawn in the Kekul&eacute; form will be
normalized automatically.

<p>In the case of multiple scaffolds, it is typically presumed that the
data is part of an analogous series, which might be annotated as:

<div align="center">
<img src="sar/analogR_1.png" />
<img src="sar/analogR_2.png" />
</div>

<p>The positions indicated by R1 for each molecule are, for this example,
considered analogous substitution points, as are the positions indicated by
R2. These positions have common meaning for the molecules, regardless of
which of these two scaffolds they are based on. If the scaffolds are not
provided by the user, or the provided scaffolds have no extra annotation,
the equivalences of the substitution points will be calculated
automatically. In some cases, however, the relationship between the
substitution points is not obvious from the scaffold structure, or from the
available substituents, and so it can be necessary for the user to provide
this information. The most straightforward way to do this is to use the
Markush notation, as shown above, using R-group labels, with a common
numbering system throughout the series. These labels will be strictly
honored during the scaffold assignment process.

<!-- ============================== EXECUTION ============================ -->

<p><a name="Execution"></a><h2>Running SAReport</h2>

<p><a name="SetupPanel"></a><h3>Setup Panel</h3>

<p>The Structure-Activity Report can be generated from within an
interactive MOE session by choosing
<nobr><b>Compute | Simulation | SAReport... </b></nobr>, the
<nobr><b>DBV | Compute | SAReport... </b></nobr>,
or from within the <nobr><b>MOE | File | Open</b></nobr>
dialog, by selecting an MDB or SDF file, and
clicking on <nobr><b>Produce Structure Activity Report</b></nobr>. It can also
be accessed by running the file <nobr><tt>$MOE/lib/svl/run/sareport.svl
</tt></nobr>.

<p>The Structure-Activity Report setup panel is shown below in two states:
(1) initial blank, and (2) all fields fully specified:</p>


<div align="center">
<img src="sar/sareport_panel.png" alt="Structure-Activity Report Panel" />&nbsp;
<img src="sar/sareport_dhfr.png" />
</div>


<p>The fields in the setup panel are configured as follows:</p>

<table class="titlebar">

<tr>
<th>Section</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Scaffolds</b></td>
<td valign="top">

The top half of the setup panel is reserved for displaying any
user-specified scaffolds that will be used during the analysis. If no
scaffolds are provided, then automatic scaffold detection is compulsory. If
scaffolds have been provided, the <b>Auto-detect</b> checkbox may be used
to toggle whether the analysis searches for <i>additional</i> common
scaffolds, beyond those specified in this panel.

<p>Scaffolds can be obtained by clicking on the <b>Paste</b> or <b>Copy
From MOE</b> buttons, or they can be read from a file by clicking on the
<b>Browse...</b> button. To remove the scaffolds, click on <b>Clear</b>.
The currently defined scaffolds can be copied to the MOE window using the
<b>Copy To MOE</b> button.

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Title</b></td>
<td valign="top">

An optional title may be provided, which will be displayed in the
summary section of the resulting HTML page.

</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top"><b>Tabs</b></td>
<td valign="top">

The output report consists of a collection of tabs, each of which exposes a
particular feature. These tabs can be switched on or off with the corresponding
checkbox in the setup panel. Disabling any of the tabs will reduce the overhead
required to generate the corresponding data, which can lead to a smaller HTML
page, fewer images, and a shorter loading time for the resulting report. If the
tab is subsequently required, however, the only way to restore it is to
regenerate the report.

</td></tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Input File</b></td>
<td valign="top">

An input database file must be specified before the report can be produced.
The file must be a MOE molecular database (.mdb) or an MDL SD file (.sdf). The
file can be selected by using the <b>Browse...</b> button, or entered in the
text field. For the latter method, it is necessary to press the <tt>ENTER</tt>
key afterward, which will trigger an analysis of the fields contained within the
file.

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><b>Retain Analysis</b></td>
<td valign="top">

When the input file is a writable MOE Molecular Database (<tt>.mdb</tt>), this
checkbox may be enabled, which will cause the scaffold assignment information to
be stored in the database for future use. This means that after the report has
been generated, the list of scaffolds, and the way in which they are assigned to
individual molecules, will be retrieved next time the setup panel is run on the
database.

<p>Apart from conveniently storing the list of scaffolds within the same
database, this feature is particularly useful for datasets which grow over time.
Without retaining the analysis, it is possible that adding new molecules to a
dataset will change the way scaffolds are detected and assigned. When the
analysis is retained, it is assured that old molecules will always be assigned
to the same scaffolds in the same way, and newly added molecules will be
assigned with the underlying algorithms, using the existing pattern as a
guideline.

</td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">
<b><nobr>Selected Fields Only</nobr> 
<br /><nobr>Selected Entries Only</nobr></b></td>

<td valign="top">

If the input file is a MOE molecular database, which is currently open
with the database viewer, the entries and fields can be restricted to those
which are selected.

</td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">
<span class="menu">Grow Scaffolds</span>
</td>

<td valign="top">

If on and if the implied R-group substituents are completely uniform,
the scaffold will be grown by absorbing the substituents.  If off,
the scaffolds are used as-is.

</td></tr>


<tr><td valign="top"><b>Molecule Names</b></td>
<td valign="top">

If on, then the molecular name field for the input molecules will be
used to create an implied field. If all of the molecule names are blank,
this has no effect.

</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top"><b>Largest Component</b></td>
<td valign="top">

If on, each input molecule will be divided up into connected components,
and only the largest retained. This will usually strip out salts, solvents
or adducts.

</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top"><b>Neutralize</b></td>
<td valign="top">

If on, then charged molecules (acids and bases)
will be submitted to an algorithm which
attempts to remove charges by balancing the protonation state. For most
druglike molecules, this will result in a molecular species for which all
heavy atoms are neutral.

</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top"><b>Fields</b></td>
<td valign="top">

When an input database is defined, a list of non-molecular fields is provided.
The types for input fields are determined automatically, by matching the field
names and range of values with expected properties. The automatic type
determination may be overridden as necessary.

<p>When one or more of the fields in the list is selected, the drop-down
box labeled <b>Type</b> is made available, and may be used to specify the type
for the selected fields. The list of types is determined by the contents of the
<a href="#Units"><b>unit types file</b></a>.

<p>Two type options are always available: <tt>skip</tt>, which causes the field
to be ignored, and <tt>ID</tt>, which is used when the field is a short text
description, such as an ID number, name or registration code. Use of a large
number of ID fields, or ID fields which are more than several dozen characters
long, is not recommended, as it will impair the layout of the final report.

</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top"><b>Output To</b></td>
<td valign="top">

Generation of the Structure-Activity report involves the creation of a
large number of files, which are written to a user-supplied directory. By
default this is a subdirectory called <tt>sareport_html</tt> within the current
working directory. It should be changed as necessary. The directory will be
created if it does not exist.

<p>Note that if the output directory already contains files, they will
<i>not</i> be explicitly deleted, but they will be overwritten if they have
the same name. If a single directory is used to generate a
Structure-Activity Report multiple times, only the most recently generated
report will be available. There may be some residual files from previous
reports, which are not referenced.

</td></tr>

</table>

<p>Once configuration of the options is complete, press the <b>Produce</b>
button. If a directory needs to be created for the output, a confirmation
prompt will be issued. The generation of the Structure-Activity Report is
done independently of the panel, so it may be closed at any time. Once the
report is complete, the current browser will be launched, with the
resulting HTML document as the opening page.

<p><a name="MOEWeb"></a><h3>MOE/web</h3>

<p>The Structure-Activity Report is also implemented as part of the MOE/web
collection, and provides an entry point:</p>

<div align="center">
<img src="sar/moeweb1.png" />
</div>

<p>The entry page has a single section, which requires a file to be submitted.
Once the file has been subjected to a preliminary parsing, the MOE/web setup
page is presented:</p>

<div align="center">
<img src="sar/moeweb2.png" />
</div>

<p>The MOE/web setup page is largely analogous to the MOE panel equivalent.
The main difference is that MOE does not need to be installed on the
desktop from which the report was produced. The user must present an input
file, optionally provide scaffolds, clarify any numeric fields which were
not automatically typed, and select several options.

<p>The MOE/web server automatically manages the creation of an output
directory, and previously generated reports will reside on the server for a
certain duration.

<p><a name="Batch"></a><h3>Batch</h3>

<p>A report can be produced without an interface, by calling an SVL
function directly, e.g.

<pre>
    arg = [fn, dir, scaffolds, opt];
    run ['sareport.svl', arg, 'sareport_Generate'];
</pre>

<p>where <tt>fn</tt> is the filename of the input molecule source
and <tt>dir</tt> is the filename of the output directory. The
<tt>scaffolds</tt> parameter may be null, or an array of CTAB structures
which specify the scaffolds. <tt>opt</tt> is a tagged vector which contains
any optional behavior.

<p>To generate the report from MOE/batch, the following shell syntax can be
used, in POSIX environments:

<pre>
    $MOE/bin/moebatch -exec "arg = [fn, dir, scaffolds, opt]; \
                             run ['sareport.svl', arg, 'sareport_Generate']"
</pre>

<p><a name="Units"></a><h3>Unit Types File</h3>

<p>Unit schemes for activities and properties are programmable, and are read
from the file <nobr><tt>$MOE/web/sareport/units.txt</tt></nobr>.  If a copy of
the file exists in the current working directory, that will be used instead.

<p>It is possible to add or modify the way units work by editing this file.
There are two main types of units: activities and properties. Activities are
used to color-code molecules in various parts of the report. The unit types file
contains formula parameters necessary to transform the input data into
normalized values.

<p>The default activity types are:

<ul>

<p><li><b>pKi/pIC50</b>: activity values of the K<sub>i</sub> or IC<sub>50</sub>
type, originally in molar units, but converted to <tt>-log<sub>10</sub></tt>,
i.e. a value of 6 corresponds to 10<sup>-6</sup> mol/L, or 1 &mu;mol/L. This
scheme is balanced so that 6.5 is the mid-point. The mid-point for a particular
color scheme is the critical region, away from which the color change is rapid.
For the "heat-map" scheme, the mid-point is rendered in yellow, while higher
values are green and lower values are red.

<p><li><b>Ki/IC50</b>: activity values of the K<sub>i</sub> or IC<sub>50</sub>
type, in molar concentration. This scheme is balanced so that 10<sup>-6.5</sup>
is the mid-point.

<p><li><b>Ki/IC50(uM)</b>: as for the <b>Ki/IC50</b> type, except that the values
are provided in micro-molar concentration, i.e. the scale is multiplied by
10<sup>6</sup>.

<p><li><b>fraction</b>: the input values are supplied as numbers between 0 and
1, where 0 means inactive, while 1 means maximum activity. This can also be used
for boolean activity.

<p><li><b>percent</b>: as for <b>fraction</b>, except that the range is
0&ndash;100.

</ul>

<p>By default there is only one property type, which is named <b>property</b>.
It is not transformed in any way. Property types are only used for a limited
range of features with the report, e.g. graphs.

<p>For more information about configuring units, refer to the explanatory
comments in <nobr><tt>$MOE/web/sareport/units.txt</tt></nobr>.

<!-- =============================== RESULTS ============================= -->

<p><a name="Results"></a><h2>Results</h2>

<p>A large number of files are generated for each Structure-Activity
Report. Many of the primary output files are written to the directory
supplied during the generation steps (<tt>$OUTDIR</tt>), while the numerous
image files are placed in the <tt>$OUTDIR/img</tt> subdirectory, one level
deeper.

<p>The main entry point is <tt>$OUTDIR/index.html</tt>. Opening this page
in any modern browser should be sufficient to access all of the features of
the report. The following browsers have been tested:

<p><ul>
<li>Mozilla Firefox (versions 2 and 3)
<li>Internet Explorer (versions 6, 7 and 8)
<li>Konqueror (version 3.5)
<li>Safari (version 10.5)
<li>Opera (version 9.5)
<li>Chrome
</ul>


<p><a name="TabSummary"></a><h3>Summary</h3>

<p>When the Structure-Activity Report is opened in the browser, the
<b>Summary</b> tab is always shown first. The display should somewhat
resemble the following:</p>

<div align="center">
<img src="sar/tabsummary.png" />
</div>

<p>A section is created for each scaffold, which is denoted by the wide
turquoise bars. These sections can be checked open and closed by clicking
on the [+]/[-] icons on the left side.

<p>Within each section, the scaffold itself is displayed prominently on the
left, with numbered R-group decorations showing where substituents can be
found. Underneath the scaffold depiction is shown the number of molecules
which were assigned to the scaffold, and for each activity value, a summary
histogram providing a preliminary indication of the range of activity
values.

<p>To the right of the scaffold is a vertical list of each of the R-group
substitution positions found on the scaffold. To the right of each of these
labels is a graphical list of the unique set of substitutions which may be
found at that substitution position, on that scaffold.

<p>Moving the mouse over any one of the R-group values brings up a popup
window:</p>

<div align="center">
<img src="sar/mouseover.png" />
</div>

<p>The popup window shows information about each of the molecules which
possess the underlying R-group at the specific position on the indicated
scaffold. If there are more than 12 such molecules, then only a subset of
the molecules are shown. To see all of the molecules, left-click on the
R-group of interest, which will bring up a persistent popup window which
has its own scrollbar.

<p><a name="TabScaffolds"></a><h3>Scaffolds</h3>

<p>The <b>Scaffolds</b> tab allows the scaffolds to be edited, and also
provides information about any molecules in the dataset which did not match
a scaffold. When selected, the tab may look something like:</p>

<div align="center">
<img src="sar/tabscaffold.png" />
</div>

<p>The main part of the page is taken up by a Java sketcher applet, which shows
each of the scaffolds used within the current report. The sketcher may be used
to modify, add or remove scaffolds. To apply a different set of scaffolds, it is
necessary to rebuild the report, which can be done by clicking the <nobr><b>Copy
to Clipboard</b></nobr> button, then returning to the MOE setup panel, and using
the <b>Paste</b> button.

<p>Note that the sketcher applet requires Java 1.5 or later installed as a
browser plugin. Without a suitable version of Java, this feature will be
disabled.

<p>Underneath the sketcher applet is a list of <b>Unused Molecules</b>, for
which no scaffold was found, if there are any. Clicking on any of these
molecules will cause it to be pasted into the sketcher applet, which is a
convenient way to edit scaffold prototypes.

<p>The last section, entitled <b>Clipboard Information</b>, contains
browser-specific information for enabling use of the clipboard.

<p><a name="TabActivity"></a><h3>Activity</h3>

<p>The <b>Activity</b> tab has as its main focus a <b>Correlation Table</b>,
which singles out two degrees of freedom (scaffold, R1, R2, etc.), and plots
them against each other. An example of such a table is:</p>

<div align="center">
<img src="sar/tabactivity2.png" />
</div>

<p>As can be seen, the different scaffolds are plotted in the row axis header,
and the possible values for the R2 substituent are plotted in the column header.

<p>Each of the cells for which there is activity data is color coded. By
default, just one activity is plotted, and the "heat map" color scheme is used,
in which green denotes highly active, red denotes inactive, and yellow denotes
mediocre activity.

<p>The row and column headers each show bands of color, which represent the
average activity for the whole row or column. For individual cells which
represent one or two molecules, the numeric activity values are shown
explicitly; for more than 2, a range is given.

<p>Moving the mouse cursor over a non-empty cell, or a row or column heading,
brings up a popup menu which shows information about the compounds being
represented. Left-clicking brings up a persistent window with more detailed
information.

<p>Left-clicking on a cell or heading with the <tt>Ctrl</tt> key held down
causes the selection state of all represented compounds to be toggled on or off.

<p>Some of the empty cells may be represented with small "starburst" patterns
(groups of black dots arranged in a circle). These are shown when the
corresponding degrees of freedom (e.g. Scaffold + R2) for the cell are
unusually over-represented amongst compounds with greater than average activity.
In effect it is a statement that the available data suggests that a new
compound with these two features is likely to be more active than most of the
compounds currently in the dataset. The size of the starburst is proportional
to the weight of the prediction.

<p>Only one correlation table can be displayed at any given time, but its
contents can be adjusted using the controls which are shown above it, in the
<b>Activity Selector</b> panel:</p>

<div align="center">
<img src="sar/tabactivity3.png" />
</div>

<p>The Rows and Columns parts are used to select which degrees of freedom are
plotted along the two axes. Changing either of these will cause the content of
the table to be reconstructed. 

<p>The sort order for either of the axes may be selected. The default sorting of
"None" means that a predefined order is used for the entries in the table. When
sorting by "Popularity", the number of occurrences of compounds which have
non-null values for the currently selected activities is used as the sort order,
those most abundant being shown first. "Weight" causes sorting by the molecular
weight of the fragments, while "Activity" causes sorting by highest activity
first, with the first selected activity taking precedence.

<p>Up to three activities may be shown at once. By default only the first
activity is shown. Each of the selected activities may be assigned a color
scheme, from the selection of "Heat-map", "Magenta" and "Greyscale", which are
depicted above. The scale may optionally be inverted by clicking the so-named
checkbox. Underneath the color schemes is shown a color sampling palette, to
provide an idea of the activity values which correspond to certain colors.

<p>Each of the activity fields defined when generating the report is
represented. If there is more than one activity value, then additional fields
are automatically generated, one for each pairwise combination of activity
values, in the form of "A vs. B", "B vs. A", etc. These computed values are used
to plot selectivity. The color coding is chosen to represent the extend to which
the activity of the first value is greater than the second value.

<p>There are two ways in which color-coded activity data is shown in the
correlation table: by coloring the background with the average activity value of
the compounds, and by producing a "cartwheel" for each cell. The cartwheels are
divided into rungs (per activity) and spokes (per compound), and are a
particularly effective way of collapsing a large amount of information into a
small space:</p>

<div align="center">
<img src="sar/tabactivity4.png" />
</div>

<p>Underneath the main table is the <b>Constraints</b> section, which can be
used to exclude certain scaffolds and substituents from the table. Clicking on
any of the degrees of freedom opens up a small popup:</p>

<div align="center">
<img src="sar/tabactivity5.png" />
</div>

<p>Clicking on any of the fragments toggles its selection state. For example,
clicking on the "R1-CH3" and "R1-H" fragments so that both of them are toggled
on causes the correlation table to be updated so that only molecules with either
methyl or hydrogen at the R1-position are included, and all other compounds are
taken out of the table. When none (or all) of the fragments are selected, no
constraint is applied.

<p><a name="TabSuggestions"></a><h3>Suggestions</h3>

<p>The <b>Suggestions</b> tab consists of a list of hypothetical molecules,
constructed from available pieces, which are predicted to have a high
probability of activity.

<p>The pool of hypothetical molecules is prepared by enumerating all of the
input molecules, and performing single-point mutations at each of the
substituent positions, with each of the R-groups that have are observed in
the equivalent position for some other molecule in the dataset. The unique
list of chimeric molecules is then scored according to an estimate of
probability, scaled and balanced to match the distribution of activities
found in the input set. Hypothetical compounds with a probability value of 0.5
have an even chance of having better-than-average activity, while those with
higher probability values are increasingly likely to have higher activities.

<p>The list is presented in the following way:</p>


<div align="center">
<img src="sar/tabsuggestions.png" />
</div>

<p>The most promising candidates are listed first, and only those with a
probability of greater than 0.5 are considered. All of the compounds are
different from those in the actual dataset.

<p>The <b>Activity</b> of interest can be selected. By default the list contains
hypothetical molecules with any scaffold, but by clicking on an entry in the
<b>Filter Scaffolds</b> section, the list can be narrowed to one scaffold at a
time. Sometimes one or more of the scaffolds contributes no hypothetical
molecules which make the list, and these are shown with a white background, and
are not selectable.

<p><a name="TabExplore"></a><h3>Explore</h3>

<p>The <b>Explore</b> tab plots the relative similarities and activities of
all other molecules in the dataset around a single selected molecule, and
allows the set to be navigated interactively:</p>


<div align="center">
<img src="sar/tabexplore.png" />
</div>

<p>When the tab is opened, the first molecule is selected by default, which
is plotted as a single point in the cross-hairs of a large circle. All
other molecules are plotted as individual white dots.

<p>Molecules which have higher activity than the current molecule are
plotted <i>above</i> the vertically bisecting line, while those with lower
activity are plotted <i>below</i>.

<p>To the left of the horizontal divider are plotted molecules which have
the <i>same</i> scaffold as the selected molecules. The distance to the
left is proportional to the dissimilarity of the decorating R-group
substituents. To the right are plotted molecules which have
<i>different</i> scaffolds. The distance to the right is proportional to
the dissimilarity of the scaffold itself, if both are assigned, or the
whole molecule otherwise.

<p>Moving the mouse cursor over any of the white dots causes a popup window
to appear, which provides information about the molecules in that region of
the plot. Left-clicking on a point will navigate to the underlying
molecule, and redraws the explore plot accordingly.

<p>On the top right of the page, the activity which is under scrutiny may
be selected, if there are multiple activity values present. Information
about the currently selected molecule is shown.

<p>If there are any ID fields, then a search box is presented, which allows a
compound to be quickly located and made the new center of attention. After the
current compound has been changed for the first time, a <b>Back</b> button is
made available. Selected compounds are shown with a thicker black border.
Left-clicking on any of the compounds while holding the Ctrl-key toggles the
compound selection.

<p><a name="TabGraphs"></a><h3>Graphs</h3>

<p>Graphs can be composed from any two supplied or calculated properties. The
first section, the <b>Graph Selector</b>, allows the X- and Y-axes to be
selected. The available options consist of all of the activities and properties
which were submitted as part of the report. Molecular weight and calculated log
P are also added. For each activity, and the "efficiency" property is
calculated, which is obtained by dividing the normalized activity value
(0&ndash;1) by the number of heavy atoms in the molecule.</p>


<div align="center">
<img src="sar/tabgraph1.png" />
</div>

<p>To the right of the axes are shown the series, of which there is one for each
scaffold, with an extra case reserved for molecules with no assigned scaffold.
By default each of the scaffolds is plotted in a different color, which can be
changed by clicking on the desired color. Clicking on the "X" mark causes the
series to be not shown.

<p>The graph itself is shown underneath. This example plots an efficiency value
against calculated log P:</p>


<div align="center">
<img src="sar/tabgraph2.png" />
</div>

<p>Moving the mouse pointer over any of the dots brings up a popup with
information about the compound. Left-clicking on a dot switches to the
<b>Explore</b> tab, and makes the underlying dot the new current compound.
Holding the Ctrl-key and left-clicking on a dot toggles its selection state.

<p><a name="TabFragments"></a><h3>Fragments</h3>

<p>In the <b>Fragments</b> tab is shown a hierarchical breakdown of all of
the input molecules according to linear fragmentation rules
[Schuffenhauer 2007]:</p>


<div align="center">
<img src="sar/tabfrag.png" />
</div>

<p>Each of the input molecules is a leaf node on the tree, and each unique
final decomposition fragment is a root node. Branch nodes can be clicked
open and shut using the [+] and [-] buttons. The root nodes have extra
buttons, [++] and [--], which apply to all of the descendent nodes, not
just their immediate descendents.

<p>To the left of the molecular structures of non-leaf nodes is a compact
histogram of activity values for each of the molecules. In the case of
multiple activities, these are presented in the same order, top-down, as in
other tabs.

<p>To the right of the fragment molecular structures is shown the total
number of molecules which feature this fragment within the linear sequence.

<p>Note: the fragmentation sequence shown in this tab is the raw data which
is used by the scaffold detection algorithm used for the Structure-Activity
Report. It should not be confused with the actual scaffold assignment, which
undergoes additional levels of processing in order to determine the optimal
scaffold collection.

<p><a name="TabData"></a><h3>Data</h3>

<p>The <b>Data</b> tab presents a list of all of the input molecules, which
are segregated into sections based on the scaffold which they are assigned
to. The first section is devoted to <b>Search</b> features, which is followed
by one section for each scaffold:</p>


<div align="center">
<img src="sar/tabdata1.png" />
</div>

<p>Searching can be done based on exact matching of ID fields, or matching sets
of molecules with certain numeric values. It is possible to select a numeric
field, and search for a specific numeric value (with an optional tolerance) or
enter a range of values to select by. The current selection state can be
affected in several ways, which is explained on the page itself.

<p>Selected compounds are highlighted on the page itself. If there is more than
one selected compound, the <b>View</b> button can be used to open a page which
shows the selected compounds, or <b>OpenSDF</b> can be used to compile an MDL
SD-file, containing the structures and basic information about the selected
molecules.

<p>For the scaffold sections, note that the portions of the molecules which are
assigned to a scaffold are colored in blue, while the remainder is black. Also,
the scaffold portions of each of the molecules are depicted and aligned in the
same way, while the substituents are arranged according to conventional
aesthetics.

<p>Molecules which are not assigned to any scaffold are shown in the section
which follows the scaffolds. They have no special color coding or 2D
alignment:</p>


<div align="center">
<img src="sar/tabdata2.png" />
</div>

<p>At the bottom of the page are hyperlinks to download any of the SD files
which were generated during the report creation:</p>
