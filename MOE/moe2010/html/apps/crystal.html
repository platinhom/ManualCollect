<h2><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>Crystal cell parameters may be defined in MOE to specify the shape and
dimensions of the crystallographic unit cell, and symmetry-generated siblings as
implied by the space group. </p>

<center><p>
<img src="crystal/crystal.png" alt="Lattice" />
</p></center>

<p>The space group, dimensions and angles are specified in a single panel,
which is illustrated in the above example. When the periodic system is
enabled, the MOE Window displays the unit cell itself, as well as
symmetry-generated cousins (whose positions are dynamically adjusted), and
optionally adjacent unit cells to make up a portion of the lattice.</p>

<h2><a name="Methodology">Methodology</a></h2>

<h4><a name="Unit">Unit Cell</a></h4>

<p>A crystal is an array of atoms packed together in a regular pattern.  A 
<i>unit cell</i> is a piece of the pattern which, when repeated
through space without rotation and without gaps or overlaps, reconstructs the
pattern to infinity.  To fill 3D space without holes, a unit cell must be
a parallelepiped.</p>

<center><img src="crystal/unitcell.gif" alt="Unit Cell" /></center>

<p>The symmetries of a pattern constrain the shape of a unit cell.
There is an infinite number of
possible unit cells for any pattern (e. g. a given unit cell can
generate a family of unit cells by repeated doublings in size). By custom,
the unit cell is chosen to be the smallest one that reveals the special
geometry characteristic of the symmetry.  Thus, although an oblique
parallelepiped can be used for a pattern with 4-fold symmetry, a
cube is preferred.</p>

<p>

When a unit cell is repeatedly translated to fill all of 3D space,
the vertices of all the unit cells in the filled space constitute a
<i>lattice</i>.  A lattice is an infinite array of regularly spaced points.
All points in the lattice have identical "environments" - the view from
every point in the lattice is identical to that from any other point in
the lattice.  The absolute positions of the points of a lattice, and hence
the unit cell, are arbitrary with respect to a pattern.

</p>

<p>Not all lattice points need coincide with unit cell vertices.  
<i>Primitive</i> unit cells use every lattice
point as a unit cell vertex.  <i>Non-primitive</i> unit cells, however,
contain extra lattice points not at the corners.</p>

<p>

A primitive unit cell contains exactly one lattice point.
In a lattice of primitive cells, each lattice point is a vertex shared
among eight cells.  A vertex can thus be thought of as contributing 1/8
of a lattice point to each adjacent cell.  Since each primitive unit cell
touches eight vertices, each contains a total of exactly one lattice point.

</p>

<p>
A non-primitive unit cell has additional lattice points:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><i>end-centered</i> : an extra lattice point is centered in each of
two opposing faces of the cell (with none in the two other pairs of
opposing faces)</li>

  <li><i>face-centered</i> : an extra lattice point is centered in each
face of the cell</li>

  <li><i>body-centered</i> : an extra lattice point is centered in the exact
middle of the cell</li>
</ul>

<p>Although primitive unit cells are simpler than non-primitive unit cells,
the non-primitive unit cell is preferred when its geometry is simpler.
For instance, a rectangular non-primitive cell would be chosen over a
rhomboid primitive cell.  In general, the unit cell used is the smallest
one with the most regular geometry.</p>

<h4><a name="LatticeParameters">Lattice and Unit Cell Parameters</a></h4>

<p>A lattice may be specified by three non-coplanar vectors in 3D.
The vectors lie along the edges of the unit cell and are labeled <i>a</i>,
<i>b</i>, and <i>c</i>.  The magnitude of the vectors is given by the
dimensions of the unit cell in the real crystal under study.

</p>

<p>The faces of the unit cell are labeled as follows:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><i>A</i> : edges defined by lattice vectors <i>b</i> and <i>c</i></li>
  <li><i>B</i> : edges defined by lattice vectors <i>a</i> and <i>c</i></li>
  <li><i>C</i> : edges defined by lattice vectors <i>a</i> and <i>b</i></li>
</ul>

<p>Similarly, the <i>inter-facial angles</i> of the unit cell are defined to be:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <i>alpha</i> : angle between edges <i>b</i> and <i>c</i> </li>
<li> <i>beta</i> : angle between edges <i>a</i> and <i>c</i> </li>
<li> <i>gamma</i> : angle between edges <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> </li>
</ul>

</p></center>

<h4><a name="LatticeSystems">Crystal Lattice Systems: the 14 Bravais
Lattices</a></h4>

<p>Lattices can be classified into "systems," each system being
characterized by the shape of its associated unit cell.  In three
dimensions, the lattices are categorized into seven such systems.  Within
several of these, lattices supporting non-primitive unit cells can be
defined.  The classification scheme yields a total of 14 possible lattices
(called <i>Bravais</i> lattices).  </p>

<p>The lattice symbols used for classification are as follows:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>P : primitive</li>
  <li>B : end-centered on B-face (convention for Monoclinic systems)</li>
  <li>C : end-centered on C-face (convention for Orthorhombic systems)</li>
  <li>I : body-centered (from German <i>innenzentriertes</i>)</li>
  <li>F : face-centered</li>
  <li>R : rhombohedral primitive</li>
</ul>

<p>These symbols also appear in the Hermann-Mauguin
International space group symbols, where they have the same meanings.
For example, group <i>Fmmm</i> is face-centered orthorhombic, and
<i>R3</i> is rhombohedral primitive.</p>

<h2><a name="CrystalParams">Crystal Parameters</a></h2>

<p>To begin working with crystal cells (sometimes referred to as periodic
systems), choose
<b>MOE&nbsp;|&nbsp;Window&nbsp;|&nbsp;Crystal&nbsp;Parameters</b>
or use
<b>Footer&nbsp;|</b>&nbsp;<i>Space&nbsp;Group</i>,
which is
a button labeled by the
space group of the current system (default <tt>P1</tt>).
The following panel appears:</p>

<center><p>
<img src="crystal/crystpar.png" alt="Crystal Parameters" />
</p></center>

<table cellpadding="5" border="0">
<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Space&nbsp;Group</b></td>
<td valign="top">All 230 of the 3D space groups are available, and may be selected
from the option menu. The default is the simplest of all, the triclinic P1 group
which has no symmetry elements and no cell shape constraints. More elaborate
space groups tend to have unit cell angles which are fixed, and symmetry
operations which generate multiple copies of the molecular species within the
unit cell. The label description underneath the option menu describes the system
in slightly more detail. The last part, which reads "1X" in the default case
shown above, indicates how many symmetry-related species are in the unit cell.
In this case it is just one; if the space group were P-1, the number would be 2
due to the center of symmetry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Enable Periodic&nbsp;System</b></td>
<td valign="top">By default this option is off, which means that the periodic box
information entered is not presently displayed or enforced. To see the unit
cell and the symmetry-generated images, enable this option (and press
<b>Apply</b>). Notice that adding, deleting or changing atoms via the usual
methods in MOE cause the unit cell to be updated appropriately.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Cell&nbsp;Size</b></td>
<td valign="top">The dimensions of the unit cell (A, B, C) can be specified, and
these correspond to the X, Y and Z axes in MOE. Only the extents of the axes 
may be specified, not the origins. For most space groups the dimensions may all
be chosen independently; the obvious exceptions are the cubic groups.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Cell&nbsp;Shape</b></td>
<td valign="top">The values of alpha, beta and gamma (angles between
the axes) may be specified for certain space groups, though the degree 
flexibility varies. In triclinic systems all axes may be chosen arbitrarily;
monoclinic systems allow just beta to be modified, whereas orthorhombic and
cubic systems are defined to have all angles equal to 90&deg;.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Coordinates</b></td>
<td valign="top">There are several ways that coordinates can be mapped into the
unit cell. The default (<tt>Normal</tt>) is that no mapping is performed; the
original species is not necessarily within the unit cell at all, though its
symmetry-generated images will still be generated. Selecting <tt>Packed</tt>
ensures that all atoms are packed into the unit cell, and <tt>Molecule</tt>
takes this one step further by locating the center of gravity within the unit
cell and ensuring that all bond lengths are reasonable, which is usually the
most aesthetically pleasing form.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Overlay&nbsp;Packed Coordinates</b></td>
<td valign="top">Ensures that the unit cell will be populated with the appropriate
number of symmetry images, even if the original molecule has coordinates outside
of the unit cell.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Image&nbsp;Style</b></td>
<td valign="top">The original molecular species is the main point of reference,
but its symmetry-generated sibling images are equally valid representations
of the same entity. By modifying the image style, it can be made clear which is
the original. <b>Style</b> has options <tt>Same</tt>, <tt>Line</tt> and
<tt>Hidden</tt>, which are fairly self-explanatory - they apply to the drawing mode
of all copies of the molecule, except the original. Similarly the <b>Label</b>
option allows labels of images to be forcibly hidden. <b>Color</b> defaults to the
same scheme as the original, but can be set to a single color by selecting from
an option menu.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Lattice&nbsp;Style</b></td>
<td valign="top">Just as presentation can be overridden for images generated
within the unit cell, the same can be done for duplicate lattice cells. The
original lattice retains its appearance, but the duplicated neighbors
can be made to take on particular <b>Style</b>/<b>Label</b>/<b>Color</b>
representations.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Lattice</b></td>
<td valign="top">By default only the unit cell is represented visually. The number
of unit cells drawn in each of the three dimensions can be specified by
changing the
numbers in this section. Each number refers to how many unit cells are stacked
along that dimension, hence just the unit cell itself is [1,1,1].
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Inset</b></td>
<td valign="top">By default when there is a lattice drawn composed from multiple
unit cells, the original cell is considered to be on the far edge/vertex. 
Particularly when there are three or more cells drawn in one of the dimensions
it may be
desirable to draw the unit cell further inset. Pressing the <b>1</b> or <b>2</b>
options moves the original cell closer to the other end of the lattice (in all
of the dimensions).
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>OK,&nbsp;Apply</b></td>
<td valign="top">The parameters entered within this panel are not updated
dynamically as they are modified; use the <b>Apply</b> button to update the
MOE window, or <b>OK</b> to update and close.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Build</b></td>
<td valign="top">As unit cell information is entered, the symmetry-generated
species and/or the lattice are actually "ghosts", though they can be visualized
as if real. They will disappear if the Enable Periodic System option is 
deactivated. The <b>Build</b> feature finalizes what is currently seen, and
makes each symmetry image into a new chain.  <b>Note!</b> It is recommended
that Build be used when the Coordinates mode is Molecule; in this way,
individual molecules will have their atoms close together and not be split
across cell boundaries.

<p>Crystal Parameters are stored along with other molecular information in MOE,
