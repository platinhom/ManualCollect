<p>MOE's pharmacophore modeling tools determine the chemical features
and their spatial arrangement in 3D that are essential to the binding
of a ligand to its receptor and thus to the ligand's drug activity.
Pharmacophore models can be generated from
the structural data of protein-ligand complexes as well as from ligands
when no receptor information is available and from the receptor structure
when no ligands are available.  The generated models can be used to screen
virtual compound libraries for potentially active molecules.  </p>

<a name="What_is_a_Pharmacophore?"></a>
<h2>What is a Pharmacophore?</h2>

<p>
The term <i>pharmacophore</i> was coined by Paul Ehrlich
in 1909 to mean
"a molecular framework that carries (<i>phoros</i>) the
essential features responsible for a drug's (<i>pharmacon</i>)
biological activity" [Ehrlich&nbsp;1909].
In other words,
a pharmacophore is a 3D model describing the type and location
of the binding interactions between a ligand and its target receptor.
The IUPAC definition [IUPAC&nbsp;1998] is more precise:
"A pharmacophore is an ensemble of steric and electronic features
that is necessary to ensure the optimal supramolecular interactions
with a specific biological target and to trigger (or
block) its biological response."
The term <i>supramolecular</i> means noncovalent.  Typical
pharmacophoric features include hydrogen bond donor, hydrogen
bond acceptor, hydrophobic, and positively and negatively
ionized areas.
</p>

<img src="ph4_guide/ph4cons_serotonin.png"
class="iconleft"
alt="Consensus Pharmacophore Query" />

<p>
A pharmacophoric feature characterizes a particular property 
and is not tied to a specific chemical structure;
indeed different chemical groups may share the
same property and so be represented by the same feature.
It is thus a mistake to name as pharmacophoric features chemical
functionalities such as guanidines or sulfonamides or
typical structural skeletons such as flavones or steroids
[IUPAC&nbsp;1998].
</p>

<p>The term <i>pharmacophore modeling</i> refers to the generation of
a pharmacophore hypothesis for the binding interactions in a
particular active site.  
Several different pharmacophore models for the same active site
can be overlaid and reduced to their shared features
so that common interactions are retained.
Such a <i>consensus pharmacophore</i>
can be considered as "the largest common denominator shared by a set
of active molecules" [IUPAC 1998].
</p>

<img src="ph4_guide/ann_serotonin.png"
class="floatright"
alt="Pharmacophore Query Definition: Annotations" />

<p>In MOE, the computerized representation of a hypothesized pharmacophore
is called a <i>pharmacophore query</i>.
A MOE pharmacophore query is a set of
<i>query features</i> that are typically created from
ligand <i>annotation points</i>.
<a href="#Phamacophore_Annotations">Annotation points</a>
(automatically detected
in MOE) are markers in space that show the location and type of
biologically important atoms and groups, such as hydrogen donors
and acceptors, aromatic centers, projected positions of possible
interaction partners or R-groups, charged groups, and bio-isosteres.
The annotation points on a ligand are the potential locations of
the features that will constitute the pharmacophore query.
Annotation points relevant to the pharmacophore are converted into
query features with the addition of an extra parameter: a non-zero
radius that encodes the permissible variation in the pharmacophore query's
geometry.
</p>

<p>
Once generated, a
pharmacophore query can be used
to screen virtual compound libraries for novel ligands.
Pharmacophore queries can also be used to filter conformer databases,
e.g. output from molecular docking runs, for biologically active
conformations.

    </p>

<a name="Introduction_to_Pharmacophore_Modeling"></a>
<h2>Introduction to Pharmacophore Modeling and Searching</h2>

<p>
In MOE, creating a pharmacophore model or <i>query</i>
involves a number of steps:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Prepare the data.</li>
<li>Generate pharmacophore annotation points.</li>
<li>Select features to include in the pharmacophore query.</li>
<li>Refine the query.</li>
</ol>

<a name="Preparing_the_Data"></a>
<h3>Preparing the Data</h3>

<p>
The kind of preparatory steps needed depends on what data are
available.  For example, since a
pharmacophore model ought to be representative throughout the
3D conformational space occupied by a set of ligands,
in ligand-based query generation, a set of
<a href="confgui.htm">input conformations</a> must be
generated if they are not already available.
Furthermore, for subsequent annotation using the
automatic annotation services of the Pharmacophore Query Editor,
these conformations must represent "exact"
(i.e. <a href="../mdb/wash.htm">washed</a>) structures.
For example,
carboxylate is considered structurally distinct from carboxylic
acid: no implicit tautomer transformations are performed.
<i>Molecules are annotated as-presented.</i>
If exact structures are not already available,
they must be generated too.
</p>

<center>
<table border="0" width="50%">

</td>
<td>
<center>
<img src="ph4_guide/acetic_acid.png" alt="Acetic acid" />
<br />
Acetic acid
</center>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>In complex-based query generation, should the crystallized complex
be available, ligand conformation is no longer an issue as the
structure contains the ligand in its bound form.  This simplifies
the task of determining a pharmacophore for the target and minimal
data preparation is necessary.
</p>

<p>In target-based query generation, exploratory investigation
of the receptor is needed to locate binding cavities and
identify within them where and what kind of
important interactions take place.
This kind of investigation can also used in the query refinement
step.

</p>

<a name="Pharmacophore_Annotations"></a>
<h3>Pharmacophore Annotations</h3>

<p>
Annotation is the process of identifying regions of
pharmacophoric importance in space
around a molecular conformation and associating with those regions
pharmacophore types.
In MOE, the 
<a href="ph4_query.htm">Pharmacophore Query Editor</a> 
both annotates the molecular system currently loaded in MOE
as well as renders the resulting annotations graphically in the MOE Window.
</p>

<p>
Locating and assigning pharmacophore annotations can be done
in different ways.
Although MOE provides a variety of built-in
<a href="ph4_annot.htm"><i>pharmacophore annotation schemes</i></a>
or simply <i>schemes</i>, each of which has its own
particular set of annotation types,
the default <b>Unified</b> scheme is to be preferred as it
is comprehensive, providing the annotation types of all
the other schemes without loss of efficiency.
</p>

<p>
Once assigned, annotations can be turned into features using
the Pharmacophore Query Editor.  Note, however, that it is not a
requirement that a feature be created from an annotation.
Features can be created, positioned, and assigned pharmacophoric
types within the Pharmacophore Query Editor independent of
annotations, although it is rarely necessary to do so.
Annotations thus serve as <i>suggestions</i> for
which type of features to use and where they should be located.
In almost all cases, features are created from annotation points.
</p>

<!-- ================== START More About Annotation Points ================= -->

<div class="extra_info">
<a name="About_Annotation_Points"></a>
<h3>About Annotation Points</h3>

<p>Annotation points can be broadly divided into three categories:
<i>atom</i>, <i>projected</i>, and <i>centroid</i>,
the latter including bioisosteres.
A special fourth class of annotations, <i>links</i>, denotes
points of substitution on candidate scaffold molecules
and potential R-group substituents, and is designed
to assist in scaffold replacement or mimetic projects.

<p>When the panel opens, the ligand is automatically annotated.
By default, a wide variety of the calculated annotations are rendered
in the MOE Window.
For the purposes of the present example,
the annotation types of interest are:

    <blockquote>

<br clear="both" />

<div class="floatright">
<img src="ph4_guide/ph4_query_panel_create_feature.png"
alt="Pharmacophore Query Panel Feature List" />
</div>

<p>A feature can be added to a pharmacophore query by selecting one
or more corresponding annotation points in the MOE Window and then
pressing the <b>Create:&nbsp;Feature</b> button in the Pharmacophore
Query Editor panel.  The newly created feature appears in the panel
list area, which displays each feature's automatically-generated
name and an associated expression that describes the feature.
To the right of the feature list are buttons for deleting
features from the query and for changing their position in the list
(for purposes of better visualization).
</p>

<p>Each feature in the query has:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>A location in space, which can be modified directly in the
MOE Window in the same way as that of an atom: by selecting the feature
(either in the panel or in the MOE Window) and then using
<tt>Shift</tt>-<tt>Alt</tt>-drag middle;
    </li>
    <li>A radius, which is controlled by the value of <b>R</b>
in the panel; and
    </li>
    <li>A logical expression called a <i>feature expression</i>
that may include both annotation point types and
<a href="../moe/molsystems/smiles.html#SMARTS">SMARTS</a>
strings.  A feature inherits its types from its generating
annotation points.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Once completed, a pharmacophore query can be saved to a MOE pharmacophore
file for future use by pressing <b>Save</b> in
the Pharmacophore Query Editor.  The default extension is <tt>.ph4</tt>.
This file can subsequently be edited with
the Pharmacophore Query Editor or used by other applications

<a name="Automatic_Query_Generation"></a>
<h3>Automatic Query Generation</h3>

<p>When multiple ligands are available (and assuming they bind
in similar ways to the receptor), it is possible to automate
at least parts of the query generation process.
Pharmacophore Consensus can be used to suggest features that are
common to many of the actives, and is an aid to manual
query generation.  Pharmacophore Elucidator generates and
scores pharmacophore queries for a set of aligned molecules,
and little or no manual intervention is required.
Both applications require molecular conformations.
</p>

<a name="Consensus_Features"></a>
<h4>Consensus Features</h4>

<p>
The <a href="ph4_query.htm#RunningConsensus">Pharmacophore Consensus</a>
application
calculates a set of <i>consensus features</i> from the
aggregate annotation points of a set of
<a href="flex.htm">aligned molecules</a>.
The features are scored based on the number of molecule in which
they appear, and are easily included in a
pharmacophore query.  The molecular conformations must have been
precalculated and aligned and loaded into MOE.

</p>

<p>

</tr>
</table>
</center>
</p>

<p>The Pharmacophore Consensus
panel is opened from the Pharmacophore Query Editor
by pressing <b>Consensus</b> (at top right).
Once the suggested features have been calculated (by pressing
<b>Calculate</b> in the Pharmacophore Consensus panel),
they can be transferred to the invoking
Pharmacophore Query Editor by selecting them
in the <b>Suggested Features</b> list and pressing <b>Load Selected</b>.
The selected features will be appended to

<a name="Elucidator"></a>
<h4>Pharmacophore Elucidator</h4>

<p>The Pharmacophore Elucidator exhaustively generates pharmacophore
queries for a set of

and scores them based on a combined measure of
how well they overlay the ligands and
how well they classify the data set into actives and inactives.

<p>
Molecular conformations can be either read in
or calculated at runtime by choosing one of the conformation
generation methods from the <b>Conformations</b> option menu
(<b>As-Is</b> implies that the conformations have been precalculated).
</p>

<p>To run the application, an <b>Output Database</b> name must be
supplied.  The <b>Active Coverage</b> (which is the number of active
molecules represented by the given query) and <b>Feature Limit</b>
(maximum number of pharmacophore features) parameters can be adjusted
based on the amount and type of data available.
<b>Query Spacing</b> and <b>Query Cluster</b> are resolution tuning
parameters used to determine when a query is considered to be
representative of a molecule and when two queries are considered
to be the same.  Only different queries that satisfy the Active
Coverage and Feature Limit parameters are output.

<a name="Performing_a_Pharmacophore_Search"></a>
<h3>Performing a Pharmacophore Search</h3>

<p>Pharmacophore searching in MOE is performed using the
Pharmacophore Search application.  There are two ways
to invoke Pharmacophore Search:

<ul>
    <li>In the Pharmacophore Query Editor panel, press <b>Search</b>.</li>
    <li>In a MOE Database Viewer, select
	<b>DBV&nbsp;|&nbsp;File&nbsp;|&nbsp;Pharmacophore&nbsp;Search</b>.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>When invoked from a Pharmacophore Query Editor, the query currently
open in the Editor is used for the search.  This launch point is convenient
when the query is undergoing iterative refinement,
and search results are
being examined after each modification step to evaluate the changes being made.
A Pharmacophore Search panel launched
from a Pharmacophore Query Editor automatically uses the latest version of
the pharmacophore query for its search.
The databases to be searched are supplied when <b>Search</b> is pressed,
and can be modified from within the Pharmacophore Search panel
using the <b>Input</b> controls.
</p>

<p>If Pharmacophore Search is invoked from a Database Viewer, a
pharmacophore query must be specified in the Pharmacophore Search panel
using the <b>Query:&nbsp;Browse</b> button.  A Pharmacophore Query Editor
can also be opened from the Pharmacophore Search panel using
<b>Query:&nbsp;Edit</b> to edit the
query currently being used by the Search panel.
</p>

<p>
<center>
<img src="ph4_guide/ph4_search_panel.png" alt="Pharmacophore Search Panel" />
</center>
</p>

<p>In general, the bound conformations of the ligands being searched
are not known.  A conformational search must be performed on the
candidate molecules prior to initiating the search
(or existent conformational databases used);
the pharmacophore search is then applied
to those conformations.  The search
proceeds by annotating each candidate ligand conformation and
then attempting to match the annotations to the constraints
of the pharmacophore query such that all restrictions of the
query are satisfied.  There can be more than one way in which
a candidate conformation can match a query.
</p>

<p>Successful matches (<i>hits</i>) can be written to an output
database using the <b>Output</b> options; they can also be selected
or isolated in the input Database Viewer using the
<b>Hit Entries</b> menu.

<!-- ==================== END HIV1-PR Search =================== -->

<a name="Refining_the_Query"></a>
<h3>Refining the Query</h3>

<p>Pharmacophore queries can be improved by an iterative cycle
of refinement and validation.  The goal is a query with
a high true positive rate and low false positive and
false negative rate.
A simple pharmacophore query, for example the one
presented in the HIV-1 PR example, might use only ligand
information.  If the receptor structure is available,
knowledge of the binding pocket can be used to enhance
the query with steric and other structural constraints.
</p>

<p>
Some strategies for refining pharmacophore queries include:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
<p>
<b>Using constraints.</b> MOE pharmacophore queries can
be enhanced with a variety of constraints.  These can be
used, for example, to characterize the structure or
other properties of the binding pocket.

   <ul>
   <li><i>Volumes.</i> Volume filters help avoid clashes
	with the receptor and confine hits to limited
	spatial regions.
   </li>
   <li><i>Logic constraints and SMARTS expressions.</i>
	Explicit descriptions of permitted types and
	chemical environments can be associated with
	both features and volumes.
    </li>
    <li><i>Partial Matching and Essential Features.</i>
	Both optional and required features can be specified.
    </li>
    </ul>

</li>

<li>
<p>
<b>Adding / deleting features and volumes.</b> Larger numbers of
features may reduce the hit rate but increase specificity.
</li>

<li>
<p>
<b>Determining features from pocket analysis.</b>
Examination of the binding pocket, for example in terms of
electrostatics and preferred contacts, can reveal potentially
important pharmacophoric features.
</li>

<li>
<p>
<b>Adjusting feature radius and position.</b>
Custom fine-tuning can improve performance.  Note that
features are normalized with respect to feature size (radius)
so that large radius features (i.e. features
with higher positional tolerance) are not given more importance
than small radius ones.
</li>

</ul>

<p>When further refinement of a pharmacophore query using
explicit 3D constraints yields little gain, 2D modeling
approaches in MOE can be used to refine the pharmacophore
search results.  For example, a
<a href="../quasar/model.htm">binary QSAR</a>
filter could be used to pre- or post-process the hit list.
</p>

<p>
<ul class="help">
<li class="help">
Please refer to the <a href="../tutorials/ph4_tut.htm#Tuning">Pharmacophore
Tutorial</a> for an example of how to refine a query
using interactive tuning and directional features.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<!-- ================== START More About Constraints ================= -->

<div class="extra_info">
<a name="About_Constraints"></a>
<h3>About Constraints</h3>

MOE pharmacophore queries can be
refined with a number of different constraints:

<dl>

<dt><p><b>Volume and Shape Filters</b></dt>
<dd>Volume constraints are spatial constraints imposed
on particular atoms.  These constraints
serve both to
confine hits to spatial regions in which steric clashes
with the receptor are avoided as well as to ensure that
favorable contact regions will be populated with
appropriate atoms.

<p>Each volume constraint, analogously to features, has an
associated <i>volume expression</i>.  The
volume expression is a
<a href="../moe/molsystems/smiles.html#SMARTS">SMARTS</a>
string.  The empty string (i.e. if no expression is
specified) is equivalent to <tt>[#Q]</tt>, which
means &quot;any heavy atom&quot;.  The volume constraint
places restrictions only
on atoms that match the volume expression.
</p>

<p>
There are three types of volume constraint:
</p>

    <p>
    <table border="0">
	<tr>
	<td><img src="ph4_guide/excluded_volume.png"></td>
	<td><i>Excluded volume.</i> No atoms matching the
	    volume expression are permitted inside the
	    volume (useful for modeling receptor shape).
	    The volume delimits the region of space that
	    may not be occupied by the prescribed atoms.
	</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td><img src="ph4_guide/exterior_volume.png"></td>
	<td><i>Exterior volume.</i> No atoms matching the
	volume expression are permitted outside the
	volume (useful for modeling ligand shape).
	The volume delimits the region of space (the <i>exterior</i>
	boundary) that may be occupied
	by the prescribed atoms.
	</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td><img src="ph4_guide/included_volume.png"></td>
	<td><i>Included volume.</i> At least one atom specified by
	the volume expression must be located inside the volume.
	</td>
	</tr>
    </table>
    </p>

    <p>
    The volume constraint is specified as one or more spheres where
    each sphere is centered on a selected atom.
    </p>

    <p><span class="tip">Tip</span> Volume constraints are evaluated
    on atom centers, i.e the atoms are considered to be points having
    zero radii.  As a consequence, there still may be clashes between the hit
    molecules and the pharmacophore volumes.
    It is advisable therefore to take into account the van der Waals radii of
    candidate ligand atoms by calculating the
    <a href="surfmap.htm">Interaction (VDW) surface</a> and
    adjusting (increasing, if excluded volume, decreasing otherwise) the
    radii of the volume constraints so that they just penetrate the
    interaction surface.  To allow for some tolerance, relax
    (decrease if excluded volume, increase otherwise)
    this radius by 0.3-0.5&Aring;.
    </p>

</dd>

<dt><p><b>Feature Expressions</b></dt>
<dd>These are logical constraints that
    can be added to both features and volumes, e.g.
    <span class="nobr"><tt>Don &amp; Acc</tt></span>
    and can help focus the query toward a specific property.
</dd>

<dt><p><b>SMARTS Matches</b></dt>
<dd>The chemistry of a group (substructure) to be matched
    can be specified within a feature expression using
    <a href="../moe/molsystems/smiles.html">SMARTS</a> strings,
    e.g. <span class="nobr"><tt>Don &amp; Acc ! &quot;[N]&quot;</tt></span>
</dd>
</tr>

<dt><p><b>Partial Matches</b></dt>
<dd>Allowing partial matches permits optional features
    to be included and can make the query less specific.
</dd>

<dt><p><b>Essential Features</b></dt>
<dd>Features marked essential to
    the query must always be matched, even when partial matching
    is enabled.
</dd>

<dt><p><b>Group Constraints</b></dt>
<dd>These specify that a certain
    number of the specified features must be matched.
    This kind of constraint may be useful for
    accounting for alternative feature locations, e.g.
    to allow for sidechain flexibility.
</dd>

<i>Protonate the system.</i>
<br />
For accurate drawing of surface interaction maps and of creation of
volume constraints, explicit atoms are required.  Currently,
the system is in hydrogen-suppressed mode.  The system can be
protonated using

<blockquote>
<span class="nobr"><b>MOE | Compute | Protonate 3D</b></span>
</blockquote>

<p>
In general, explicit hydrogen atoms are required for all-atom
molecular mechanics, dynamics, and electrostatic calculations.
The <a href="protonate3d.htm">Protonate 3D</a>
application assigns ionization states and calculates
hydrogen positions in a macromolecular structure.
</p>


<p>In the Protonate 3D panel, press <b>OK</b>.  The calculation
may take a few moments to complete; progress is reported in the
MOE Window.

The <a href="surfmap.htm#ElectrostaticFeatures">electrostatic maps</a>
of the 1HPV pocket predict where hydrophobic,
hydrogen bond acceptor and hydrogen bond donor contacts are preferred.
Partial charges must be assigned to the system before the calculation

<p>The calculation solves the Poisson-Boltzmann equation for the
electrostatic potential, which is then used to generate the

<h3>Validating the Query</h3>

<p>Once a pharmacophore query has been refined, it can be evaluated
by performing a pharmacophore search.  If the results of this search are
found to be unsatisfactory, another round of
query refinement can be done.  In this way, the pharmacophore
query can be iteratively improved.

it can be seen that the hits

</p>

<li>
<p>
Experiments using partial matches can be made.
However, since
the presence of the projected acceptor feature <i>Acc2</i>
prevents hits that displace the bound water,
the <i>Acc2</i> feature should probably be made essential
when partial matches are enabled.  To make a feature essential,
turn on its
<b>F:Essential</b> attribute in the Pharmacophore Query Editor.

<a name="Automatic_Pharmacophore_Query_Generation"></a>
<h3>Automatic Pharmacophore Query Generation</h3>

<p>Pharmacophore queries can be manually generated, edited,
and customized using the Pharmacophore Query Editor.
In addition, there are
various tools in MOE for generating pharmacophore queries
automatically:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><p>
	<a href="ph4_query.htm#Running_Pharmacophore_Consensus">Pharmacophore Consensus</a>.
	Obtain consensus features from aligned ligands.
	</p>

	<p>
	The Pharmacophore Consensus panel is opened from the Pharmacophore
	Query Editor.  It calculates consensus features from
	a set of aligned molecules loaded in MOE or found in a database.
	Ligand alignment can be achieved using MOE's
	<a href="flex.htm">Flexible Alignment</a> application.
	The suggested features can be loaded back into the Pharmacophore
	Query Editor.
	</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
	<a href="ph4_elu.htm">Pharmacophore Elucidation</a>.
	Automatically determine a pharmacophore query from active
	(and optionally inactive) ligands.
	</p>

	<p>
	The pharmacophore query is elucidated without knowledge of
	the receptor.
	It is assumed, however, that the ligands bind to the receptor
	in the same
	mode, i.e. they overlay well, and that the collection of ligands
	is sufficiently diverse so that important pharmacophoric features
	will emerge.  The elucidator operates on 3D conformations; these
	can be generated automatically by the application if not provided.
	</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
	<a href="plif.htm#Query_Generator">PLIF</a>. Generate a pharmacophore
	query from a consensus of Protein Ligand Interaction Fingerprints.
	</p>

	<p>
	The PLIF application uses fingerprints to encode interactions
	such as hydrogen bonds, ionic interactions, and
	surface contacts between ligands and
	proteins.  The application operates either
	on a database of complexed ligand-proteins (e.g. a collection
	of crystal structures) or on a receptor
	loaded in MOE and a database of ligands in their bound conformations
	(e.g. the results of rigid-receptor docking).
	Since the fingerprints encode structural information, a set of
	consensus pharmacophore features
	can be derived from a consensus of interaction fingerprints.
	In order to be meaningful, the ligand binding modes
	should be similar, i.e. the bits in the interaction fingerprint
	which are important to activity should be highly conserved
	across all fingerprints being used to generate the
	pharmacophore features.
	</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<a name="Running_in_MOE/batch"></a>
<h2>Running in MOE/batch</h2>

<p>
Pharmacophore query generation in general requires user interaction
and is not well-suited for batch mode.  Pharmacophore search, on the
other hand, can be done in MOE/batch using an SVL
<a href="../tutorials/svltour.html#Scripts">script</a>
or
<a href="../tutorials/svltour.html#Executable_Programs">runnable file</a>
that invokes the SVL function
<a class="svl" href="../moe/fcnref/ph4srch.htm">ph4_Search</a>.
In the following, we show how to use a script to run
pharmacophore search as a batch job.
</p>

<p>
An SVL script is a sequence of SVL expressions stored in a plain text file.
The expressions are executed as though they had been entered at the SVL
<a href="../moe/hellomoe.htm#Command_Line_Interface_(CLI)">CLI</a>
(Command Line Interface), except that in a script each expression
must be terminated by a semi-colon (;).
</p>

<p>Here is an example of a one-line script for performing a pharmacophore search
on the database <tt>dbfile.mdb</tt>
using the pharmacophore query file <tt>query.ph4</tt>:
</p>

<pre>
    ph4_Search ['dbfile.mdb', 'query.ph4'];
</pre>

<p>The above call assumes that <tt>dbfile.mdb</tt> contains
a pre-calculated molecule index field called <tt>mseq</tt> (molecule sequence
number).
</p>

<p>Here is an example of a more complicated invocation, using
some of the possible <tt>ph4_Search</tt> options.
These lines would be the exact contents of the script file:

<pre>
    ph4_Search [
	'dbfile.mdb',
	'query.ph4',
	[
	    molfield: 'ligand2',	// input molecule field name
	    maxmolhits: 5000,		// max # hits to generate per entry
	    use_mseqfield: 0,		// don't use the mseq field
	    out_dbfile:'srch_out.mdb',	// output database file name
	    out_append: 0		// overwrite output database file
	]
    ];
</pre>

<p>Supposing one of the above calling sequences is saved to the file
<tt>'ph4search.svl'</tt>.  The search
can then be executed in MOE/batch using the following
in a command shell (Unix) or in a command prompt window
(Windows):
</p>

<pre>
    % moebatch -script ph4search.svl
</pre>

<p>This command invokes <tt>moebatch</tt> to run the script and
then terminate once the script has finished executing.
</p>

<p>Using
<a class="svl" href="../svl/fcnref/print.html">print</a> and
<a class="svl" href="../svl/fcnref/freadetc.html">write</a> statements
in the script file
allows additional information to be reported to the shell:
</p>

<pre>
    ph4_Search ['dbfile.mdb', 'query.ph4'];
    write ['\nDone.  {}\n\n', asctime []];
</pre>

<p>
will, on completion of the search, print a message similar to this:
</p>

<pre>
    Done. Thu Dec 18 12:45:30 2008
</pre>
