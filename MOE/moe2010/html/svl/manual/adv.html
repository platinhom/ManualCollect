<h2><a name="Functions with Fewer than Specified Number of Arguments">Functions with Fewer
than Specified Number of Arguments</a></h2>

<p>When functions are called with fewer than the number of expected
arguments, the shortfall is made up with nulls. In some cases, null
arguments make perfect sense; in other cases, such as with <tt>div</tt> or
<tt>get</tt>, they generate errors. Many functions merely return null when
presented with a null argument.</p>

<h3><a name="Binary Operators with Null or Unit Arguments">
	    Binary Operators with Null or Unit Arguments</a></h3>

Reduction is not well defined for unit or null
arguments. Some binary operators cannot be called with fewer than two
arguments. Others may behave quite sensibly. Consider, for instance, the
arithmetic operations <tt>add</tt> and <tt>mul</tt>.  By definition,
<tt>add v</tt> computes: 

<p align="center">
<img SRC="adv/Image86.gif" WIDTH="52" HEIGHT="46">
</center></p>

<p>When <tt>v</tt> is <tt>null</tt>, the sum sums to the additive
identity, 0. Similarly, we have for <tt>mul</tt>, 

<p><center>
<img SRC="adv/Image87.gif" WIDTH="69" HEIGHT="30"> 
</p></center>

<p><tt>andE</tt> is another example of well-defined behavior. The following is
necessarily true: </p>

<pre>
    (andE cat [a,b]) === (andE a and andE b)
</pre>

<p>If <tt>b</tt> is null, then <tt>andE b</tt> must evaluate to
<tt>1</tt>, which determines the behavior of <tt>andE</tt> with a null
argument. Similar reasoning may be applied to <tt>orE</tt>.</p>

<h2><a name="Tasks">Tasks</a></h2>

<p>SVL tasks can be created for executing individual functions and
scripts, or for evaluating expressions. Tasks can also be created using
forking routines. Task forking is needed, for example, when implementing
monitoring routines or when running a task that must not fail but is
required to perform operations that might.</p>

<p>Tasks have associated environment variables which may be queried and set.</p>

<h2><a name="Performance Issues">Performance Issues</a></h2>

<h4><a name="Integer Arithmetic">Integer Arithmetic</a></h4>

<p>Integer arithmetic (<tt>iadd</tt>, <tt>isub</tt>, <tt>imul</tt>) should
only be used when space and memory are at a premium, and when the data are
known to be integer (for instance, when the data are vector indices).
Floating point arguments will be rounded before calculations are done.
There is no integer divide.</p>

<p>For more on numbers, see <a href="svlfund.html">Numeric Data</a>.

<h4><a name="Cost of Function Calls">Cost of Function Calls</a></h4>

<p>Each function call has a significant overhead associated with it, in
addition to its computing time. Thus, when the vectors to be manipulated
are relatively short in length, it is the calling overhead which dominates
the running time, whereas when the vectors are long, it is the actual
computing time which dominates. So, if your vectors are short, it is
particularly important to minimize the number of function calls so as to
minimize the overhead. However, keeping the number of calls to a minimum
is generally a good rule of thumb no matter what the length of the
vector.</p>

<h4><a name="Memory Allocation and Performance">Memory Allocation and Performance</a></h4>

<p>Memory considerations become significant when handling large amounts of
data. However, the limitations of memory capacity can be felt even when
not manipulating long vectors. In general, memory requirements scale
proportionally with the amount of parallelization achieved. This is
because parallel processing distributes work over memory so that the
product of the parallel running time and the amount of memory consumed are
equal to the work complexity (sequential runtime). There is thus a
tradeoff between speed and memory.  This suggests that unless you have a
very large amount of memory indeed, you should not try to turn an
<tt>0(n<sup>3</sup>)</tt>algorithm into one that is <tt>0(LOG n)</tt>.</p>

<p>When vectors are so large that computational memory requirements exceed
the capacity of the machine on which the computations are being run,
one-line computations must be divided up over several lines of code. For
example, in matrix multiplication, a loop could be used to step through
each column or row of one of the matrices. Although in this manual we have
frequently admonished against using loops for stepping through data in
precisely this manner, this is an example of a case in which the use of a
loop is justified. </p>

<pre>
    for i = 1, length m1 loop 
	m(i) = add ( m1(i) * m2 );
    endloop
</pre>

<p>This computation requires a chunk of memory whose size is the dimension of <tt>m1(i)</tt>
times the dimensions of <tt>m2</tt>.</p>

<p>In SVL, for purposes of thrift, memory allocation is delayed until absolutely necessary
(this optimization has not yet been fully implemented); for example, copying a vector does
not perform any allocation. Thus, </p>

<pre>
    a = igen 20;
    b = a; 
</pre>

<p>results in both <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt> pointing to the same
location. As soon as any modification is done on a vector that is pointed
to by more than one variable, new memory is allocated. (Although for now,
some allocations are still performed even when memory is uniquely
associated with one variable.)</p>

<b>

<p>Note:</b> This only applies to local vectors. Global vectors are always copied before
modification.</p>

<h4><a name="Code Speed-Ups">Code Speed-Ups</a></h4>

<p>Here are some rules of thumb to use when coding in SVL for speed: 

<ul>
  <li>Use <tt>loop</tt> constructs when the complexity of calculation or
  of memory use warrants it. Otherwise use <tt>app</tt> or <tt>apt</tt>.</li>

  <tt><li>app</tt> and <tt>apt</tt> are faster than <tt>loop</tt>, but still
  costly; keep use of these to a minimum.</li>

  <tt><li>tr</tt> is a costly operation. In general, one use of <tt>tr</tt>
  leads to another. If too many <tt>tr</tt> calls abound, you may be using
  an inefficient vector structure in your calculations. Note that
  <tt>tr</tt> is part of the <tt>apt</tt> operation.</li>

  <li>It is faster to operate on flat vectors. In other words, avoid
  deeply nested vectors.</li>

  <li>It is faster to operate on long vectors. However, extremely long
  vectors may be more efficient if processed in a loop in chunks.</li> 
</ul>
