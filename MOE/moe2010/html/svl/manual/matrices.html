<p>Although it might be assumed that a vector language is ill suited for
matrix manipulations, matrix operations in SVL are in fact relatively
straightforward. This is because in SVL, a matrix is merely a vector with
vector elements. In this chapter, we will discuss primarily 2-D matrices,
with a short discussion at the end of how to extend to higher
dimensions.</p>


<h2><a name="Representing Matrices">Representing Matrices</a></h2>

<p>In SVL, a 2-D matrix: </p>

<pre>
    a b c d
    e f g h
    i j k l 
</pre>

<p>is best represented as a vector of <i>rows</i>: </p>

<pre>
    M = [ [a,b,c,d],
          [e,f,g,h],
          [i,j,k,l] ]; 
</pre>

<p>In this way, <tt>M</tt>, an <i>r</i> x <i>c</i> matrix, has <i>r</i>
(number of rows) elements, each of which is of length <i>c</i>, the number
of columns. Row <tt>i</tt> can then be extracted from the matrix using
<tt>M(i)</tt>.</p>

<p>A column <tt>j</tt> can easily be extracted from <tt>M</tt> by flipping
the matrix into a column-wise representation using the transpose operator
<tt>tr</tt>; this is effectively accomplished using <tt>apt</tt>, as
follows: </p>

<pre>
    apt peek [M,1] 
</pre>

<p>To extract a single element from <tt>M</tt>, use double indexing:
<tt>M(i)(j)</tt>.  retrieves the <tt>j</tt>th column of the <tt>i</tt>th
row from a row-wise matrix.</p>

<h3><a name="Identity Matrix">Identity Matrix</a></h3>

<p>The identity matrix of dimension <tt>n</tt> is generated by the
following line of code:  </p>

<pre>
    I = igen n == [igen n]; 
</pre>

<p>Here, <tt>I</tt> is in both row-wise and column-wise representation (since <tt>I </tt>is
symmetric).</p>

<p>A matrix of all zeroes can be generated from <tt>I</tt> with:</p>

<pre>
    zero I;
</pre>

<p>as can, similarly, a matrix of all ones with:</p>

<pre>
    one I;
</pre>

<p>These can also be generated using <tt>rep</tt>, for instance, for a matrix of zeroes: </p>

<pre>
    Z = rep [ rep[0,n], n ]; 
</pre>

<h2><a name="Basic Matrix Operations">Basic Matrix Operations</a></h2>

<p>Matrices can be added and subtracted in the same way vectors can. For
instance, to add matrices <tt>A</tt> and <tt>B</tt>, use </p>

<pre>
    A + B 
</pre>

<p>Multiplication by a vector (a one-dimensional matrix) and by a matrix
are achieved with identical lines of code. In the following, for
matrix-matrix multiplication, both matrices <tt>M</tt> and <tt>m</tt> are
represented row-wise, and the operation returns a row-wise matrix. As
always, the number of columns in <tt>M</tt> and the number of rows in
<tt>m</tt> must match. </p>

<pre>
    Mm = app add (M * [m]); 
</pre>

<p>For matrix-vector multiplication,: </p>

<pre>
    Mv = app add (M * [v]); 
</pre>

<p>and the length of <tt>v</tt> must equal the number of columns in
<tt>M</tt>. <tt>v</tt> must be given as an <i>n </i><tt> </tt>1
<i>column</i> vector in row-wise representation, i.e. as
<tt>[</tt><i>v</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>v</i><sub>2</sub>, ...  ,
<i>v</i><sub>n</sub><tt>]</tt>. The returned value is a <i>k</i> <tt>
</tt>1 vector, where k is the number of rows in <tt>M</tt>.</p>

<p>Vector-matrix (<tt>v*M</tt>) multiplication requires that the
multiplying vector be a 1<tt></tt> n <i>row</i> vector in given row-wise
representation, i.e. <tt>[</tt> <tt>[</tt><i>v</i><sub>1</sub>,
<i>v</i><sub>2</sub>, ... , <i>v</i><sub>n</sub><tt>] ]</tt>, in which
case </p>

<pre>
    vM = app add (v * [M]); 
</pre>

<p>Note that the return value is a 1<tt></tt> <i>k</i> vector, where
<i>k</i> is the number of columns in <tt>M</tt>.</p>

<p>For a <i>column</i> vector <tt>v</tt>, vector-matrix multiplication can
also be achieved, without first transposing <tt>v</tt> into a row vector,
with the following: </p>

<pre>
    vM = add (v * M) 
</pre>

<p>This returns a <i>column</i> vector. Vector-vector multiplication
(inner product) can be calculated with the following: </p>

<pre>
    viw = add (v * w) 
</pre>

<p>In each of these, the vectors must be column vectors, i.e.
of the form <tt>[</tt><i>v</i><sub>1</sub>,
<i>v</i><sub>2</sub>, ... , <i>v</i><sub>n</sub><tt>].</p>
</tt>

<p>The outer product of vectors is accomplished using (for column vectors
<tt>v</tt> and <tt>w</tt>):  </p>

<pre>
    vow = v * [w] 
</pre>

<p>which is equivalent to <tt>v * tr w</tt>.</p>

<p>The vector cross product for 3 vectors can be calculated as (for column
vectors <tt>v</tt> and <tt>w</tt>): </p>

<pre>
    vxw = rotl v * rotr w - rotr v * rotl w ; 
</pre>

<p>This is the operation performed by the built-in function
<tt>rot3d_vCross</tt>.</p>

<p>Matrix transposition is achieved with the <tt>tr </tt>operator, which
turns rows into columns and columns into rows. </p>

<pre>
    svl&gt; M = [ [1,2,3], [4,5,6] ] 
    svl&gt; tr M
    [ [1,4], [2,5], [3,6] ]
</pre>
<b>

<p>Caution!</b> Attempting large matrix multiplications may cause your
system to slow significantly.</p>

<h2><a name="Higher-Dimensional Matrices">Higher-Dimensional Matrices</a></h2>

<p>Representation of higher-dimensional matrices can be accomplished in
the same way as for 2-D matrices, with an additional level of nesting. For
instance, a 3-D matrix could be manipulated as a vector of 2-D matrices,
thus: </p>

<pre>
    M3D = [ M1, M2, M3 ]
</pre>

<p>where each of the <tt>M</tt>_i is a 2-D matrix.</p>

<p>Extending from the 2-D case, extracting the 2-D matrix <tt>Mi</tt> from
<tt>M3D, </tt>is done with <tt>M3D(i)</tt>. Extracting row <tt>j</tt> of
<tt>Mi</tt> is done with <tt>M3D(i)(j)</tt>, and extracting the element in
column <tt>k</tt>, with <tt>M3D(i)(j)(k)</tt>.</p>

<p>Addition and subtraction are performed in the same manner as in the 2-D
case. </p>

<h2><a name="BuiltInFunctions">Built-in Functions</a></h2>

<p>Several predefined functions are available for routine  <a
href="../fcnref/matlib.htm">matrix operations</a>, which include <tt>matid</tt>
and <tt>matmul</tt>, which can improve source code readability, as well as
advanced operations such as diagonalization and inversion.
