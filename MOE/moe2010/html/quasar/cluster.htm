<h2>Formulation and Theory</h2>

<p>The purpose of QuaSAR-Cluster is three-fold: 

<ol>
<li>
<i>Clustering</i>. When designing experiments it is often necessary that
a &quot;diverse&quot; collection of molecules be used (in order to avoid bias).
QuaSAR-Cluster can assign codes to a collection of molecules, based upon a
table of molecular descriptors, so that &quot;similar&quot; molecules in the
collection can be quickly identified.
<p>

<li>
<i>Dimension Reduction</i>. Often, a table of molecular descriptors contains
columns that are correlated and differ in relative scale. This can be a problem
for distance-based diversity analysis since a Euclidean metric cannot be used
directly (without overemphasizing some subset of the descriptors).
QuaSAR-Cluster is capable of calculating a new table of descriptors, often
smaller, that are uncorrelated and normalized (mean 0 and variance 1).
<p>

<li>
<i>Assigning Weights</i>. When a moderately large collection of molecules is
used in a QSAR study, it is important that bias not be introduced due to the
particular selection of molecules. For example, near duplicate molecules can
bias the fit. QuaSAR-Cluster can assign weights to molecules so that, for
instance, the two near duplicate molecules will be assigned a weight of 0.5.
</ol>

<p>Suppose that we are given <i>m</i> molecules each of which is described by
an <i>n</i>-vector of real numbers
<i>x<sub>i</sub></i>=(<i>x</i><sub><i>i</i>1</sub>,...,<i>x<sub>in</sub></i>),
consisting of the descriptors for molecule <i>i</i>. Further, suppose that each
molecule has an associated importance weight, <i>w<sub>i</sub></i>, a
non-negative real number.  These weights can be thought of as the relative
probability that the associated molecule will be encountered and are usually
all equal to 1; however, in some applications, unequal weights are used.
Let <i>W</i> denote the sum of all the weights. </p>

<p>
<b>Principal Component Analysis</b>. Dimension reduction through <i>principal
component analysis</i> (PCA) can be interpreted in the following manner.
Let <i>X</i> denote a random <i>n</i>-vector and let <i>Z</i> denote a random
<i>p</i>-vector with mean 0 and covariance matrix equal to the identity matrix.
If we assume that <i>X</i>=<i>RZ</i>+<i>x</i><sub>0</sub> for some <i>n</i> by
<i>p</i> linear transform <i>R</i> and some
<i>n</i>-vector <i>x</i><sub>0</sub> then PCA is the estimation of the
<i>Z</i> vectors from a sample of <i>X</i> vectors.</p>

<p>
If we integrate both sides of the supposed affine transform we obtain:

<p align="center"><img src="cluster/mean.png"></p>

<p>which shows that <i>x</i><sub>0</sub> is the mean of the distribution of
the <i>X</i> vectors. Turning to the covariance of the <i>X</i> vectors, we
observe that:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="cluster/cov.png"></p>

<p>
These equations suggest the following method for estimating the <i>Z</i>
vectors. We use the sampled data to approximate both <i>E</i>(<i>X</i>) and
Cov(<i>X</i>):</p>

<p align="center"><img src="cluster/est.png"></p>

<p>
The sample covariance matrix, <i>S</i>, is now symmetric semi-definite; hence,
all of its eigenvalues are real and non-negative. We can therefore diagonalize
<i>S</i> so that:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="cluster/diag.png"></p>

<p>
where <i>Q</i> is orthogonal and <i>D</i> is diagonal-sorted in descending
order from top left to bottom right. Let <i>p</i> be the number of non-zero
diagonal values in <i>D</i> (the square roots of the eigenvalues of <i>S</i>).
We can estimate <i>R</i> as the first <i>p</i> columns of <i>Q<sup>T</sup>D</i>
and say that the <i>X</i> vectors have <i>p</i> principal components. In
practice, we restrict the selection of <i>p</i> further by limiting the
<i>condition</i> of the estimated <i>R<sup>T</sup>R </i>matrix; that is, we
choose <i>p</i> so that the largest eigenvalue divided by the smallest
eigenvalue is less than some specified threshold.</p>

<p>
<b>Cluster Determination</b>. The assignment of cluster codes to molecules
proceeds in <i>p</i> dimensional Euclidean space after estimating the
<i>p</i> principal components of the molecular descriptors. Each of the
<i>p</i> axes is divided into <i>k</i> intervals labeled &quot;a&quot;,
&quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, etc. Each of the <i>p</i> coordinates of a
molecule is assigned a letter code depending on the axis intervals into which
the coordinates fall. A cluster code is the concatenation of <i>p</i> letters.
More precisely, if <i>f</i>(<i>z</i>) is the probability density function for
a random variable <i>Z</i>, we determine
<i>b</i><sub>0</sub>,...,<i>b<sub>k</sub></i> with <i>b</i><sub>0</sub> equal
to minus infinity and <i>b<sub>k</sub></i> equal to plus infinity such that:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="cluster/prob.png"></p>

<p>
This corresponds to a percentile-type subdivision of space. If a coordinate
<i>z</i> is such that <i>z</i> is in the interval
(<i>b</i><sub><i>i</i>-1</sub>,<i>b<sub>i</sub></i>] then <i>z</i> is given
the <i>i</i>-th label.</p>

<p>
Let <i>z</i><sub>1</sub>,...,<i>z<sub>m</sub></i> be <i>m</i> samples of a
continuous random variable <i>Z</i>. We can estimate <i>f</i> by accumulating
a histogram of observed samples values on a set of <i>B</i> bins
(<i>b</i><sub>0</sub>,<i>b</i><sub>1</sub>],...,(<i>b</i><sub><i>B</i>-1</sub>,<i>b<sub>B</sub></i>]
defined by <i>B</i>+1 numbers
<i>b<sub>j</sub></i>&lt;<i>b</i><sub><i>j</i>+1</sub>,
with <i>b</i><sub>0</sub> equal to minus infinity and <i>b<sub>B</sub></i>
equal to plus infinity. The usual procedure for counting the number of
observations among <i>m</i> samples in bin <i>j</i>&gt;0 is:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="cluster/bins.png"></p>

<p>
which has unfortunate sensitivity to the selection of bin boundaries since
observations close to the boundary between two bins are treated as if they
were in the middle of one of the bins. To reduce the sensitivity to the bin
boundaries we replace the delta function observation density with a normal
random variable with mean <i>z<sub>i</sub></i> and variance
<i>s</i><sup>2</sup>. We now have</p>

<p align="center"><img src="cluster/smoothed.png">.</p>

<p>
Once the alphabetic cluster codes have been assigned, they are converted
into a single integer such that the sort order of the integers is the same
as the sort order of the original codes.  These single integers are written
as the output cluster codes.

<p>
<b>Weight Assignment.</b> Suppose that a cluster analysis has assigned a code
to each of the <i>m</i> molecules. Suppose further that <i>m<sub>i</sub></i>
is the number of molecules that have the same cluster code as molecule <i>i</i>.
QuaSAR-Cluster will output a weight of 1/<i>m<sub>i</sub></i> for molecule
<i>i</i>. For example, if a total of three out of the <i>m</i> molecules are
assigned a particular cluster code, then each of the three molecules will be
given a weight of 1/3.</p>

<p>
<b>Algorithm Summary</b>. The foregoing considerations are integrated into
the QuaSAR-Cluster computational procedure:

<ol>
  <li>Calculate the sample average vector <i>x</i><sub>0</sub> and covariance matrix <i>S</i>.</li>
  <li>Diagonalize <i>S</i> and select the <i>p</i> principal components.</li>
  <li>Form the PCA transform <i>Q</i> so that <i>Z</i>=<i>Q</i>(<i>x</i>-<i> x</i><sub>0</sub>)
    has identity covariance and mean 0.</li>
  <li>For each <i>i</i> write the <i>p-</i>vector <i>z<sub>i</sub></i>=Q(<i>x<sub>i</sub></i>-<i>
    x</i><sub>0</sub>) to the output.</li>
  <li>Estimate <i>p</i> probability density functions from the <i>z<sub>i</sub></i>.</li>
  <li>For each density function compute the percentile-type intervals.</li>
  <li>For each <i>i</i> output a cluster label based on the <i>p</i> coordinates of the <i>z<sub>i</sub></i>.</li>
  <li>For each <i>i</i> determine <i>m<sub>i</sub></i> the number of molecules with the same
    cluster code.</li>
  <li>For each <i>i</i> output the weight 1/<i>m<sub>i</sub></i>.</li>
</ol>

<p>The procedure has the following parameters (explained in the foregoing equations):

<ul>
  <tt>
  <li>maxcomp</tt> : the maximum number of components (the maximum value of <i>p</i>).</li>
  <tt>
  <li>maxcond</tt> : the maximum condition of the <i>Q<sup>T</sup>Q</i> transform.</li>
  <tt>
  <li>swidth</tt> : the normal histogram smoothing width, <i>s</i>.</li>
  <tt>
  <li>ncodes</tt> : the number of subdivisions per axis, <i>k</i>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Running the Calculation</h2>

<p>QuaSAR-Cluster can be invoked in several ways:

<ul>
<li>Open the database in the Database Viewer and choose 
<span class="menu">DBV | Compute | Descriptors | Clusters</span>. 
Since the command was
selected from a Molecular Database Viewer menu, the source database is
specified by the Molecular Database Viewer. 

<p><li>In the MOE Window, choose 
<span class="menu">MOE | Compute | QuaSAR | QuaSAR-Cluster</span>. In this case
you will be prompted to select the molecular database file that is to be
operated upon. This invocation is useful when the calculation is to be
performed on a database that is not to be opened with the Molecular
Database Viewer.  <p>

<li>
<a class="svl" href="fcnref/cluster.htm">QuaSAR_ClusterMDB</a> in batch mode or
from the SVL command line.

</ul>

<p>
When the calculation is invoked from a menu, the following panel appears:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="cluster/cluster.png" alt="QuaSAR-Cluster Panel"></p>

<p><table width=100% cellpadding=5>
<tr>
<td valign=top><b>Source&nbsp;Database</b>
<td valign=top>Path and filename of the database that contains the fields to be
analyzed. 

<p>If the <b>Use Selected Entries Only</b> option is turned on, then only the
database entries (rows) that are selected in the Molecular Database Viewer
will be used in the calculation.

<tr>
<td valign=top><b>Weight Field</b>
<td valign=top>Name of the field that will be used to weight individual entries of the
database. These weights should be non-negative; negative weights will be set
to zero for the calculation. If the Weight Field is set to (NONE), then all
entries will have a weight of 1.

<tr>
<td valign=top><b>Fields</b>
<td valign=top>List of all the numeric fields in the database. If no fields
are selected, then all the numeric fields (except the Weight Field) will be
used in the calculation. If fields are selected in the list, the selected
fields will be used in the calculation and the unselected fields will be
ignored.

<tr>
<td valign=top><b>De-correlate Descriptors</b>
<td valign=top>If turned on, the full principal components analysis will be performed
as described above. Otherwise, if not turned on, then off-diagonal elements of the
covariance matrix will be set to zero before the diagonalization and
dimension reduction step.  This has the effect of enforcing an assumption
that the descriptors are uncorrelated.

<tr>
<td valign=top><b>Equiprobable Subdivision</b>
<td valign=top>If turned on, then the subdivision of the probability density into equiprobable
regions (as described above) will be performed.  If not checked, then each
principal component axis will be subdivided into regions of equal volume.

<tr>
<td valign=top><b>Output Database</b>
<td valign=top>Filename of the database into which the results of the
calculation will be written. If this filename is different from the Source
Database, a new database will be created. If the Output Database is empty or
equal to the Source Database, the results will be written to the Source
Database. If the Output Database is different from the Source Database, all
database fields except those used in the analysis will be copied to the
Output Database.

<tr>
<td valign=top><b>Principal Components</b>
<td valign=top>If turned on, then the calculated principal
components will be written in fields prefixed with the text in
<b>Field Prefix</b>. For example, the default Field Prefix is
&quot;PCA&quot;; if there are four principal components then these values will
be written in fields PCA1, PCA2, PCA3 and PCA4.

<tr>
<td valign=top><b>Cluster Code</b>
<td valign=top>If turned on, then the calculated cluster code will be
written to the integer-type field named in the <b>Cluster Field</b>. If
the field already exists, then it will be overwritten.

<tr>
<td valign=top><b>Cluster Weight</b>
<td valign=top>If turned on, then a new field with the name given in
<b>New Weight Field</b> will be created and will contain the inverse of the
number of members in the cluster of each entry. If the field already exists,
then it will be overwritten.
For example, if a particular
entry is assigned a code that is identical to three other entries, then a
value of 0.25 will be written.

<tr>
<td valign=top><b>Smoothing</b>
<td valign=top>Width of the smoothing distribution used in
accumulating the distributions during clustering. It is the standard
deviation of a normal distribution (the <i>s</i> value in the theory section).
This field is not used if Cluster Code is not turned on.

<tr>
<td valign=top><b>Code Count</b>
<td valign=top>Number of equiprobable subdivisions of each principal
component axis; that is, the number of letter codes used per axis. Smaller
values lead to fewer clusters.

<tr>
<td valign=top><b>Component Limit</b>
<td valign=top>Limit on the number of principal components
selected. A value of zero means that no limit is set; otherwise, at most the
specified number of largest principal components will be used.

<tr>
<td valign=top><b>Condition Limit</b>
<td valign=top>Maximum condition (see theory section)
number of the principal component transform.
