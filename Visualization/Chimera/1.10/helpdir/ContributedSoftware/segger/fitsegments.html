<p>
<b>Fit to Segments</b> rigidly fits atomic structures into 
<a href="segment.html">segmentation regions</a>
from <a href="segment.html"><b>Segment Map</b></a>.
Along with that tool, it is part of the 
<a href="http://ncmi.bcm.edu/ncmi/software/segger" 
target="_blank"><b>Segger</b> package</a> described in:
<blockquote>
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20338243" target="_blank">
Quantitative analysis of cryo-EM density map segmentation by watershed and 
scale-space filtering, and fitting of structures by alignment to regions.</a>

There are <a href="../../UsersGuide/extension.html">several ways to start</a>
<b>Fit to Segments</b>, a tool in the <b>Volume Data</b> category
(including from the
<a href="../volumeviewer/framevolumeviewer.html" 
target="_top"><b>Volume Viewer</b></a>
<b>Tools</b> menu).
</p><p>
The <b>Structure to fit</b> should be chosen from the pulldown menu
of molecule models.  Any atoms in the model that are not desired for fitting,
such as solvent or extra chains, should be
<a href="../editing/editing.html#deletion">deleted</a> 
before the fitting is done. 
</p><p>
Clicking <b>Fit</b> performs the fitting.  
The default <a href="#options">settings</a> are to fit the structure
to the <a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html">selected</a> regions
using the principal axes method.  The regions are made transparent;
region transparency/opacity can be adjusted further using the 
<a href="segment.html#menu-regions"><b>Regions</b>
menu</a> in <a href="segment.html"><b>Segment Map</b></a> or
the main Chimera menu
<a href="../../UsersGuide/menu.html#actsurface"><b>Actions... Surface</b></a>.
</p><p>
<a name="table">Fit information is shown in a table</a>:
<ul>
<li><a name="corr"><b>Corr</b></a>
- the <a href="../fitmaps/fitmaps.html#correlation">correlation</a>,
also known as the <b><i>cross-correlation score</i></b>,
between the map within the 
<a href="segment.html">segmentation region(s)</a> used for fitting and 
the map <a href="#molmap">generated from the atomic structure</a>
<li><b>Molecule</b> - the chosen structure
<li><b>Map</b> - the density map from which the
<a href="segment.html">segmentation region(s)</a> were derived
<li><b>Region</b> - the <a href="segment.html">segmentation region(s)</a> used
for fitting
</ul>
One or more rows (fits) can be chosen with the mouse. 
The structure is repositioned as each fit is chosen.
The chosen fit(s) can be saved to PDB files or removed from the table using
the <b>Fit to Segments</b> <a href="#menu-file"><b>File</b> menu</a>.
</p>
<a name="options">Clicking <b>Options</b></a> reveals additional settings
(clicking the close button <img src ="../volumeviewer/x.png"> on the right
hides them again):
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type:none"><a name="molmap"><b>Density map resolution 
[<i>r</i>] grid spacing [<i>s</i>]</b></a>
- set parameters for generating a density map from the atomic structure,
to allow calculating <a href="#corr">correlation</a> values for fits.
Each atom is described as a 3D Gaussian distribution of width proportional
to the resolution <i>r</i> and amplitude proportional to the atomic number
(as is done by the command 
<a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/molmap.html"><b>molmap</b></a>).
The grid spacing <i>s</i> is the separation of points 
along the X, Y, and Z axes of the generated map. 
The resolution and spacing should be approximately the same as
for the map into which the structure is being fit (the map that was
<a href="segment.html">segmented</a>).
Clicking <b>Fit</b> or <b>Calculate Map</b> will generate the map from the
structure if it does not already exist.
<br><br>
<li style="list-style-type:none"><b>Which regions to use for fitting</b>:
  <ul>
  <li><b>Combined selected regions</b> (default)
  - use the <a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html">selected</a> 
  sementation regions collectively
  <li><b>Each selected region</b>
  - use each <a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html">selected</a> 
  segmentation region for a separate fit
  <li><b>Groups of regions including selected region</b>
  - generate groups of segmentation regions that include the
  <a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html">selected</a> one, try 
  fitting to each group; save the best fits in the <a href="#table">table</a>
  <li><b>Groups of regions including all regions</b>
  - combinatorially group subsets of all segmentation regions, try 
  fitting to each group; save the best fits in the <a href="#table">table</a>
  </ul>
<br>
<li style="list-style-type:none"><a name="method"><b>Alignment method</b></a>:
  <ul>
  <li><b>Align principal axes (faster)</b> (default)
  - align centers, then principal axes from longest to shortest.
  The center and principal axes of a structure are calculated from
  its atomic coordinates, non-mass-weighted.
  The center and principal axes of a region or group of regions
  are calculated from the voxels they enclose;
  all grid points inside the surface(s) are weighted equally.
  The principal axes are the eigenvectors of a covarience matrix. 
  An eigenvector gives the direction of each axis, but the signs of these 
  directions are ambiguous. When performing the alignment, 
  the signs are flipped to generate four possible transforms. 
  Only non-reflecting transforms are considered, in which either 
  none or two of the three axes are flipped.
  The fit with the highest <a href="#corr">correlation</a> is kept.
  <p>
  The principal axes of the atomic structure can be shown/hidden with
  the <a href="#menu-file"><b>File</b> menu</a> in <b>Fit to Segments</b>.
  The principal axes of segmentation regions can be shown with the 
  <a href="segment.html#menu-regions"><b>Regions</b>
  menu</a> in <a href="segment.html"><b>Segment Map</b></a>.
  </p>
  <li><b>Rotational search (more reliable)</b> 
  - align centers, then exhaustively rotate the structure to find the best fit.
  The alignment with the highest <a href="#corr">correlation</a> is kept.
  <br><br>
  <li><b>Optimize fits</b> (on by default) - whether to perform a
  <a href="../fitmaps/fitmaps.html#optimization">local optimization</a> of
  each fit. Optimization uses density both inside and outside the region(s) 
  used in the initial fit, and can move the structure far from the region(s).
  </ul>

<li><b>Save chosen fit molecules</b>
- save a PDB file of the structure in its fit position for 
each chosen row in the <a href="#table">table of fits</a>
</ul><ul>
<li><b>Place molecule copies</b>
- add a copy of the structure in its fit position (as a new model) for
each chosen row in the <a href="#table">table of fits</a>
<li><b>Delete fits from list</b>

<li><b>Show molecule axes</b> 
- display the <a href="#method">principal axes</a>
of the atomic structure as arrows
<li><b>Hide molecule axes</b>
- hide the <a href="#method">principal axes</a> of the atomic structure
<li><b>Show overlapping regions</b> - display only the regions that
overlap the atomic structure in its current position
