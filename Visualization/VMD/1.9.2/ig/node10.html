<P>
If you are running a VMD binary which has been built with a
native OpenGL implementation (i.e. not Mesa), you should make sure
that you have the vendor provided OpenGL runtime libraries and the
X server extensions correctly installed.  SGI systems normally have
the OpenGL runtime support installed on them.  Sun, HP, and IBM systems
often do not come with OpenGL support by default.  If you don't have the 
OpenGL runtime libraries for these systems, they can be downloaded for free
from the Sun, HP, and IBM web sites respectively.  Each of the vendor's OpenGL 
implementations generally include "install check" programs which verify
the correct installation and operation of the OpenGL libraries.

<P>

<LI>Sun's OpenGL site is at <TT>http://www.sun.com/software/graphics/opengl/</TT>

We suggest that you check that you are doing everything correctly,
and if it still doesn't work, report the problem by e-mail to
<TT>vmd@ks.uiuc.edu</TT>. We'll try to help you.
