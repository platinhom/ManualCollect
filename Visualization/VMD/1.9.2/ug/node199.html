<BR>
Using the <TT>atomselect</TT> command
</H1>

<P>
Atom selection is the primary method to access information about
the atoms in a molecule.  It works in two steps. The first step is to create a 
selection given the selection text, molecule id, and optional frame 
number. This is done by a function called <TT>atomselect</TT>, which returns the
name of the new atom selection. the second step is to use the created 
selection to access the information about the atoms in the selections.

<P>
Atom selection is implemented as a Tcl function.  The data
returned from <TT>atomselect</TT> is the name of the function to use.
The name is of the form <TT>atomselect%d</TT> where '%d' is a non-negative
number (such as 'atomselect0', atomselect26', ...).

<P>
The way to use the function created by the <TT>atomselect</TT> command
is to store the name into a variable, then use the variable to get the
name when needed.
<A NAME="15802"></A>
<A NAME="15803"></A>
<PRE>
vmd&gt; set sel [atomselect top "water"]
atomselect3
vmd&gt; $sel text
water
</PRE>
This is equivalent to saying
<PRE>
vmd&gt; atomselect3 text
</PRE>

<P>
The easiest way of thinking about this is that the <TT>atomselect</TT>
command creates an object.  To get information from the object you
have to send it a command.  Thus, in the example above (<TT>atomselect1 num</TT>) the object "atomselect1" was sent the command "num",
which asks the object to return the number of atoms in the selection.
These derived object functions (the ones with names like atomselect3)
take many options, as described in 
section <A HREF="node122.html#ug:ui:text:atomselect">9.3.2</A>,

<P>
For instance, given the selection
<PRE>
vmd&gt; set sel [atomselect top "resid 4"]
atomselect4
</PRE>
you can get the atom names for each of the atoms in the selection with
<PRE>
vmd&gt; $sel get name
N H CA CB C O
</PRE>
  (which, remember, is the same as
<PRE>
vmd&gt; atomselect4 get name
</PRE>
)

<P>
Multiple attributes can be requested by submitting a list, so if you
want to see which atoms are on the backbone,
<PRE>
vmd&gt; $sel get {name backbone}
{N 1} {H 0} {CA 1} {CB 0} {C 1} {O 1}
</PRE>

<P>
and the atom coordinates with
<PRE>
vmd&gt;  $sel get {x y z}
{0.710000 4.211000 1.093000} {-0.026000 3.700000 0.697000} {0.541000
4.841000 2.388000} {-0.809000 4.462000 2.976000} {1.591000 4.371000
3.381000} {2.212000 5.167000 4.085000}
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="15821"></A>
Note that the format of the data you get back from the <TT>get</TT> command
depends on how many attributes you requested.  If you request only one
attribute, as in the <TT>get name</TT> example above, you will get back
a simple list of elements.  On the other hand, if you request two or
more attributes, you will get back a list of sublists.  Specifically,
it is a list of size <IMG
 WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img35.png"
 ALT="$ n$">
 where each element is itself a list of size <IMG
 WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img42.png"
 ALT="$ i$">
,
where <IMG
 WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img35.png"
 ALT="$ n$">
 is the number of atoms in the selection and <IMG
 WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img42.png"
 ALT="$ i$">
 is the number
of attributes requested.

<P>
<A NAME="15824"></A>
Your scripts will run faster if you retrieve only one attribute at a time,
because then VMD does not have to construct the sublists for each 
attribute.  Remember that in Tcl you can loop over several lists at once
using the <TT>foreach</TT> command:
<PRE>
foreach resid [$sel get resid] resname [$sel get resname] {
  # process each resid and resname here
}
</PRE>

<P>
One quick function you can build with the coordinates is a method to
calculate the geometrical center (not quite the center of mass; that's a
bit harder). This also uses some of the vector commands discussed in
the section about <A HREF="node192.html#ug:topic:vectors">vectors and matrices</A>, but you should be
able to figure them out from context.
<A NAME="15832"></A>
<A NAME="15833"></A>
<PRE>
proc geom_center {selection} {
        # set the geometrical center to 0
        set gc [veczero]
        # [$selection get {x y z}] returns a list of {x y z} 
        #    values (one per atoms) so get each term one by one
        foreach coord [$selection get {x y z}] {
           # sum up the coordinates
           set gc [vecadd $gc $coord]
        }
        # and scale by the inverse of the number of atoms
        return [vecscale [expr 1.0 /[$selection num]] $gc]
}
</PRE>

<P>
With that defined you can say (assuming $sel was created with the
previous atomselection example)
<PRE>
vmd&gt; geom_center $sel
0.703168 4.45868 2.43667
</PRE>
I'll go through the example line by line.  The function is named 
<TT>geom_center</TT> and takes one parameter, the name of the selection.
The first line sets the variable ``gc'' to the zero vector, which is 0
0 0.  On the second line of code, two things occur.  First, the command
<PRE>
   $selection get {x y z}
</PRE>
is executed, and the string is replaced with the result, which is
<PRE>
{0.710000 4.211000 1.093000} {-0.026000 3.700000 0.697000} {0.541000
4.841000 2.388000} {-0.809000 4.462000 2.976000} {1.591000 4.371000
3.381000} {2.212000 5.167000 4.085000}
</PRE>
This is a list of 6 terms (one for each atom in the selection), and
each term is a list of three elements, the x, y, and z coordinate, in
that order.

<P>
The "foreach" command splits the list into its six terms and goes down
the list term by term, setting the variable "coord" to each successive
term.  Inside the loop, the value of $coord is added to total sum.

<P>
The last line returns the geometrical center of the atoms in the selection.  
Since the geometrical
center is defined as the sum of the coordinate vectors divided by the
number of elements, and so far I have only calculated the sum of
vectors, I need the inverse of the number of elements, which is
done with the expression
<PRE>
    expr 1.0 / [$selection num]
</PRE>
The decimal in "1.0" is important since otherwise Tcl does integer
division.  Finally, this value is used to scale the sum of the
coordinate vectors (with vecscale), which returns the new value, which
is itself returned as the result of the procedure.

<P>
The center of mass function is slightly harder because you have to
get the mass as well as the x, y, z values, then break that up into
to components.  
The formula for the center of mass is 
<!-- MATH
 $\sum m_i x_i/\sum mass_i$
 -->
<IMG

proc center_of_mass {selection} {
        # some error checking
        if {[$selection num] &lt;= 0} {
                error "center_of_mass: needs a selection with atoms"
        }
        # set the center of mass to 0

        # so the following says "for each pair of {coordinates} and masses,
	#  do the computation ..."
        foreach coord [$selection get {x y z}] m [$selection get mass] {
           # sum of the masses
           set mass [expr $mass + $m]
           # sum up the product of mass and coordinate
           set com [vecadd $com [vecscale $m $coord]]
        }
        # and scale by the inverse of the number of atoms
        if {$mass == 0} {
                error "center_of_mass: total mass is zero"
        }
        # The "1.0" can't be "1", since otherwise integer division is done
        return [vecscale [expr 1.0/$mass] $com]
}

</PRE>

<P>
The opposite of "get" is "set".  Many keywords (most notably,
"x", "y", and "z") can be set to new values.  This allows, for
instance, atom coordinates to be changed, the occupancy values to be
updated, or user forces to be added.  You can also change the resname,
segid, and so forth, which may be easier to do within VMD than, for
example, editing a PDB file by hand.
<PRE>
  set sel [atomselect top "index 5"]
  $sel get {x y z}
{1.450000 0.000000 0.000000}
  $set set {x y z} {{1.6 0 0}}
</PRE>
<A NAME="15853"></A>
<A NAME="15854"></A>

<P>
Note that just as the get option returned a list of lists, the set
option needs a list of lists, which is why the extra set of curly
braces were need.  Again, this must be a list of size <IMG
 WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img35.png"
 ALT="$ n$">

containing elements which are a list of size <IMG
 WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img42.png"
 ALT="$ i$">
.  The exeception is
if <IMG
 WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img35.png"
 ALT="$ n$">
 is 1, the list is duplicated enough times so there is one
element for each atom.
<PRE>
  # get two atoms and set their coordinates
  set sel [atomselect top "index 6 7"]
  $sel set {x y z} { {5 0 0} {7.6 5.4 3.2} }
</PRE>

<P>
In this case, the atom with index 6 gets its (x, y, z) values set to
5 0 0 and the atom with index 7 has its coordinates changed to 7.6
5.4 3.2.

<P>
It is possible to move atoms this way by getting the coordinates,
changing them (say by adding some offset) and replacing it.  Following is a function which will do just that:

<P>
<A NAME="15859"></A>
<PRE>
proc moveby {sel offset} {
  foreach coord [$sel get {x y z}] {
    lappend newcoords [vecadd $coord $offset]
  }
  $sel set {x y z} $newcoords
}
</PRE>
And to use this function (in this case, to apply an offset of (x y z)
<IMG
 WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img49.png"
 ALT="$ =$">
 (0.1 -2.8 9) to the selection "$movesel"):
<PRE>
moveby $movesel {0.1 -2.8 9}
</PRE>
However, to simplify matters some options have been added to the
selection to deal with movements (these commands are also implemented
in C++ and are much faster than the Tcl versions).  These functions
are <TT>moveby</TT>, <TT>moveto</TT>, and <TT>move</TT>.  The first two take a
position vector and the last takes a transformation matrix.

<P>
<A NAME="15867"></A>
The first command, <TT>moveby</TT>, moves each of the atoms in the
selection over by the given vector offset.
<PRE>
   $sel moveby {1 -1 3.4}
</PRE>
The second, <TT>moveto</TT>, moves all the atoms in a selection to a
given coordinate (it would be strange to use this for a selection of
more than one atom, but that's allowed).  Example:
<PRE>
   $sel moveto {-1 1 4.3}
</PRE>
  The last of those, <TT>move</TT>, applies the given transformation
matrix to each of the atom coordinates.  This is best used for
rotating a set of atoms around a given axis, as in
<PRE>
   $sel move [trans x 90]
</PRE>
which rotates the selection 90 degrees about the x axis.  Of course,
any transformation matrix may be used.

<P>
A more useful
example is the following, which rotates the side chain atoms around
the CA-CB bond by 10 degrees. <A NAME="15877"></A>
<PRE>
# get the sidechain atoms (CB and onwards)
set sidechain [atomselect top "sidechain residue 22"]
# get the CA coordinates -- could do next two on one line ...
set CA [atomselect top "name CA and residue 22"]
set CAcoord [lindex [$CA get {x y z}] 0]
# and get the CB coordinates
set CB [atomselect top "name CB and residue 22"]
set CBcoord [lindex [$CB get {x y z}] 0]
# apply a transform of 10 degrees about the given bond axis
$sidechain move [trans bond $CAcoord $CBcoord 10 deg]
</PRE>
