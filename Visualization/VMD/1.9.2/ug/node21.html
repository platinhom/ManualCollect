Comparing Two Structures</A>
</H1>

<P>
Let's start from scratch by deleting everything: use the text
console and tye the command <TT>mol delete all</TT> and press enter.
This deletes all loaded molecules and is often more convenient
then selecting them and deleting them all one by one.  Alternatively,
you could highlight each molecule in the molecule browser, and
use the <I>Delete Molecule</I> item in the <I>Molecule</I> menu to 
remove them one by one.

<P>
Begin by loading the <TT>mbco.pdb</TT> structure with the Files window.
Turn on just the heme, CO, and histidines by using the selection commands
<TT>resname HEM CO or resid 64 93</TT>.  The dot (probably green) in the
middle is the iron and you can verify that by picking it with the
mouse.  Do this by changing the ``Object Mode'' pull-down to ``Pick'', and
selecting ``Atoms'' for the pick mode in the Mouse menu.
The label <TT>HEM154:FE</TT> should appear both on the display
and in the text console.<A NAME="976"></A><A NAME="977"></A>
<A NAME="978"></A>

<P>
Change the pick mode in the Mouse menu to ``Bonds''.
To get the distance between the iron and the oxygen of the CO, click
with the left mouse button first on the iron and then on the oxygen.
<A NAME="979"></A><A NAME="980"></A>
The first click turned the FE label on and the second turned the O
label on and drew a line between the two atoms with the distance drawn
in the middle and a bit to the right.  
<A NAME="981"></A>
<A NAME="982"></A>
The distance between the two
atoms is 2.94 &#197;, as compared to 2.93 &#197; in the paper; not bad.
However, picking the distance between the FE and the C of the CO
reveals a distance of 1.91 &#197; as compared to 1.85 &#197; in the paper.
The difference is that the structures in the VMD distribution are
actually preliminary structures obtained before the final coordinates
were determined.

<P>
In order to experiment with more complex picking modes, 
<A NAME="983"></A>
<A NAME="984"></A>
consider the
angle made by the O of the CO with the FE of the heme and the NE2 of
residue 93 (you can click on the atoms to find which ones are which).
Using the Mouse menu, change the pick mode to ``Angles''.
This should cause the cursor to become a red crosshair.  
Click on each of the three atoms using the left mouse button.  After
the third pick, a shallow angle will appear indicating an 8.71 degree
angle between the three atoms.

<P>
Now load the intermediate <TT>star.pdb</TT> file which can also be found
in the <TT>proteins</TT> directory of your distribution. Again use the
Files window to do this.  Both of the molecules will be loaded side by
side.  Go to the Graphics window and change the selection so it the same
as the first, i.e. <TT>resname HEM CO or resid 64 93</TT>.  The two
molecules are almost atop each other, making it hard to distinguish
the two, so change the colors to simplify things.

<P>
First, in the <I>Graphics</I> window, change the <I>Coloring method</I> to
`Molecule'.  Use the <I>Selected Molecule</I> chooser to change the
<TT>mbco.pdb</TT> <I>Coloring method</I> to `Molecule' as well.  Open the
<A HREF="node47.html#ug:ui:window:color"
 NAME="997"><I>Color</I> window</A>
<A NAME="998"></A>
and scroll the <I>Category</I> browser down until the line `Molecule'
is visible.  Click on it then click on the line which says <TT>mbco.pdb</TT>.  (There may be two <TT>mbco</TT> lines if the file had been loaded
before in this session.)  Scroll the <I>Colors</I> browser up to click
on `blue'.  This should change one of the molecules in the display to
blue. <A NAME="1003"></A>

<P>
Next, click on the last line in the <I>Names</I> chooser, which says
<TT>star.pdb</TT>.  This time, choose `red' from the <I>Colors</I>
chooser.
The display should be much easier to understand.  The myoglobin with
the bound CO is in blue and the intermediate state is in red.  At this
point it is easy to measure the change in position between the two
different states by using the middle mouse button to pick the same
atom in the two conformations.  

<P>
Once that is done, it is easy to point out one interesting aspect of
the way VMD handles the graphics.  Go to the main window, select one of
the two molecules, and press <I>Toggle Fixed</I>.  Enter translation
mode and move the other molecule around.  Notice that the number which
lists the distance between the two atoms never changes.  That's
because the mouse only affects the way the coordinates are translated
to the screen image.  It does not affect the real coordinates at all.
It is possible to change the coordinates in a molecule using the text
command interface, or by using the 
<A HREF="node33.html#ug:ui:disp:pick">atom move pick modes</A>).
<A NAME="1012"></A>
<A NAME="1013"></A>
<A NAME="1014"></A>

<P>
By the way, unfix the molecules and do a `Reset View' from the Display
menu to reset everything.  Load up the third structure, <TT>deoxy.pdb</TT> 
and give it the same selection as the other two molecules.
However, color this one green.  Pull out Nature v. 371, Oct. 27, 1994
and turn to page 740.  With a bit of manipulation you should be able
to recreate the image that appears there.
